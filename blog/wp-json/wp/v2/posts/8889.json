With this many apps available, there is a good enough chance that user won\u2019t even give your app more than one glance. You need to make your app is interesting enough that they come back to it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than one third of mobile app engagement last less than a minute<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

First of All, Avoid these 6 Things Rightway <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most basic mobile app monetization strategies is to make your app successful. And everyone tells you about what you should do. But today, We\u2019ll tell you what <strong>\u2018not to do\u2019<\/strong>!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, there are a number of reasons why <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/reinvently.com\/blog\/top-3-harsh-reasons-why-mobile-apps-fail\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">67% of app developers fall below the app poverty line<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So take a look at this if you want your app to succeed\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Poor Market And Audience Research<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market and audience research is the backbone of monetizing your app. If you have not done enough research on the market and audience you are targeting with your app, then do it now. If you don\u2019t understand the audience needs, then no matter what mobile app monetization strategy you apply, it won\u2019t make you money.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Zero Originality Of The App Idea<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The app store is full of different apps offering the same features. To make money with your app, you need originality. Consider your competition, and what features they are offering. Create a unique value proposition for your app, or there will be no money from it as it is one of the best ways to monetize your app. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Ignoring Platform Requirements<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/android-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\">developing the app for Android<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/ios-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\">iOS<\/a>, ignoring the platform requirements will not result in success for your app. Each platform has unique requirements that you need to meet to satisfy the users.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Bad User Experience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a very basic way, your app needs to be easy to use for the users. If they struggle to search for something on your app, then there is no point of having the search function. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Related Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/mobile-app-development-company-5-proven-reasons-why-customers-are-not-using-your-app\/\" target=\"_blank\">5 Reasons Why Users Might Discard Your App!<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slow or lagging app with long loading process is going to put off the user. Your app needs to give the user the best app experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Lack Of Proper Testing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of proper testing can become the downfall of an app. So don\u2019t ignore the importance of testing your app to see if it is working properly. Doing this will eliminate major issues from your app. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Ill-executed App Launch<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sloppy app launch can lead the users to lose interest in your app. If you want them to love your app, plan exciting pre-launch activities for your app, such as email notification, advertisements. Execute them perfectly to hype up the users for your app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have considered all the factors important to make your app worth making money, it is time to find out which platform is going to help you achieve that goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iOS or Android- Which Platform Is Going To Make More Money For You?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe you have already decided on which platform you are going to design your app for. But if you have not, then you should read on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different platforms have different app requirements. And they can also make you a different amount of money.

Stay tuned for our research.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finalizing The Mobile App Monetization Strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know all the ways to make money with your app, you are probably thinking which way is best for you. Before you start planning about the monetization of your app, there are the last few things you need to consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Set Up The Value Proposition Of Your App<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The value proposition of your app is something that outlines the benefits your users are going to get from the app. There are millions of apps in the app store, and you need to give the users a compelling reason to download your app, and not your competitors. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, the value proposition of your app is incredibly important. Based on this, you are going to choose which mobile app monetization strategy will work for your app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how are you going to create your value proposition? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, think about what your user needs, and then consider how your app is going to help them. Make a clear and concise statement dedicated to your users, telling them how exactly the app is going to help them in their lives, the benefits they are going to receive from it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In brief, the value proposition of your app needs to tell the reader why they should invest in the app. Whichever mobile app monetization strategy you are using, if the value proposition of your app is not good, you won\u2019t be able to make money with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Your App And It\u2019s Unique Features<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are probably more than hundreds of apps out there similar to the one you are building. So why are users going to install your app, and not one of the others?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will you distinguish your apps in this harsh competition? Is there a way that you can make your user stick to your app?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Related Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/how-to-build-habit-forming-technology-the-future-of-enterprise-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\">Secrets to Make Your App Habit Forming!<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer is simple. To compete with the harsh competition, you need unique features on your app. In addition the basic features like the search option and social media sharing features, there need to be more unique features which are not available in any other competitor apps. Only then users would consider buying your app or paying for those unique features.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/photo-sharing-apps\/\" target=\"_blank\">developing a photo sharing app<\/a>, you can offer unique filters and photo editing features to your users. That way they won\u2019t have to use another app to edit their photos before they post on your app. For a video streaming app, you can offer the users a vertical video player. Most of the time we have to turn out phone sideways to watch a video. But letting the users play videos horizontally without compromising the video quality or experience is going to make your app stand out among the competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Analyzing The Competition <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you start working with any of the above-mentioned app monetization models, stop and think, what are your competitors doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at any of the app similar to yours already in the market, and consider their choice of monetization technique, what unique feature they have and how are they using these features to make money? Is it befitting them? Or is it harming their business? Considering these details before you select a monetization model for your app will help you to make sure that your chances of making money are not harmed in any way. After all, the devil is in the details.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. The Growth Of Your App User Base<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How are you going to keep increasing your user base? This is something that is going to affect the monetization of your app hugely. If your user base stops growing and becomes stagnant, no matter what kind of monetization technique you use, it\u2019s not going to help you. You have to make sure the users keep using your app, and new users keep installing your app.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Related Read:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/how-to-build-habit-forming-technology-the-future-of-enterprise-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\"> ANSWERED: How to Make Your App Habit Forming!<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how are you going to do that?

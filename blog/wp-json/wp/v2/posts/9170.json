And as we know, all online presence starts with a website. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are reading this then we can just assume that you already know what websites are and how they are made and all that and move on to the matter of web designing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/web-design-new-york\/\" target=\"_blank\">Web designing<\/a><\/span> is the process of presenting your information through design, layout, and texts on a webpage. You might have used the term web designing interchangeably with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/web-development-company\/\" target=\"_blank\">web development<\/a>. But they are not the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turns out just having a website is not enough for your online presence. You need to have a STRONG online presence, and that is where web designing comes to play. In its basic&#8230;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web designing is about presenting and structuring information in a way that is easy for users to find out what they are looking for and make a sense of it. With careful consideration of parameters such as layout, hierarchy, placement, balance, contrast, and components like fonts, shapes, icons, and images, a website makes a better impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like fashion, web designs also have their own trends. And those change, more often than not. For professional web designers and business owners, it is important to be aware of the latest ones. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the question is, why do you need to keep up with the web designing? Let\u2019s look at a few of the reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Keep Up?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is tempting to go against the current and do something that is completely opposite of the recent trends. You might not want to be the sheep, but the shepherd when it comes to web designing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But unfortunately, sometimes, you have to be the trend follower, rather than a trendsetter. Why though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping up with the designing trends is the best way to keep your audience, or visitor engaged. A fresh design will convince them that whatever service you are providing, is relevant to the current times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An outdated website makes the visitor think that you don\u2019t care about your business. And if you don\u2019t care about your business, why would you care about the clients?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another good reason why you need to keep up with them is to keep up with your competitors. You might think that you don\u2019t need to follow ones, because your service is good, and that is enough to get clients. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the while, your competitor is going to go with the latest design trends and win over the clients hearts, and take away your business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to strengthen your online presence, then following the online design trends is the best way to do it. But it doesn\u2019t mean you have to blindly follow them. You can mix them up, even add a personal touch to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, it\u2019s all about having an eye-catching website that will impress your clients and get them to engage with your site. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important Factors To Consider While Talking About 2019 Web Design Trends<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you are convinced that you should look at the latest web designing trends and maybe use one or two on your website, it\u2019s time to talk about another important thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few factors you need to consider before you start designing your website. What are they? Well, let&#8217;s see-<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A. Your Audience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obviously, your audience is a factor you need to consider before you design your website. Knowing your audience is always the first step of any business venture. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does your audience like? What kind of content do they want to see on the pages? What are their preferences between images and videos? Knowing all this is going to help you optimize your website in a way that will make them spend more time on it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which in turn will increase your business?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B. Is Navigation Easy?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A complex layout may look overwhelming, but it\u2019s not going to make your audience happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a simple layout is important. Your website needs to be easy to navigate. Remember, the visitor is not going to spend more than one minute to search for something on their website. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the visitor sees that finding something on your site is hard, they will leave and go over to some other website. Maybe it&#8217;ll be your competitor\u2019s website with it\u2019s less pretty but easy layout. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So have a simple and easy to navigate layout. It\u2019s that simple.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C. How Fast Is It Loading?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all want fast loading webpages. The moment we feel that it\u2019s taking too long. We just close the tab and then open another website that is going to load quicker. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The visitor Is not going to wait for even one moment longer for your website to load. So making sure that your website has a fast loading speed is monumental in your website\u2019s success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even Google rewards the fast loading websites by giving them good ranks in SERP (Search Engine Result Page). So consider the loading speed before designing your website. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D. Appearance Of The Page<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While planning the appearance, you need to make it as pleasing to the eyes as possible. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/psychology-of-web-design\/\">A beautiful website goes a long way to impress the visitor<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The images and videos that go on your website need to complement your website. The color palette you are choosing should match with your logo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be tempting to add amazing high-quality images and videos, but that can slow down the loading speed of your website. So be cautious, don\u2019t compromise the loading speed of your website for the sake of beautiful images.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E. Call To Action (CTA)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just getting visitors to your website is not enough. You need to convert them. For that, you need Call To Action (CTA) element on your webpage. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the visitor spends a lot of time on your website, there is a better chance that they will convert. And for that, you need a call to action elements. These can be anything from, sign up buttons, to contact, or download an e-book or get a call. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day you need to engage the visitor, and CTA is the best way to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without Any Further ado, Let\u2019s Find out the Web Design Trends, To Watch Out For<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the nitty-gritty of why and what of web designing, we now come to the main and fun part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This last decade, the internet has changed, and websites have hanged with it. You won\u2019t see the designs of the website you used to see back in 2000. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today website designing is all about creativity. You don\u2019t have to use the same old constrictive grid designs, not set fonts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Websites are the new canvas, and web designers are the new artists of the block. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What should you and every other entrepreneur look out for? Here are a few web design examples-<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Vibrant Colors &amp; Gradients<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you remember the old Instagram icon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, the vintage instant camera one. Ever since they changed it into a prismatic gradient icon in 2016, the gradient style became dominant in online web designing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to catch the attention if the visitors is with bold colors and gradients, it\u2019s a proven fact. Choosing a beautifully bold color or gradient is going to make your website stand out. And the color can also make your brand pop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the color scheme of your website also matches your business logo, the visitor instantly connects the color to your brand. Case in point, the automated texting and email website <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/skipio.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skipio<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

They are done with the content that is bent on selling rather than serving. So UX writing is coming to the fore with relevant content that is going to let the visitor experience the web on their own, seamlessly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t have a lot of scopes to talk about your business and its goals on your webpage, without making it look too much. With proper UX writing, you can make the visitors engage with your website more and possibly convert them to loyal clients. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Websites like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.studioforum.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studioforum<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are applying UX writing in a perfect way.

You have a screen that is split into two halves. Both halves would have a different design element or color, making them stand out and clash with each other, but in a good way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The split screen is great for mobile browser users, as the side by side screens are turned into vertical pages when accessed from a smartphone browser. Many designers are heading towards an asymmetrical approach, with the screens divided in an unequal way. Take, for example, the website of <\/span>Bose headphones<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9186 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-special-bose-eu-en-2019-04-17-17_06_25-1.png\" alt=\"web design trends 2019 bose headphone\" width=\"1366\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-special-bose-eu-en-2019-04-17-17_06_25-1.png 1366w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-special-bose-eu-en-2019-04-17-17_06_25-1-300x146.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-special-bose-eu-en-2019-04-17-17_06_25-1-768x375.png 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-special-bose-eu-en-2019-04-17-17_06_25-1-1024x500.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The asymmetrical approach gives the designer a hierarchy of design, letting them highlight the element that is important. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also go for traditional equal division of the page like the website for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/theoceanfortlauderdale.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ocean Resort Residence<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9187 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-theoceanfortlauderdale-2019-04-17-17_04_34-1.png\" alt=\"web design trends 2019 Ocean\" width=\"1366\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-theoceanfortlauderdale-2019-04-17-17_04_34-1.png 1366w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-theoceanfortlauderdale-2019-04-17-17_04_34-1-300x146.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-theoceanfortlauderdale-2019-04-17-17_04_34-1-768x375.png 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-theoceanfortlauderdale-2019-04-17-17_04_34-1-1024x500.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With their equal division and use of different colors, it looks striking and beautiful. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12.

Micro-interactions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best and subtle way of involving the website visitor is through micro-interactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This specific trend has been around the block for a long time, but now they are being reinvented in a new way. Previously by micro-interactions web designers meant the red dot that indicated a message you received, or a sound effect when you performed an action on the webpage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But today micro-interactions are more inviting. Scroll and hover animations, sound effects are going to become more featured on the websites. This is going to make them more inviting and fun to engage with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/femmeandfierce.nl\/home\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Femme &amp; Fierce<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> applies this feature of micro-Interaction in a unique way making sure that the visitors have fun while they are on the website.

Natural Organic Shapes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gone are the days of systematic grids and boxy designs. The world of web designing is going to be dominated by natural and organic shapes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The geometric shapes of squares and triangles with their precise shapes and corners give a sense of stability. But today people want a sense of comfort. Which is why designers are leaning more towards natural lines and organic shapes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take for example the official website for Babytalk for Dads initiative by UNICEF.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9193 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-babytalkfordads-org-2019-04-17-18_25_14-1.png\" alt=\"web design trends 2019 baby talk for dads\" width=\"1366\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-babytalkfordads-org-2019-04-17-18_25_14-1.png 1366w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-babytalkfordads-org-2019-04-17-18_25_14-1-300x146.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-babytalkfordads-org-2019-04-17-18_25_14-1-768x375.png 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-babytalkfordads-org-2019-04-17-18_25_14-1-1024x500.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The very first page is enough to give the visitor a sense of familiarity and comfort.

A Mix Of Horizontal And Vertical Texts<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To shake things up a little, web designers are now applying a healthy mix of horizontal and vertical text while designing websites. This breaks the monotony of the normal block of texts and makes it look interesting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s an easy way of turning the heads of the website visitors and creating whitespace, giving your content some breathing room. This non-traditional aesthetic is going to make it big.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9196 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/MPVP-min-1.gif\" alt=\"web design trends 2019\" width=\"1347\" height=\"647\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take for example the website of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Magic People Voodoo People<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The creative agency has adopted the horizontal and vertical text layout. This gives their website a nice and unique flare and matches their aesthetic as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">19. Black And White Element<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The color may be making its way to the top, but black &amp; white are not far behind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is nothing more effective than black and white design to make a statement. Strip your website of color and the visitor will solely focus on the content. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bright colors and gradients will sit side by side with the black and white aesthetic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you look at a black &amp; white website like the website for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elite Paris<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you\u2019ll see that by the color from the homepage completely, they have made a bold statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9197 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-elitemodel-fr-fr-web-app-2019-04-18-11_14_19-1.png\" alt=\"web design trends 2019 Elite Paris\" width=\"1366\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-elitemodel-fr-fr-web-app-2019-04-18-11_14_19-1.png 1366w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-elitemodel-fr-fr-web-app-2019-04-18-11_14_19-1-300x146.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-elitemodel-fr-fr-web-app-2019-04-18-11_14_19-1-768x375.png 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/screencapture-elitemodel-fr-fr-web-app-2019-04-18-11_14_19-1-1024x500.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The visitor is going to focus more on the faces displayed and what they represent. The minimalistic approach mixed with the black &amp; white design is eye-catching and beautiful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The temptation to make your website colorful and vivid is going to be strong.

So it makes perfect sense to have a video background on your homepage that will show them in brief, the goal of your website. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website for <\/span>Brave People Co.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a digital creative agency, uses this feature perfectly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initial caption \u201cAn Agency for the Detailed\u201d along with the background video of small detail oriented scenes sets the mood for the website and makes it look better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, having video content can also slow your website down.

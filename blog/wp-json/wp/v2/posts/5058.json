Now deploying applications faster across all kinds of platforms starting from mobile to desktops and tablets will become easier. With AngularJS2 &#8211; the upgraded version of AngularJS, this JavaScript framework has now gone a step ahead with improved features, which is specially suited for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/web-app-development\/\">web app development<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Simplifying a developer\u2019s task\u00a0<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A developer can now independently use third party library; at the same time can also write their own codes. Command line interface along with Angular CLI command, improved router with core APIs are some of the strongest features, which make it the best framework for developers. With more fixed bugs and resolved issues, there is no doubt that this latest version will make the task of a developer less cumbersome.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many other significant improvements in web app development have come to the fore with this release. For instance: the introduction of web workers to simplify web content thus enabling them to run scripts even in backgrounds, the inclusion of more languages to facilitate server-side rendering of apps and many more. Along with this, payload size increase is yet another noteworthy feature.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Six years ago, AngularJS\u2019 introduction for the first time mainly constituted of HTML-based development and dependency injection. These two came into usage for the first time then. Decoupling of the framework from DOM was the primary purpose for which the framework came into usage. Moreover, multiple renderers were also enabled along with Microsoft\u2019s TypeScript.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, from the early stages of web app development to this day, AngularJS has graduated from an amateur framework to a client side MVW framework. Making complicated single page applications easier is the primary purpose of the framework and it does with complete expertise. The USP of the framework is that it places equal importance on testing the application as well as writing it. As a result, it leads to a simpler development process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before getting into any discussion further, let us first understand the need for AngularJS2. To address issues in mobile such as performance and load time, to remove different modules from Angular\u2019s core and to enable the developers to focus on implementing the code. However, many developers have raised concerns regarding the compatibility of this latest framework; however, there won\u2019t be any problem with the robust features of the framework.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Changes And Updates<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A slew of changes with improved functionalities and capabilities comes in AngularJS2. \u00a0AtScript is the latest addition in this version . It has a Traceur compiler, which produces ES5 code. The developer does this with the help of TypeScript\u2019s syntax. The syntax generates runtime type assertions by compiling time checks. On the other hand, you can still use JavaScript code and use it to write the codes for AngularJS based apps.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now it\u2019s time to take a look at the latest and additional features of AngularJS2.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Stronger Dependency Injection<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the launch of AngularJS, dependency injection helped it to stand out from various other JavaScript frameworks. Modular development along with component isolation is a major update. The latest version aims to solve all the problems, which were not solved in the previous versions. Moreover, many child injectors have addressed the issues still prevailing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Improved Annotations With Injectors<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">AtScript comes with tools for connecting metadata with other functions. It creates object instances after sending the required information to DI library. Once sent, it checks for any other metadata during a function call. Developers can inject an annotation to override the parameter data. Use child injectors to increase the capability of its parent over the child level. One can call different kinds of objects with various annotations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Data Binding With Templates<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do you know that data binding and templates go hand in hand when it comes to overall web app development? With the \u2018dynamic loading\u2019 feature, developers can add directives. At the same time, they can also include controllers. The role of templating goes beyond binding. It loads the dependencies only by referencing the component definition.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>New Directives<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is one of the latest features of AngularJS2. Three new directives \u2013 Component, Decorator and Template Directives drive this. Component Directives makes use of reusable components by including logic in the JavaScript and CSS style sheet. Decorator Directives, on the other hand, shows or hides elements with ng-show\/ng-hide. Template Directives, converts HTML to the reusable template.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Convenient Routing Solutions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are someone, who has used AngularJS previously, then you must know about its limited framework features. The recent version comes loaded with an array of features. Take a look below:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Location Service<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">404 Route Handling<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Document Title Updates<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Navigation Model (For Generating a Navigation UI)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Query String Support<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Simple JSON-based Route Config<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">URL Resolver<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Static, Parameterized and Splat Route Patterns<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Child Router<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The primary function of a child router is to transform all the components of an application into smaller one with the help of a router. It mainly constitutes of two things \u2013 screen activator and design. While screen activator helps to smoothen the navigation lifecycle with a set of callbacks; on the other hand, the design makes it incredibly easier to add steps in the timeline. In order to make a server request, it is necessary to authenticate the user data. In addition to this, the asynchronous nature enables developers to make a good server request.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Logging<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having a good library allows the pluggable modules to create logs without any stack trace. Even when you are working with an object oriented language like JavaScript. It allows a developer to follow the source code by analyzing the diary.js. One can expect that in future, more modifications are going to take place in this framework.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There has been a lot of buzz in the technology world related to the release of AngularJS2. With its robust features, it will surely make the process of web app development much easier.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google has finally developed an optimized framework to increase the size and performance of a web application.

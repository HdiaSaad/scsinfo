You never know if the instructor you hired would be the proper fit for you or not.

So it is important for your app to be able to connect with the wearable device and sync the data accordingly. This way the user can have seamless access to all their fitness data both on their wearable and their phone.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>4. Activity Tracking\u00a0&amp; Activity Log- Track The Activity Easily<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Any fitness app has the feature of tracking user activity and keeping a proper log. The activity the fitness app will be tracking are walking, running, cycling, and swimming. Through this activity tracking feature, the app keeps a \u00a0log of health and fitness stats of the user, such as how many calories burned, how many steps taken and miles run. Along with this you can create your own workout plan app, or add this feature to the activity tracking app to make it easy for users to plan their work out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This feature can be used in both ways, with a Fitbit, and with a smartphone sensor.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5. Geolocation &#8211; Locating The Fitness<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The geolocation feature is important for a fitness app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly it helps the user to track their walking and running route. This way they can keep a track of how many miles they have walked or run, and how many calories they have burned with that.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, because it adds another layer of personalization to the app. With the geolocation feature, the users can get fitness tips based on their continent, country, weather, etc. because of course, the fitness regime for someone living in MAis not going to be similar to someone living in China. Which is why to make your fitness app even more personalized, make sure to integrate geolocation feature to your app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>6. Notification &#8211; Notify When The Fitness Is Almost Achieved<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Don\u2019t we all love to be reminded that we were supposed to work out but we forgot?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, maybe we don\u2019t. But the push notification is still a great feature for the fitness app you want to make. The notifications can give the users useful details and reminders such as workout routine reminder, new ideas about exercising, how many calories they have burned, etc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But do give the users option to mute the notifications. Not all users are going to want to receive notifications all the time. So give them options to change the notification settings if they have to.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>7. Target Setting &#8211; To Complete The Fitness Goal<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With this feature, you can give the users a chance to set up daily, weekly and monthly fitness goals.

With this, the app will set the targets for the user itself. Based on the information entered by the user. This way they will not set up impractical goals and lose motivation midway and stop using the app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>8. Workout Tips &#8211; Helping The User To Get In Shape<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With this, you can give the users small fitness tips and tricks to keep them constantly motivated. These small workout tips can help them to get fit faster, something we all dream of.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>9.

And to do so, you have to integrate the food logging feature into your diet and nutrition app. With this food logging app, the users can enter the information of what they had for meals throughout the day and they can see how many calories they have consumed. This way they can have firm control over the calorie intake.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Calorie Calculator<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A person can already have a meal, and then log what they have eaten, only to see that they consumed more calories than they should have. Which is why you need to have the calorie calculator feature in your app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The user would be able to calculate the calories of the food they are going to eat and plan in advance what they are going to have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Dieting Tips And Recipes<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A dieting app is not complete without dieting tips.

They can plan meals and get suggestions on what groceries they would need for that meal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Workout App Special Feature<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The workout app is for the hardcore fitness maniacs out there. These are the people who have made fitness their religion. So it is obvious that an app designed for them would have to have some specialized features.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_10113\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10113\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10113 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/create-personalized-workout-app-.jpg\" alt=\"health and fitness app development\" width=\"1024\" height=\"525\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10113\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: apps.apple<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Below are the special features you need to build a workout timer app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Wearable Device Integration<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We have mentioned this feature before, but when it comes to the workout apps, it is worth mentioning again. The wearable device integration is absolutely important for the workout app because it is the best way to track the progress of an exercise routine. The user can track their heart rate, calories burned, goal progress, etc. with the wearable device integration, you can make it convenient for the users to use your app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Chat And Consult Trainer<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of time, a workout app is not enough. This is why you need to give the users an option to connect and chat with personal trainers near them. By having this network of gym specialists and personal trainers, you will give the users access to better exercise and training experience. Along with this, you can add the workout checklist app feature to it where the user can make their own workout checklist to follow.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Activity Log<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The user must be able to log their activity during exercise sessions. This way they have a way of tracking their progress throughout time. Along with that, you should also have the fitness interval timer app feature, so that users can time their exercises. Your app needs to be the best fitness log app to give the users a perfect user experience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Exercise Videos And Tutorials<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The exercise videos and tutorials are an amazing feature to add when you create your own HIIT workout app. With this, you can give the newbies a chance to learn different exercises in a free, affordable and hassle-free way.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Mental Health App Special Feature<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The fitness of the body is not enough. To be truly fit, one needs mental fitness as well. And that is where the mental health apps come in. the health fitness apps are made to make users fit from both outside and inside, and they are really important when you develop your own android app or iOS app for fitness.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_10114\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10114\" style=\"width: 999px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10114 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/create-meditation-app.jpg\" alt=\"health and fitness app development\" width=\"999\" height=\"503\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10114\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: apps.apple<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you are thinking about making a mental health app, then these are some of the specialized features you can add to it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Guided Meditation<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meditation is an important way of getting the mind in a healthy place. So it is obvious that your app needs to have a meditation feature. But at the same time, not everyone who is going to use your app is going to know how to meditate. So you need a guided meditation feature for the app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The guided meditation feature is not only going to help the user learn how to meditate but also teach them breathing exercises, mindfulness and train their mind to stay calm even in the worst of all situations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Short Meditation Session<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this fast-paced everyday life, no one has time to sit down for an hour or so, meditating for the mind\u2019s peach.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Which is why you need to integrate the feature of short meditation sessions. These short sessions, lasting only 5-10 minutes, will be a quick meditation point for the users. It is going to be incredibly helpful and useful to the users.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Collection Of Soothing Ambient Sounds And Music<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With the collection of soothing ambient music and sounds, the users can feel calm and focused wherever they are. You can include sounds like nature sounds like a waterfall, trees rustling in the wind, chirping of birds and many more. This feature can help the users focus, and give them peace and sleep.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Offline Download Of Meditation Sessions And Music Collection<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With the offline download feature, the user can take their meditation sessions anywhere. It is not possible to have an internet connection all the time, even at this age. So make sure the guided meditation sessions can be downloaded for offline listening as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"step5\">5. Tech Stack &#8211; Let&#8217;s Get Technical<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you think about how to make a fitness app, you have to think about the technical side of it as well. After you have made the important decisions about what type of app you want to make and what kind of MVP and specialized features you need for your fitness apps, you need to focus on the tech stack.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to the functionality of a fitness application, the tech stack is incredibly important. In this case, we can study one of the celebrities of the fitness app segment- Fitbit, and see what kind of tech stack they have implemented in their app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>For application and data, they have used programming languages such as C, Java, Javascript, and HTML5.<\/li>\r\n<li>For dedicated cloud hosting, Fitbit uses IBM SoftLayer, which is a public cloud computing platform.<\/li>\r\n<li>And for the framework of the app, they use the Android SDK and Spring Framework.<\/li>\r\n<li>For the API, Fitbit uses Runscope. It is a cloud-based and hybrid on-premise solution for the developers to test and debug the application APIs. In order to provide seamless user experience, Fitbit uses Fastly for its Content Delivery Network.<\/li>\r\n<li>For code collaboration, Fitbit developers have used Github, and for performance monitoring New Relic. Along with these, they have used <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pingdom.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pingdom <\/a>for website monitoring and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pagerduty.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">PagerDuty <\/a>for monitoring aggregation.<\/li>\r\n<li>For issue tracking the developers have user JIRA and for project management Confluence. For group chat purpose, they have used HipChat and for help desk, the developers have integrated the use of Desk.com.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"step6\">6. Monetization &amp; Fitness Apps: How Will You Make Money?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So you have found out all about how to create a fitness app. But did you find out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/proven-mobile-app-monetization-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\">how to make money with your app?<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you have dived into the world of fitness and health app development, you need to learn about the monetization strategies that go with it. So let\u2019s see how you are going to make money with it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Show The Right Ads<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ads are the universal way of making money with apps. And it fits your health and fitness app development as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s the simplest and most common way you can make money with your fitness app. Make the app free and monetize it with the right ads for your app. But there is a word of caution here!<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ads tend to annoy people, most of the time. So don\u2019t overdo it with the ads throughout the app. They should be displayed in an organized way, and not pop up randomly while the user is going through that intense bit of workout.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Also, when you make your own fitness app, make sure to integrate ads that are relevant to health and fitness app development. These ads should be about sportswear and nutritional foods etc. just make sure you don\u2019t lose users because of ads.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>A One Time Fee, Or Make It Monthly<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Subscriptions are the second universal way of making money with apps.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you make a fitness app for your business, you can integrate multiple subscription plans to make money from the users. The basic subscription plans can be a monthly or yearly basis, which means the users would have to pay a monthly fee every month to use special features on the fitness app or pay a fee once every year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The other plans can be a quarterly fee paid every three months. Including multiple subscription plans will make sure that the users can subscribe to it using a convenient plan for them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The Paid Features<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you develop a fitness app, you can have the feature of paid features into your app. It can be anything from personalized training sessions or in-app chatting with personal trainers or getting regular workout tips from the different fitness enthusiasts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/top-app-monetization-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"981\" height=\"227\" class=\"wp-image-9659\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/app-monetization-ideas.png\" alt=\"health and fitness app development monetization ideas\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The fun part is that mobile fitness app developers can combine this monetization model with others as well for maximum monetization possibility.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Get Sponsorships For Your App<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The sponsorship for your fitness app monetization can work in two ways.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, you can get sponsors who will pay you so that whenever the users of your app want to buy something or want any external service, you direct them to the sponsor\u2019s platform.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, you can promote any kind of fitness related products, and get paid a fee when the app user makes a purchase of the promoted product based on your app\u2019s advice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Sponsorships are an amazing way of monetizing your fitness app. Because not only you are going to make money with it, but you are also going to get the exposer you need to increase your userbase.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So now let\u2019s take a look at the more popular fitness apps in the market that are going to be your potential competitors as you create your workout app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"step7\">7. Choose The Right Fitness App Development Partner<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you have found out almost everything about the fitness app, it\u2019s time to figure out how you are going to pick the right partner for your app development process. Chances are that you yourself are not very familiar with the extremely technical side of the app development process such as coding and design and whatnot. And even if you are, you will still need help to create a robust fitness app.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So how are you going to pick the right partner for the development process? Here are a few criteria.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Work Portfolio<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The first and foremost thing to check out when choosing the right health and fitness app developer as your development partner is to check out their work portfolio. This way you would get a glimpse at the kind of work they have already done and if it is relevant to your project. Once you have an idea of their capabilities it will be easier for you to make the decision.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Client References<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Client references are a big thing when it comes to choosing the right fitness app development partner. If they have already done works related to fitness apps, then the client references can help you understand whether they can do a competent job or not. Not just that, client references and reviews stand as a testimony to the skills and expertise of the app developer.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Will They Add Value To Your App?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>App development is not a blind job. The developer has to add value to your app as well, a value that might not have been there when you first started planning the app. The skills and expertise of the developer are going to add unique value to your app that is going to make it unique. So before you pick your app development partner for your fitness and health app, make sure that they will add unique value to your app.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Technical Skills Of The Developer Team<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since fitness apps themselves can be quite technical to develop, choosing a team that is skilled in the technical aspects of app development is going to be better for your app. Here you can once again fall back onto client reviews and see what is being said about the potential team\u2019s technical skills.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It may take more than this to choose the right partner for your health and fitness app development. But at the end of the day, the above-mentioned factors are the most important in choosing the right app development partner for your app. So, what&#8217;s your take?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Bottomline<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A fit person leads a better life. This is the motto for people everywhere today. And keeping up with this value, the fitness app sector is getting more and more popular every day.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Which is why this is the perfect time for you to think about how to make a fitness app, and enter the market with your unique idea.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"981\" height=\"227\" class=\"wp-image-9656\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/app-development-cost-lazy-man-guide.png\" alt=\"health and fitness tracker app development cost\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Before that, have a whiteboard session with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/mobile-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\">app development partner<\/a> and figure out the fitness app development cost.

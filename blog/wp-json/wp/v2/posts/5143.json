Most of the social media big players are offering some kind of eCommerce integration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see that Twitter is launching product pages.

Chatbots\u00a0&#8211; The Ultimate Shopping Guide For Your Customer<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We already mentioned the role of Artificial Intelligence in the eCommerce business. Now, one of its successful implementations is chatbots. The successful implementation of chatbots makes your eCommerce business way smarter than your competitors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10200\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/chatbot.jpg\" alt=\"chatbot\" width=\"626\" height=\"626\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chatbots not only save time but also provide automated and fast answers to customers\u2019 queries. Instead of waiting days for an assistant to call, customers get instant answers. Bei it early morning or midnight, customers never have to wait for answers. It undoubtedly offers great customer satisfaction. Thus, your business\u2019s customer service reaches a new height!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, integrating chatbots in your <\/span><b>eCommerce trends 2019<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>-2020<\/strong> can save a lot of operational costs.

Conversion Optimization &#8211; Product Page Vs Home Page<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually, businesses have an obsession to design intriguing home pages. However, especially for eCommerce websites, putting a bit more emphasis on the internal pages can do wonders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason is quite simple. The homepage is more often seen by repeated visitors. Either they search your brand name in Google. Or they go directly to your website. The new visitors tend to land on internal service or product pages more frequently. Also, this is probably their first interaction with your brand. Hence, an impressive internal page design may turn your new visitors into regular customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put yourself in the customers&#8217; shoes. And design the product pages in the way your first-time visitors want to see it. A stellar first impression is crucial for increasing the conversion rate. Hence, put more efforts to optimize your internal product page designs. Thus, this is definitely going to be a major part of the <\/span><b>eCommerce web design trends 2019<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; 2020.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9.

Especially for eCommerce businesses, it is crucial to attracting prospective customers. And ultimately turning them into paying customers. Just like a brick and mortar store, the designs and layouts of an online store play a game-changing role here. It can be the difference between turning a prospect into a potential customer. Or bouncing away in favor of a competitor!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital experience can dictate the entire experience a customer has with a business. So, you can afford to get left behind.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A. Mobile Era<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A huge percentage of online shoppers prefer using mobiles to shop. So, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">designers have to create e-commerce websites for mobile-first. And then only adapt to larger screens. In the coming years, we will see more mobile-friendly features. Card-like layouts, finger-friendly icons, and long scrolling pages will be seen on most of the eCommerce website themes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B. Thumb Navigation for Mobile<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As continued from the above point, the next eCommerce web design trend is obvious! Statistics show that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">94% of smartphone users hold their devices vertically<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Hence, to facilitate thumb use, positioning the navigation buttons at the screen bottom will be a good practice.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C. Striking Colors<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, the use of white space and minimalistic design are already trending in the market. However, this year, we are probably going to see the experimental use of striking and bold colors in eCommerce web design trends 2019-2020. For eCommerce websites, the monochromatic design is not very appropriate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D. Vintage Photography<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reviving the vintage styles is one of the most trending eCommerce trends in recent days. In vintage photography, we can see the use of a muted color palette. This is reminiscent of the gritty, low-fi photography of the 70s. Also, colors are here imbued with more black than other modern styles. It heightens that dated look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, other than all these, you have to make sure your eCommerce site design implements the following points.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Micro-interactions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More and more video content<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contextual logos<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Storytelling approach, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wrapping Up<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no doubt that technology is evolving at a rapid pace. It is a great catalyst for both diversification and expansion of the eCommerce industry. So, implementing the ongoing technological trends in your online store can assure success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the eCommerce trends mentioned in this blog were derived from the success they have brought to many eCommerce sites.

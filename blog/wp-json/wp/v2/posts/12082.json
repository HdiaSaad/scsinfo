But before we get to that, we need to talk about why you should create marketplace with Magento.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Reasons Why You Should Choose Open-source Magento?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many industry specialists will prefer developing an eCommerce platform from scratch, for startups it can be very problematic. This method not only costs more but it also takes up a lot of time and effort. For a startup with a limited budget, this can harm the business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing <a href=\"https:\/\/magento.com\/products\/magento-open-source\">open-source Magento<\/a>, on the other hand, will save a lot of development time as well as save budget. There are, however, a few more reasons for choosing Magento.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a. Responsive Development<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Magento is a platform specifically created to develop a mobile responsive eCommerce marketplace. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.designrush.com\/agency\/magento\/new-york\/new-york-city\"><b>Top Casablanca Magento Development Agencies<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ensured that<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> any kind of marketplace created using this platform is accessible through all types of devices. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\">Related Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/agile-software-development-process\/\">Our Agile Software Development Process \u2013 How We Do It<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b. A Versatile Content Management System<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Magento, the shop owners are able to use the visual page editors to edit their product pages easily without any fuss. Even those who are less talented with coding are easily able to optimize the interface to be a user-friendly one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c. Building A Spacious And Powerful Ecommerce Marketplace<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/growthhackers.com\/articles\/benefits-of-magento-as-marketplace-solution\">A Magento 2 marketplace website is capable of supporting up to 500,000 products and handles about 80,000 products<\/a> every hour. This powerful and spacious quality of the marketplace websites makes it ready for future growth. However, the complexity of the size and the website creates special hosting needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">d. Browsing Related Products Easily<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is easy to add the feature of browsing related products with Magento. This does not only enhances the UX but also improves sales.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e. Third-party Integrations Made Easy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Magento makes it easy for developers to integrate third-party tools such as Paypal, Mailchimp, etc. It also allows for third-party tools integration for website data analysis. Hence it is easy if you create marketplace with Magento.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">f. Customizable Security Options<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/ecommerce-website-development\/\">When developing eCommerce websites<\/a> using Magento, the developers can customize the security of their eCommerce websites. Adding multiple levels of security using Magento is easy. The marketplace building platform comes with standard PCI data security, captcha enabled login screens, and for additional security a secondary password prompt. Magento also makes vendor management easy, for a secure shopping environment for the customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">g. Support Of A Huge Community<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no doubt that a huge community is already using Magento to create and maintain the marketplace website. You can find Magento developers spread worldwide, capable of creating an amazing eCommerce website, all thanks to the support of the huge community.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. A Quick Look At Magento Architecture<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Magento architecture is a mix between the Zend framework and the MVC architecture. This combination offers users unlimited control and flexibility.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since it is based on the Zend framework, the codebase is not only secure but scalable as well. Zend Framework comes with an object-oriented library of codes that provide better support for the developers. The code used to build Magento has three specific quality to it-<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a. Flexibility<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a marketplace with Magento ensures that the customization of the platform remains smooth. The code used to develop Magento is quite flexible and easy to modify, making the platform easy to scale in the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b. Scalability<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as Magento\u2019s code can be customized, it still remains upgradeable, which means that using Magento for eCommerce marketplace development will make sure that the website can be upgraded as the business grows.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\">Bonus: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/ecommerce-website-development\/\">Know our secret to help you boost online store engagement &amp; increase brand exposure!<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c. Speed and security<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Magento code is the top of the market when it comes to speed and security. The developers applied best practices to increase the flow and efficiency of the website and the online store.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Application And Modification Of The MVC Architecture<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Magento architecture does follow the MVC pattern, it also adds some of its own modifications to it as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A simple MVC structure divides up the codes into three parts- Model ( the main application), View (the reusable objects on the interface used by the Controller to perform tasks) and Controller ( how the model is presented to the user)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Controller is asked to perform a task, it employes Model to process data and puts forth the results using the view.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Magento, on the other hand, has added some additional sun-blocks to the traditional MVC structure. This modification helps Magento to support bigger eCommerce marketplace systems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we can see from the image above, the Model in Magento\u2019s MVC structure is divided into two parts and the View is divided into three structures. The helpers are in this case module-specific. This doesn\u2019t only help the developers to manage a complex eCommerce system, but also helps the website to grow with the business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Marketplace Types<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we start talking about the development and features, you need to choose what type of marketplace you want to build.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to Magento marketplace development, there are two types you can go with. The first is a single vendor marketplace and the second is multi-vendor marketplaces.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a. Single Vendor Marketplace<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The single vendor marketplaces usually represent a website where a single company, sells its products. This can be either a B2B marketplace built using Magento or a simple B2C eCommerce website.\u00a0 In this scenario, there are only two parties involved, the buyers and the sellers. These stand-alone websites will be perfect for you if you have a business that makes a specific brand of products and wants to sell that one particular website, avoiding competition.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b. Multi-Vendor Marketplace<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multi-vendor marketplaces such as Amazon, or eBay have a number of vendors selling various products on one platform. In the case of a multi-vendor platform, we have three kinds of users, system admin, vendor, and the end-user or customer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_12091\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12091\" style=\"width: 920px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-12091 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/MP-Multi-Vendor-M2_1_.png\" alt=\"create marketplace with magento for multi vendor \" width=\"920\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/MP-Multi-Vendor-M2_1_.png 920w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/MP-Multi-Vendor-M2_1_-300x228.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/MP-Multi-Vendor-M2_1_-768x584.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-12091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: ommunity.magento.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vendor sells products through its separate panels. The admin panel is used to manage the vendor and customer activity on the platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we know about the different kinds of market place types you can create using Magento, it\u2019s time to see what kinds of features you will need for both kinds of marketplace apps.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.

It needs zero investment, which is why it has become quite popular among eCommerce startups.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Magento Enterprise Edition or Magento Commerce is the paid version perfect for big and medium marketplace development. So which one to choose? Which one will be perfect for you? Let\u2019s find out. Here are some major comparisons between the two editions to understand which one you will need for your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security Requirements<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need a robust security system backing your eCommerce website, then choosing the Magento Enterprise solution would be a better idea for you. When it comes to security, the enterprise edition is far ahead of the free edition.

And if you are still in need of better functionalities, then you can just add the third party Magento marketplace extensions to your website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, if your website happens to be a bigger one with numerous resources and handling a lot of orders and traffic, choosing the Magento Enterprise edition would be a better decision. With the enterprise edition, you will get many additional features such as deploying your software through the Enterprise cloud to increase the deployment speed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scope For Future Growth<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you make the choice, you have to consider the business requirements for the future. If you want to grow your eCommerce platform in the future and offer a number of products from more than one vendor, then you should definitely choose the Enterprise edition. It is built to be scalable and support the future growth of the business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Difference Between Functionality<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There isn\u2019t much difference between the Community and the enterprise edition. Both these versions offer the same functionalities such as RMA functionality, Customer segmentation, content staging, Advanced ACL and many more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only difference, however, is the fact that with enterprise version you get access to additional features. So if you want to take advantage of the additional functionalities of the enterprise version, then you should choose the Magento Enterprise version.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Which One Should You Choose to Create Marketplace With Magento?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer to the question is pretty simple.

It\u2019s affordable and easy to integrate, therefore perfect for a brand new small startup.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, if you are starting out a new business and plan on expanding it, even more, investing in the enterprise version will be a better idea. The additional features of this version will make it easy for your business to scale in the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The development of modern eCommerce marketplace websites has certainly become popular and profitable.

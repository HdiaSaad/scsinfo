You can talk to your app development partner about app-specific features.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Finalize_the_different_sides_of_your_application\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Different Sides of The Healthcare\/Medical App<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every app has at least two sides of it, the admin panel, and the user app. The same applies to your healthcare application. To make a functional medicine health application you have to develop an admin panel and a user app.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a. The Admin Panel<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The admin panel is like the brain of the application. Admin panel is used to manage every aspect of the application, from managing the list of doctors to the appointments booked on the application.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without the admin panel, you won\u2019t be able to completely manage the functionalities of the application. It is the web-based application that\u2019ll help the authorized personnel to have control over the app and its functionalities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b. The User App<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The user application is the business end of the application. This is the part that will be used by healthcare professionals. During development, make sure that the app includes necessary features for the user.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is incredibly important for the user app to be well designed and developed.

Designing a Medical App: The Things to Consider<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Designing mobile medical apps is a different thing altogether. Medical applications created for industry professionals need to follow some basic principles, which are-<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a. The Principle Of Simplicity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since it is designed mainly for the treatment of patients, medical applications need to have a simple, intuitive design. A healthcare application does not need any extra flashy design elements, added embellishments and effects. During the design process make sure there are no excess elements to the app. Create a straightforward design that helps the users to make the best of it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b. The Principle Of Sensible Colors<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is best to choose sensible colors when designing a healthcare app. Most successful medical applications use sober colors in their designs. You should also consider the age group of the target audience. Choosing the right color palette helps you a lot in user retention. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c. The Principle Of Readability<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enhancing readability should be important for your medical app&#8217;s design. Using fancy fonts looks good, but makes the app hard to use. So choose an easy-to-read font style, and don\u2019t use more than two styles in the app<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">d. The Principle Of Responsive Design<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responsive design for mobile applications is a given these days, thanks to the wide range of devices being used by industry professionals these days. So make sure that the app is designed to fit any screen the user might be using.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"All_the_necessary_features\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.

Complying With Legal Regulations &#8211; Check Out The Country Rules<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many security regulations you should consider before launching a healthcare application. The architecture of the application needs to be designed properly. And it must meet all the security and privacy regulations set by the governmental bodies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The security and privacy regulations tend to vary with the different regions in the world. Make sure that the app follows the laws of different regions before launching. Here are some regulatory laws set by governmental bodies all around the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USA<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To launch a medical application for the USA market that transmits Protected Health Information (PHI) of a patient must be in compliance with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This act regulated how protected health information is sent back and forth between the servers and forces limitations on the access to individually identifiable healthcare information to the unauthorized personnel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your application will fall under <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jotform.com\/what-is-hipaa-compliance\/\">HIPAA compliance<\/a> if it contains PHI and it is shared by the covered organizations like hospitals. Any healthcare apps that don&#8217;t contain PHI falls under the Non-HIPAA category.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada sets out the parameters for the use of personal data through the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/laws-lois.justice.gc.ca\/eng\/acts\/P-8.6\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The act sets out privacy rules for the use of personal information for businesses, including medical apps. The Canadian government uses this act to regulate the use of personal data by businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">European Union<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are looking to launch your medical app in Europe, you have to make sure that your app complies with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gdpr-info.eu\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General Data Protection Regulation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in effect since 2018 May. GDPR specifies how businesses can treat personal data and how they should protect it. The regulation applies to all EU citizens. Collecting and using medical data of the EU citizens makes the application subject of GDPR regulation. Under GDPR any data identifying username, password, photos, health records, etc are considered as personal data.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UK<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the UK you have to follow the Data Protection Act for patient care apps. It regulates and sets out the limits on the usage and storage of personal information. According to the law, the uses should be detailed in the privacy policy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asian regions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data privacy laws vary greatly all over the Asia Pacific region. And to launch your mobile applications for the health sector you have to become familiar with them. The data protection laws change over time in this region. It seems to take a similar shape to the General Data Protection Regulation in use in the EU.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of all the variations, two laws stand out. Japan\u2019s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), dating back to 2003, acts as the oldest law in this field. Singapore\u2019s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) is extremely strict. It has some of the toughest penalties for those who misuse personal information of the users.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Monetizing_your_app\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8.

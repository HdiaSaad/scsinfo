Why Should You Build An App?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do you want to create an app?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have a simple answer for this, \u201cbecause I have an idea for an app.\u201d But is that answer good enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before starting, you need to know that just because your idea sounds good theoretically, does not mean it is going to be awesome. It needs to have a value proposition for its users.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_9034\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9034\" style=\"width: 635px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9034\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/value-proposition-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"how to make an app with value\" width=\"635\" height=\"423\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: https:\/\/bradchattergoon.com\/what-is-value-b9df225f7d08<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So before you really get into it, look at the idea and then look at it again. Analyze the idea and find out why this project is really needed out there. What problem is it going to solve? How is it going to help the people out there<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also need to look at the logistics side of the idea. How is the idea going to be translated into the application? How will it make you money? Only after you\u2019ve done a complete evaluation of your idea should you go ahead with your idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--\n\n\n<h3><strong>Related Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/mobile-app-development-company-5-proven-reasons-why-customers-are-not-using-your-app\/\" target=\"_blank\">5 Reasons Why Users Might Discard Your App!<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n--><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Related Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/mobile-app-development-company-5-proven-reasons-why-customers-are-not-using-your-app\/\" target=\"_blank\">5 Reasons Why Users Might Discard Your App!<\/a><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t just listen to those who say \u201cwow, the idea is great, you should make an app for that!!\u201d do your own research first. See if your app is absolutely needed out there. Because if it isn\u2019t you are only going to waste your money by investing in it. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Understanding_your_Target_Audience\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Who Is Your Target Audience? Have You Made A List?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every answer related to how to build an app online has the topic of target audience related to it. So who is the target audience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who are going to use your app?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding your target audience before you start building your app is one of the most important steps. This will help you understand what features you need in your app. It will also help you to choose a platform? Based on that you can ask the following questions<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/ios-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make an app for iPhone<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Or, how to make an app for Android?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you are building an e-commerce app for a makeup company, your target audience is going to be mostly women. Knowing this, it will be easier for you to optimize your app according to their need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding the target audience is also important for figuring out what kind of monetization model you need to choose. Knowing your target audience means also knowing how they are going to pay and how you can generate revenue from them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In brief, knowing your target audience means knowing how to build an app that everyone loves.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Research_your_market_competition\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Why Do You Need To Research Your Competition?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today no idea is unique.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just when you are thinking \u201cI have an idea for an app\u201d, someone somewhere is probably developing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how to make your app unique?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer to the question, how to build an app that is unique is easy- you look into the competition in the market. See what they are doing, if you have to, use their app for a while. Do a complete and thorough analysis of what they are doing and how they are doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then think of how you can do it differently and more efficiently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The users out there don\u2019t need two same apps. So in order to really sell your app, you need to make it as unique as possible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to understand the pain points of the user, and analyze how your competition is solving that problem. And then figure out how you can solve that same problem in a better and unique way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Understanding_the_cost_structure_of_your_app\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. What Is Cost Structure And Why Should You Know About It?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing in this world is free, and the same thing is true for your app. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So just as you are thinking \u201cI have an idea for an app.\u201d you also need to think, \u201chow much is it going to cost to build the app?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building an app takes money. Whether you are going to hire the services of an experienced app development company, or doing it yourself with some of your buddies. The question you are probably asking is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how much is it going to cost to make your own app?<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That depends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a vague answer, but it is true. The cost of building your app depends on your idea. Below are the three factors on which the cost of building your app depends. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Functionality and Complexity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more complex your app is, the more money it will take to build.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Something<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> simple- like a to-do list app is going to cost less than a complex gaming app. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your idea may be simple, but you may also want your app to be full of simple little features. This will increase the cost of development. Even though today app developers are more efficient in delivering the project with a wide range of convenient features. It is still a better idea for you to go with MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for that first version of the app. You can add more features as you go on. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Device and Platform<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technical aspect of what kind of app you are building is going to affect the costing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, you have to decide whether you want a native app, which will be installed directly into an Android or an iOS device. Or you can choose to build a hybrid app, which runs directly on a device\u2019s browser, regardless of the operating system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9033 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/app-development-cost-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"how to make an app - the cost\" width=\"981\" height=\"242\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/app-development-cost-1-1.jpg 981w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/app-development-cost-1-1-300x74.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/app-development-cost-1-1-768x189.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever you decide, is going to play a major role in determining the development cost. App development for different platforms like Android and iOS takes a different amount of money. So choosing the device is important if you want to determine your app-building cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, you may want your app to be suitable for more than one platform. Building an app simultaneously for more than one platform is going to raise the cost of app building.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Deadline to Build An App<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When do you want the app?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The timeline or the deadline is going to be important in determining the cost of the app. \u00a0You may want the app in a few weeks or a few months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how is the timeline relevant to the app building cost?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The longer it takes in app building, the more money it will cost you. Which means that you should have the app built as soon as possible right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you rush through the development process, it is actually going to cost you more money in the long term. So how long should it really take?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to find a sweet spot between the timeline. Taking too long or too short a time is going to raise the cost of the app. If you rush the developer team, then not only will your app quality suffer, but you\u2019ll also have to pay the team rush charges to deliver the project in a short amount of time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So make sure to set a reasonable timeline for your app to be developed if you want to keep the cost reasonable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Going_for_a_business_model_to_make_the_app\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Do You Need A Business Model? Which One to Go For?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the business model? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are building an app startup, you need to implement a business model. This will help you to make money. But how are you going to make money with your business model?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of business models you can apply to monetize your apps. Some of the most popular ones are<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freemium<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is one of the most popular business models when it comes to monetizing your apps. With freemium, you are offering the user a limited version of your app. If they want full access, they would have to pay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is better than putting a price on your app from the get-go, because then people may not even give your app a chance. With the Freemium model, users can at least check out your app before deciding whether they want to keep using it or not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two ways you can make money with this technique, firstly through a subscription basis. And secondly, through a one-time payment basis. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With one-time payment basis, your users are going to pay once to get access to all the exclusive content on your app. And with monthly subscription technique is going to earn you a steady stream of revenue through monthly payments. <\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_9035\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9035\" style=\"width: 635px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9035\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/monetization-methods-1.png\" alt=\"how to make an app that makes money\" width=\"635\" height=\"317\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9035\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: https:\/\/sweetpricing.com\/blog\/2017\/01\/freemium-mobile-apps\/<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In-app Purchases<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With in-app purchases, you can give your users a chance to buy virtual goods. This model is widely used by various gaming apps, but apps such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/radishfiction.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radish fiction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has also implemented this technique. You can buy virtual coins on Radish fiction with which you can unlock new chapters of books. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid Apps<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the simplest ways of monetizing your idea, paid apps are very popular among app owners. By charging the users one time when they are downloading and installing the app, you can earn revenue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to get significant revenue this way, you have to have a wide base of the user, which can be a little problematic for the startups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/top-app-monetization-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9046\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-15-1.png\" alt=\"how to build an app and earn money\" width=\"981\" height=\"227\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-15-1.png 981w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-15-1-300x69.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-15-1-768x178.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Fixing_the_app_features_and_the_wireframes\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. What App Feature Do You Really Need? Are You Feeling Overwhelmed?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After looking at solutions for how to build an app, make a list of the features you want your app to have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before you even think about how to develop your own app with the maximum feature on the first version, STOP.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t try to aim for as many features as possible on the very first version. It is very unrealistic of you to want your app to have tons of feature on the first launch. Try to send out an MVP with essential features that are going to help you in getting more users and revenues. These features can be &#8211;<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Push notifications<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most efficient ways of building a connection with your users, push notifications are necessary for your app. Whether you have a reminder app or an e-commerce app, push notifications can reach out to your users, telling them about new features, updates, exclusive deals, etc. Push notifications can be used very efficiently to generate more revenues from users.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real-time sync<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a website, and an app based on it, it is necessary you have real-time sync on your app. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feature of auto syncing is going to sync all the user information over all platforms. Specifically important in e-commerce apps, the real-time sync feature makes sure that users have a similar experience throughout all the platforms. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security updates<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are going to be security problems with your apps whether you like it or not. Even the most famous social media <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalinformationworld.com\/2018\/10\/facebook-notified-30-million-users-information-hack.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook has gone through security breaches<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So it is quite possible that your app might go through that as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which is the reason why you absolutely have to have the feature of a security update from day one of app launch. Your app is obviously going to collect some user data to work. You need to make sure that these user data are safe and not used by anyone with malicious intent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making your app a safe place for your users are going to get your app more followers and users. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/mobile-app-security-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So figure out all the ways you can make your app secure<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Choosing_the_right_app_development_partner\">7. Choosing The Right Team To Build Your App<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you have the features picked out for your app, you need to pick the right team to build your app.<\/p>\n<p>If your company is a global multinational company then you probably have your own in-house development team. But if you are just a small startup, you have a choice to make.<\/p>\n<p>You can hire freelancers who would develop your app at a lower price. When you hire freelancers, you have fewer people to communicate with and the process moves faster.<\/p>\n<p>As for hiring an agency for the app building, it is a bit pricey, but the end result is going to be of good quality. App development agencies have more experience and more specialization. Along with that, when you hire an app development agency, they will work on several parts of the project simultaneously, like the wireframing and the pre-launch marketing strategy making can be done simultaneously, which means the project will go faster.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Fixing_the_App_development_platform_to_build\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. What Platform Should You Choose?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, we are back to the point of platforms- Android vs iOS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you found out How to make your app for iPhone? Or do you need to find all about how to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/android-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make an app for Android<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? To know the answer to this, you need to choose a platform first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently Android and iOS are dominating the global smartphone market. So which one should you choose and why does it matter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a developmental point of view, it is easier and less time consuming to develop an app for iOS when compared to Android. Android\u2019s open source project means that multiple manufacturers can make their own optimization to the OS and use it for their own smartphone brands. <\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_9039\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9039\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9039\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/android-vs-ios-app-development-1.jpg\" alt=\"how to make an app android vs ios\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9039\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: https:\/\/comtech2.com\/android-vs-ios-app-development-app-startups-focus-ios-first\/<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which is why there is a vast number of different Android phones in the market. And to make an Android app means to make it compatible with all of them. So it is going to take a lot of time to build your Android app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iOS is a closed system, owned and used by Apple on their own devices. So when you choose iOS as your platform, there is not really any worries about different devices and their compatibilities. Your app only needs to be compatible with Apple devices. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now you are probably thinking which platform is going to make you the most money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Android dominates the global market, it is <\/span><b>iOS apps that make more money<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The vast number of apps available for an Android user means they are more prone to find a free app than pay for one. iOS users, on the other hand, have no problem spending money over a quality app.<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as for the user count, Android definitely has more users than iOS, but when it comes to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smartphone user market in the US, and Europe, there are more iPhone users than Android users<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention, there is an entire matter of wireframing. The wireframing process comes hand in hand with the platform choice making. Whichever platform you choose, the wireframe needs to be developed according to that platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wireframing process is important for the later design and graphics process. It is the skeleton of your app and it needs to be built with care and precision. Choosing the platform will help you with that precision. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can choose to develop your app for both platforms. But initially, you need to choose one platform which suits your immediate needs the best.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Designing_the_UI_UX_of_the_app\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9. Should You Give Enough Attention to The Design And Layout?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To know how to develop an app that is going to be a wide success, you need to pay attention to the design and layout of the app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the thought \u201cI have an idea for an app\u201d makes it in your head, you should start thinking about how that app is going to look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The design and layout are going to create the first impression on your users, and first impressions matter more than you think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only thing you need to remember when it comes to the design and user interface is that it needs to be natural. There is no point in having an app with a hard to use interface. Your users are not going to spend time learning to use your app.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_9038\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9038\" style=\"width: 675px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9038\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/dmv1-1.jpg\" alt=\"how to make an app design\" width=\"675\" height=\"476\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9038\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: https:\/\/dribbble.com\/unifiedinfotech<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important that your user can find stuff and use your app easily. You have to keep it as simple as you can, without adding too much on the screen. The clutter can encourage users to get rid of your app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today\u2019s age of less is more, \u00a0having a minimal design with a seamless experience is the way to get users to love your app. Don\u2019t try to cram your app interface with icons and texts. Just keep it simple. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Fixing_the_Device_adaptability\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10. Should You Worry About Device Adaptability?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a large number of devices people can choose from these days. So device adaptability should be one of your top priority.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users are going to use more than one device to access your app. So by making your app adaptable for multiple devices is going to expand your user base. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a couple of factors when it comes to device adaptability of your app that you need to keep in mind. These are- <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">screen size and resolution,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">network bandwidth of different devices, <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">connectivity issues, <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">storage capacity <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">configuration details.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are trying to get your app suitable for a device, make sure to have a complete understanding of the functionality of the device before you start custom coding for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"The_size_of_your_app\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11. How Much Should The File Size Be? <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one wants to download and install an app that is too big in size. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile phones may have become more improved over the ages, but they still don\u2019t have as much space as a desktop computer. So making your app file size smaller is really going to pay off.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_9043\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9043\" style=\"width: 635px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9043\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/average-mobile-app-file-size-1-1.png\" alt=\"how to make an app and what should be the size\" width=\"635\" height=\"317\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9043\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: https:\/\/sweetpricing.com\/blog\/2017\/02\/average-app-file-size\/<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cutting down the amount of data consumed and the file size without hampering the experience should be your number one priority. Giving the users an app that has fast performance and small size means they will enjoy using your app for a longer time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Need_for_app_localization\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12. Should You Localize Your App?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Localization of your app means translating your app into multiple regional languages specific to different countries. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Localization of your app is a great way of getting global recognition. But what comes before localization?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you translate your app and localize it, you need to internationalize it. Internationalization is a process through which you optimize the code of your app so that it can be used globally. After that, you can go ahead with the localization of your app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Localization is going to give you a larger base of users from different countries. But does your app need localization?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no point in making an app available in a different language if it is only solving the US-based problem. Your app has to have a global appeal to achieve success through localization.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Testing_testing_testing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13. What Is Even Beta Testing?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to make a mobile app that satisfies your users?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through beta testing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beta testing is having your final product tested by a group of experienced testers. Through beta testing, you can get an idea of how your app is working. You can also find out what other optimizations need to be done to make your app ready to be launched in the market. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is crucial that you test and then retest your app before releasing it. With the help of an experienced team of beta testers, you can get important feedback on your app. This feedback is going to help you make your app better and user ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a strong number of beta testers, you can choose services like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/betalist.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BetaList<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.betabound.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Betabound<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and many more. These services are going to connect you with a strong team of public betas, giving you honest and useful feedback on your app. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Launching_and_marketing_of_your_app\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14. How Is Marketing Important For Your App?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because you are thinking \u201cI have an idea for an app, and it is so unique that it doesn\u2019t need marketing.\u201d does not mean it really does not need marketing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing your app is going to be more important than you think it is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More often than not, app makers actually ignore the importance of marketing. Which is how they end up with a stellar app but make no profit out of it. A marketing strategy that suits the functionality and features of your app is incredibly important.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_9325\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9325\" style=\"width: 635px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9325\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Graph-1_app-marketing-budget_pt.-2-1-1-1.png\" alt=\"how to make and app and do its marketing\" width=\"635\" height=\"646\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9325\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: https:\/\/themanifest.com\/app-development\/why-marketing-critical-mobile-app-success<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may miss out on the marketing opportunity because you along with the development team are focusing all your energy and investment on the development of the app. Which is why you need to make a clear marketing strategy and stick to it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The marketing of your app needs to start from an early stage. You need to get your target audience hyped up about your app. They need to know about your app, and why they should install it so that as soon as your app is launched, you get instant users. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/proven-mobile-app-monetization-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make money with your amazing app<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, marketing is also incredibly important. So don\u2019t forget to plan a proper marketing strategy to make the most out of your app. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Fixing_the_app_description\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15. Writing The Right Kind Of App Description<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the one thing anyone does before installing an app?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read the app description.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For most of us, the decision of installing the app is made halfway through the app description on the app store. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need a good app description to make people want to install your app. Google Play store and Apple app store both display only two-three lines of description before the read more option. You need to make sure that those initial lines get the potential user hooked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how to write a good app description?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about the first time you thought \u201cI have an idea for an app\u201d what was your vision then? How did you convince yourself to start working on your idea? And start from there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your description simple but interesting, telling the user what exactly is the apps purpose and why they need it. Don\u2019t add too many embellishments, and don\u2019t provide details they don\u2019t need.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Maintenance_and_upkeep\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">16. Final Maintenance And Upkeep Of The App<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just launching the app is not enough, you need to maintain the app as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the app is launched, you need to make sure that the app still functions well. Along with that, you also need to roll out updates, fixing the problems and bugs the previous version had. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important that you listen to user reviews as well. They might have their own suggestions about the app and its features. Listening to them and taking their advice is going to make sure that they stay loyal to your app. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So even after you have launched the app, you need to keep paying attention to the maintenance and upkeep of the app. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few Last Words<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know all the answers to the basic questions related to how to build an app, it is time for you to start working on that app idea you had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before you start working on it, don\u2019t forget to ask questions. It is your idea and your app. You have the right to know all the information you want to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making an app and making a successful app are two different things. To make your app successful, you need to ask as many questions as you can about the app and its development, test the app, again and again, to make it perfect for launch, and then keep up with the quality of the app even after it has been launched. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the right planning and strategy, your idea can also be the next breakthrough app. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9047\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/app-development-cost-freelancer-vs-agency-2-1.png\" alt=\"how to make an app freelancer vs agency\" width=\"981\" height=\"227\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/app-development-cost-freelancer-vs-agency-2-1.png 981w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/app-development-cost-freelancer-vs-agency-2-1-300x69.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/app-development-cost-freelancer-vs-agency-2-1-768x178.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the right planning and strategy, your idea can also be the next breakthrough app. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bonus: Should You Patent Your App Idea?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever heard of patenting an app?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, it is an actual thing and you too can patent your app,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how to Patent an App Idea? What are the things you need to know before running to the patent office?.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A. Eligibility<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So you are thinking \u201cI have an idea for an app, and it is really unique.\u201d but just because it is unique does not mean it can be patented. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin the patenting process, the first thing The USPTO (US Patent &amp; Trademark Office) would recommend you to perform a patent search before filing for a patent. You need to search for any related keywords to your app, or idea and see if someone has already filed for that patent or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can&#8217;t just patent your \u2018idea\u2019. To patent app idea, you need to have a complete understanding of how your app is going to work. On the application, you\u2019d have to give a complete description of what your app does and how it works. So if you just have a vague idea, then develop the idea a little before going for a patenting application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with being \u2018novel\u2019 your app idea also needs to work in a non-obvious or an unexpected way. This is where it gets a bit complicated. The basic idea is that people who are particularly skilled in your field need to consider your idea as extremely unique and unexpected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last criteria are really easy- your app needs to work. It needs to solve a problem, or just simply work. \u00a0Which is why you need to know exactly how your app is working. Knowing this, you would be able to give a detailed description of how your app is useful to the people.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B. Filing Process<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing you need to do is to file for a provisional patent application to secure a filing date for your patent. This is cheaper than filing for a non-provisional patent application and needs little effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Securing your filing date is important. It determines who was first-to-file in case of a legal problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to include visual elements in your application such as flow chart, drawings, and sketches of the app layout. This will help the patent officers decide whether your app is worth the patent or not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The one-year timeline provided to you in the provisional application gives you time to see if your app idea is going to be successful or not. Once you file the final Patent application, the final patenting process will start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you are probably not going to get the patent on the first time. The process would probably take anywhere from 1-3 years. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is Patenting Your App Worth It?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So patenting your app sounds like a good idea, and you are probably going to see if your app is worth patenting or not. But at the end of the day, is patenting worth it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After knowing how to patent app idea, you need to know about why to or why not to patent it. Sure patenting your app means protecting your idea and making sure no one rips it off, making a profit at your expense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But patenting is not going to protect your idea from being copied. The code can be copyrighted, sure, but at the end of the day, no code is really unique. There are numerous code libraries available online. You can easily find codes for any feature on your app there. So there is really nothing unique about coding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But most importantly, getting a patent for your app is a wild card. You already have to invest enough money to build your app and get it going. On top of that, investing money on the patent is going to cost you anywhere around $5000-$20000. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chances are, once you got your app in the market, if it doesn\u2019t do good enough business, you are going to shut it down. In that case, the money you spent will go down the drain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/ben-lee\/you-dont-need-a-patent-for-your-app-heres-why.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to experts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you don\u2019t really need to patent your app. It takes too much effort and resources away from you, which you could use to build your app.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So before you start the process of patenting your app, think about it carefully.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/top-app-monetization-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9049\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-16-4.png\" alt=\"how to build an app and ideas to make money\" width=\"981\" height=\"227\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-16-4.png 981w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-16-4-300x69.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-16-4-768x178.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p><em>We have been recognized as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designrush.com\/agency\/mobile-app-design-development\/new-york\" target=\"_blank\">Top Casablanca Mobile App Development Company<\/a> on DesignRush.

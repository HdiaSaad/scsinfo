And the most-loving fact is that we don\u2019t even have to wait for 4 years for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, on 28th December 2019, Saturday, our UIPL family witnessed the most-awaited cricket tournament of our organization.

The emotions, passions, dedications, and excitement attached to UPL is nothing less than the World Cup.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me take you through the journey of the Unified Premier League (UPL). And you\u2019ll know how much UPL means to the UIPL family.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Planning Warm-Up\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not like we just plan things within one week and head out to play. Every successful organization plans well before taking one-step.

And accordingly, we book the ground.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But organizing a cricket tournament is much more than that. We have to print flex and banners, prepare cup and medals for the winning team players. Also, there are food and drink arrangements for everyone including the players and the spectators.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything needs well-organized planning. So, for that, we build a committee that takes care of all these. This committee also takes care of all the necessary cricket equipment too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Teams<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have four cricket teams.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Fire Hunks<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>On the RockX<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pitch Smashers<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unified Super Kings<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Each team has 9 players. A total of 7 cricket matches are there. And each game is of 10 overs.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, not everyone can join the team. We enlist the names of interested candidates. Then they go through months of training and practice.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may wonder how everyone gets so much time! Well, that\u2019s the spirit of UIPL family. Everyone gives their best efforts and dedication to the work. And after that, they manage time to do exercise and play practice matches as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every year, team captains are selected by votes. And then team players are chosen through the UPL auction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Battle Day<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">28th December 2019, Saturday<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shivering cold.

But the game was on!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reporting time to reach the ground was 7.30 am. And the game spirit defeated the cold and chilly weather. Every player reached the ground by sharp 7.30 am. And the game was about to start by sharp at 8 am.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Game Is On<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>1st Match<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tournament\u2019s favorite team <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pitch Smashers<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the RockX<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> played the 1st match.

So, everyone was on the vibes of the Unified Premier league.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breakfast packets were served to everyone after the 2nd match.

And with a killer performance of the team, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pitch Smashers<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> won the match and became the 2nd finalist.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tanmay got injured during this match.

For instance: just below the purchasing item, you can keep a number of options like warranty options apart from the \u2018Add to cart\u2019 option. An \u2018add to wish list\u2019 item is yet another interesting way to keep customers stay at your website for a longer time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Can Your Website Handle Multiple Visitors?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether you go for a website redesign or any other development feature, always ask yourself, can your website handle multiple visitors? Holiday season is the peak time when you will witness a flood of visitors. Well, if you think that your website is not capable enough, fret not. Either go for shared hosting or a dedicated hosting. While you might have heard about these two kinds of hosting, however, Colocated hosting is yet another kind of hosting which can ease your task. Here, the company purchases server in its own name and has the host facility with it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Do You Want To Go For Redesign?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have been experiencing a slump in the number of visitors in your website, then it is the time that you go for a website redesign immediately. This is perhaps the best time to rebrand your business. Make changes in the navigation structure of the website and its URLs to help the customers get a new look for your website rather than experiencing the same bored look. You can also implement a 301 redirect plan. In addition to this, one can also change the fonts. Add a festive touch to the fonts to have a maximum impact on the visitors.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Jazz Up Your Website With These Amazing Holiday Tips<\/strong><\/em><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use a pop up on the home page of your website with a nice animation. This could also be a gif.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Write a holiday special blog post.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Send holiday special coupons to customers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spread the word in social media regarding any new deals or offers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep in touch with last year\u2019s buyers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Showcase the holiday special products in your home page.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Highlight the sign up portion of email.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Introduce customers to new brands.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Wrap Up!<\/strong><\/em><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no better time, other than the holiday season to improve your bottom line.

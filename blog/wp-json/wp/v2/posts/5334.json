Even after releasing the app, you might not witness much downloads. But, you have to understand that there are reasons why people don\u2019t use your mobile application.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Outdated Content<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Using the same old content repeatedly will bore your users. About 70% of people abandon the app after first use. The reason? They do not get any new thing. They always expect something, which is refreshing.

If your customer finds the app less attractive, then there is no point in releasing it. \u00a0An app must solve the problem of the customer. The time of your notifications should be simpler.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Our solution<\/strong>: Determine the demand of the app and then send the notifications.

Now, there\u2019s that smile on your face that site designers look for!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there is a slight hurdle &#8211;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identifying humor and sarcasm, for example: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;There is no need to call me Sir, <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor.&#8221;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for the humor that is best suited for the occasion and not going loud on it. Like &#8211; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With COVID-19 on the loose, and quarantine turning into a persistent headache, businesses are leaving no stone unturned to capture the market of the trade genre. This includes revamping their sites keeping user experience at the pivotal point. This is where the humor angle comes into play.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trades are banking on everything to fetch a &#8211;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grin,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laughter,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smirk,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smile,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chuckle,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snigger, or<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chortle<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With such a prospect, a user\u2019s engagement can be stretched for an extended period, and hence, all tricks are being pulled out of the sleeves of experts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So to say, \u2018humor\u2019 never went out of business. Starting the old, silent comedy movies, to the latest ones, they offer viewers with the much-needed touch of escapism in the hardcore journey of life. A majority of the time nowadays is spent looking at screens &#8211; laptops\/desktops\/phones. The blatant and mundane sites thus need an element that will provide a touch of humanity, and set up a string with the user\u2019s mind and the brand in question. What better a bridge than humor?!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">1.

Then again, on behalf of the websites, humor elements offer a positive user experience. And, subsequently, this leads to a strengthened relationship between the brand and the user.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, it\u2019s time to take a look at the humorous angle to website designing and look into all about its what, why, where, how, when to, and when not to.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_2\">2. Think Hilarity for Your Site<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UX design is all about consumer behavior and psychology. Catering to the clients is the prime focus of the digital world. Also, all businesses are left with the only option &#8211; setting a digital footprint to capture targeted clients. Consequently, site owners are willing to take up and imbibe all the trending elements into their website that will boost the web traffic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the humor-effect, there are chances of boosted interest and spiked energy levels on behalf of the clients. But the art of imbibing humor to bait the clients in and increase the conversion rate lies on a thin line &#8211; knowing when, how, why, where to implement the laughter-angle. A toe on the line, and you will be creating a major mishap of disrespecting your clients or hitting on the sarcastic nerve, rather than the humor one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few questions to ask yourself that will get you the blueprint to a successful humor-kissed site.

Check them out and plan for the humor element that you can bank upon &#8211;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Chatbots<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Chatbots are popular amidst the digital civilization.

It may be that a humor element is working fine with your competitor, but it isn\u2019t so with you. In that case, you would need to take that down. At times you may also need to tone down on your humor.

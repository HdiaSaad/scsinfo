And with the world turning tip-to-toes into click-o-maniacs, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/photo-sharing-apps\/\" target=\"_blank\">photo sharing apps<\/a> have been the hot favorite among Smart users.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>Zinc<\/b><\/span> is also a social photo-sharing platform that has many stored app goodies for their users. Unlike others, this event photo sharing app crowdsources photos from friends and other event participants quickly and painlessly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>USP<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">: \u00a0<\/span>You no longer need to remind your friends to send you their photos from the \u201cOne Direction Live Concert\u201d or from the \u201cProm Nights.\u201d Whether you have taken the snaps or not, event photos will be on your profile feed instantly anytime and anywhere.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">Too easy! Zinc works in just three steps &#8211;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>How to Use Zinc<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload photos from the event you want to share to the Zinc photo library<\/li>\n<li>Select one photo and click &#8216;Create Event&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Enter the event details, and click \u2018Save Event\u2019<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>VOILA! You\u2019re done\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Zinc will do the rest for you. It will start sensing which of your other photo belongs to the album, not only that it also helps you friends and other active users know that the photos they have photos belongs there as well.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">No matter what you spend on professional event photography, you know that the guests are going to record the event whole day \u2013 every corner and glitches starting from the stage to the crowd, lights to food stalls. Thus, several apps have made it to the App and Play Store to crowdsource photos under a single album. It allows you to access snapshots captured at the next festival, party or wedding you attend.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>How UIPL Helped ZincNow<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>ZincNow also wanted to work on a crowdsourced photo-sharing app, but with a twist.<br \/>\nZinc people wanted something exclusive and unique that will help them to revolutionize the world of event photo sharing. As most of the app was doing well in their respective features, Zinc took on the idea of geo-tagging and location based photo detection. Thus, reduce your effort to search for a location based event album. You simply need to add the photos and leave the rest to Zinc.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">At UIPL, we just did the same what Zinc wanted. However, we faced many technical challenges in the design and the architecture but our developers did it finally! Flexibility, scale, and high availability are core considerations. The app is fun and has a sticky user experience. We made sure that the app maintains quality and speed while sharing photos of different sizes across diverse devices in real-time. Mainly we developed the app for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/ios-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\">iOS platform<\/a> in the first phase, but Zinc plans to launch multiple OS versions soon. Offering high security is always a critical option, it\u2019s important for the app to protect the users information and content giving them the power to connect each other, create albums and share visual contents at a granular level.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>Developing ZincNow at Our Lab\u2026<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Zinc people required an agile development model, which meant continuous delivery of a consistently production-ready app with enhancements. The short time frame requires full focus on the essential features and attentive management of the requirements under variety of stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p>Its common for the apps to look for balance of feature inclusion, performance and quality, cost-effectiveness, and time to market. But for Zinc\u2019s case they required higher confidentiality, intense competition and potentially huge visibility. And the project became intently successful in the hands of mature and experienced software architects and designers.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Most unique feature is their sharing option which ranges from \u2013 Private profiles, friends of friends sharing, public and more.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>Exciting Features to Keep You Glued to the App<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is able to sync all photos from you, your friends and others in a consistent timeline. Well, the app makes sure of no random assortment of photos.<\/li>\n<li>You can keep a tab on your friends list and decide on the audience with whom you want to share the event photos.<\/li>\n<li>Enables location based photo sharing and tag photos that belong to any particular event saving you to sift from camera roll<\/li>\n<li>You can create 5 (max) #hashtags to popularize one event<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To know their other features you need to install the app and enjoy a breakthrough experience photo-sharing world.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>How Can You Access Zinc?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>You can sign in to the ZincNow app with your phone number. It adds up your friend from the contact list, and if someone is not registered on the app, you can easily send an invitation to add him or her &#8211; Just like Whatsapp! If you lose your mobile, the photos won\u2019t. You can soon access it if you log it with the same phone number or from a friends iPhone, that\u2019s terrific!

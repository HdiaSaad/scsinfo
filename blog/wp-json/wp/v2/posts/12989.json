Let\u2019s face it- the world right now is full of virtual stores. We can find an online shop on every corner of the internet. And in this densely populated virtual shopping world, a digital shopping platform needs the most unique experience on it to stand out!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And no, we don\u2019t say it from basic knowledge, but from real-life understanding.

We are not going to keep our wisdom and experience a secret.

Not only this happens to be part of our main work process, but based on the newfangled requirements of this new platform, we recalibrated our R&amp;D process to match the goals. And to do that, these objectives assisted us a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the main objectives we started with-<\/span><\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refashion the eCommerce experience, ensuring that the platform is unmatched in its superiority in the modern industry landscape.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase website ROI and engagement levels through the implementations of the right design and business components on the interface.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simplifying shopping and payment practices to boost the efficacy of the platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping the three objectives mentioned above we began our research process. A point to be noted, our research process in this case was not only limited to the in-depth market and demographic research. To accommodate the exemplary demands, our team went beyond the normalized scope of research and delved deeper into technology and design psychology research as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason for this research process expansion is simple- to ensure a completely original type of positive experience; we aimed to introduce some new kinds of tech and design. And for that, we pulled in various resources and references to create a complete experience on the site that goes beyond what is called \u2018normal\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_3\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Challenges Never Seen Before!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unique opportunities come with unique challenges. And this time was no different. From the beginning, we were confronted by various predicament never before experienced in all our years of experience in developing state-of-the-art digital solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what were these formidable challenges?<\/span><\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First challenge was demographics. The target demographic was a mix of millennials and Gen Z, and everyone in the design world knows that this demographic is the hardest to please.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second challenge was all about transformation. Devising a strategy to keep the finicky audience on the site long enough to transform them was a tough task (but we accomplished it anyway!)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crafting a content strategy that is light and breezy, but valuable enough for the users.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building an ideal buyer support channel for the DIY generation.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combining the client&#8217;s aspirations and demographic demands was not exactly easy. But our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/how-we-work\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agile work practices<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the versatile teams of experts put all their minds and skills on the table to make this impossible task possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The One Plan To Rule The Whole Process<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A plan is necessary for successful process execution. And that\u2019s why after we were done with the research phase, we collected all the data and collaborated with the client to create a plan that fits the goals and speed up the entire operation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every aspect of the whole operation was recorded within this plan. Leaving nothing to chance or assumptions, the plan guided each step of the procedure till we had a complete and flawless product ready to go live. From the design requirements to tech stack and security necessities, we ensured all of it was included and outlined in the plan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_4\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A. Our Discovery Phase: The Key To Successful Development<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our unrivaled remedy for the eCommerce platform in the discussion is the result of a long and in-depth exploration and examination phase. This step in our process is dedicated to documenting the client\u2019s goals in detail and conducting research to find data and related information that helped us to bring those goals to reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even the minute details had a major significance for us. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our in-house team of experts, owing to their long term association with us as one of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bestdesigns.co\/magazine-ad-design\"><b>Top Casablanca Digital Agencies<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offering eCommerce solutions, prioritizes each detail. The team then executed <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">various research into the sector of fashion eCommerce, and then specifically on the user demographic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a fragmented target clientele of 17-24 and 25-36, the eCommerce platform required special attention to design and feature details. Keeping that in mind, we gathered as much data as possible to create a robust plan that will be applied in the later stages of the development. Based on a combination of the data and client discussion, we drafted a scheme that included clientage persona, guide, and other particulars. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the crucial bits in that plan!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_5\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B. The Unified Design Thinking<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being experienced in creating diverse types of digital solutions, we have some curated in-house design methods. These methods are easy to modify based on the specific requirements of the clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The design objective in this scenario was one-of-a-kind! The main demographic consisted of fashion-concerned millennials and Gen Z who are extremely critical of any kind of digital platform. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To satisfy these critical audiences, we had to bring out the aces in our sleeves, i.e. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/web-design-for-millennial-strategy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our process of designing for the millennial generation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the millennial design tricks, we also had to start with a buyer model. With this neat process, the SCS INFO design team gained a better perception of the main audience for this site and the kind of eCommerce solutions they want. Needless to say, once we had the persona in hand, designing and implementing the right features was a cakewalk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12991 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/buyer-persona-1024x742.jpg\" alt=\"buyer persona\" width=\"1024\" height=\"742\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/buyer-persona-1024x742.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/buyer-persona-300x217.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/buyer-persona-768x556.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/buyer-persona.jpg 1111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on this persona, we focused on some specific areas of design that seemed to be significant to impress the patrons.

Our Responsive Approach<\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The efficiency of shopping from phones is undeniably popular now. And that\u2019s why the responsive approach was the first thing we started with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12992 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/responsive-ecommerce-design.jpg\" alt=\"responsive e-commerce design\" width=\"825\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/responsive-ecommerce-design.jpg 825w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/responsive-ecommerce-design-300x227.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/responsive-ecommerce-design-768x581.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During research and analysis, we came across the client organization\u2019s Google analytics data that showed us that almost <\/span><b>35% of target customers are visiting the site from mobile<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Keeping that data in mind, we picked a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0responsive minimalist <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outline that looks and functions well no matter what device is being used.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Revolutionizing The Design\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The particular aesthetic conditions of the demographic needed to be fulfilled flawlessly. And that\u2019s why we crafted a complete design guide, that outlines how the site needs to look and feel for the users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12993 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/style-guide.jpg\" alt=\"style guide\" width=\"825\" height=\"879\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/style-guide.jpg 825w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/style-guide-282x300.jpg 282w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/style-guide-768x818.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, meeting these conditions is not the only objective. In order to carve out a space for themselves in the crowded marketplace, our client needed a distinct identity. Our design team at SCS INFO facilitated this requirement with the definitive design-manual approach. This guide incorporates all design components of the site that will make up the organization&#8217;s identity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating A Hierarchy Of Content<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes the content hierarchy of the eCommerce platform seems a little confusing. That&#8217;s why we set out to construct a wireframe that outlines the content hierarchy of the site. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12994 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/content-hierarchy.jpg\" alt=\"content hierarchy\" width=\"825\" height=\"788\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/content-hierarchy.jpg 825w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/content-hierarchy-300x287.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/content-hierarchy-768x734.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the biggest of headlines to the smallest footnotes, the content frame included all and helped to create an interface that is easy to understand and navigate.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imbibing The Sense Of Trust<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our effort to make the design trustworthy has two reasons-<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a. Firstly, the target viewers the platform deals with is well aware of the dark design practices. Any shady element on the platform will repel them for good and will make it hard to retain patrons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b. Transparency is one of our main design objectives. We are always aiming to craft aesthetics for digital solutions that provide real utility rather than duping people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12995 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/honesty-trust-in-design-point.jpg\" alt=\"honesty trust in design point\" width=\"825\" height=\"788\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/honesty-trust-in-design-point.jpg 825w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/honesty-trust-in-design-point-300x287.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/honesty-trust-in-design-point-768x734.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eCommerce sites happen to be the main ground for all kinds of ill-design practice. And that\u2019s why we were careful in integrating elements that invoke a positive feeling. And to accomplish this, we used a carefully constructed content strategy that set the atmosphere of fun and enjoyment on the website.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_6\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C. The Features That Made The Platform A Success!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are a big believer in the fact that the right features can change the ROI of the platform. Keeping the unique objectives of both the business and the consumers, we drafted and implemented the following features on the platform that ensure better results.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Feature Of Reliability: Product Description<\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Product specifications help the visitants to make quick judgments and get along with the buying process. And that\u2019s why we gave special attention to this feature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12996 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/produc_description-feature.jpg\" alt=\"product description feature\" width=\"825\" height=\"810\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/produc_description-feature.jpg 825w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/produc_description-feature-300x295.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/produc_description-feature-768x754.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A clear and visible description on the site is a mandatory feature to integrate.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Reaching The Height Of Personalization With Recommendations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personalization is key, and suggestions are the perfect tool to implement it. We integrated the AI\/ML systems that examined visitor behavior, browsing activity, and shopping history to promote the products they might be interested in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12997 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/produc_recommendation.jpg\" alt=\"product recommendation\" width=\"825\" height=\"1118\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/produc_recommendation.jpg 825w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/produc_recommendation-221x300.jpg 221w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/produc_recommendation-756x1024.jpg 756w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/produc_recommendation-768x1041.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this feature, we streamlined the process for the users, ensuring that there remain no glitches in the browsing and shopping activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Building The Right Kind Of Cart<\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the beginning, our SCS INFO team aimed to enhance the cart experience. With ample investigation, we recognized the normal shortcomings of the cart functionality on existing platforms and worked to eliminate them from the new platform altogether.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12998 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/shopping-cart.jpg\" alt=\"shopping cart\" width=\"825\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/shopping-cart.jpg 825w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/shopping-cart-300x197.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/shopping-cart-768x505.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.

We implemented interactive elements such as CTAs and forms that will hook the users to the site and keep them browsing forever.

So we had to find a way that helps the visitants to resolve any matter on their own, but at the same time reach out to the support executives without having to stay on call forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that\u2019s why we utilized the sophisticated Chatbot feature. These bots permit the visitants to get the answer to queries without having to scramble around for the Q&amp;A section. At the same time, the bots can always link up with an executive through the inbox in case of a more grievous matter.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\">Read Also: <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/digital-transformation-strategy\/\">It\u2019s High Time Your Business Went Digital!

Finding The Tech Stack: Our Expert Choices<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A platform that seeks to reinvent the entire fashion shopping activity needs the right kind of tech stack. And that\u2019s why the specialist team members at SCS INFO put all their heart and mind into determining the ideal tech stack for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following tech stack for the multinational eCommerce platform was chosen with a lot of factors in mind, and the high quality of the performance was one of them. The in-house experts ensured that the tech stack is flexible and supports the future growth of the platform. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13000 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/techstack-table-1024x630.jpg\" alt=\"techstack table\" width=\"1024\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/techstack-table-1024x630.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/techstack-table-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/techstack-table-768x473.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/techstack-table.jpg 1111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The combination of the open-source solution and database\/cloud storage framework ensured great performance, as well as flexibility for future changes.

Our Testing Process To Improve Quality<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no way we were going to let the site go live without proper performance and immunity testing. Our work process at SCS INFO adheres to strict testing procedures. During these tests, our in-house security and tech experts collaborated with the testing team to improve the quality of the site. Here are the two most essential tests the site went through to ensure its quality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a. Security Testing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of this practice is to secure every aspect of the site. And that\u2019s why our in-house testing team conducted a series of security examinations on the site to recognize and eradicate any persisting security issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through static and dynamic testing the initial vulnerabilities on the site were exposed during this phase. These frailties were then resolved by the in-house developers with the utmost precision. Only when we were sure about the impeccable quality of the platform we launched it into the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b. Load &amp; Stress Testing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Load and stress testing put the site through a full quality check. With this method, the expert testers put the platform under the envisioned load to observe how well it is able to handle it. For any shortcomings, we made quick recalibration until the platform provided quality service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During stress testing, we went a step ahead and put the site under more traffic than it can handle. Based on the results, we made the necessary changes to sharpen the functionality of the site.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s Time To Start Talking About Your Ecommerce Endeavor<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing a state of the art eCommerce platform is always fun, especially when it is such a unique one.

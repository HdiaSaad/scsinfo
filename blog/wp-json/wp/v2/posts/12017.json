This has made them more outspoken and passionate about various social causes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the study conducted by Harris Interactive<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Millennials are more prone to take a company\u2019s stand of various social issues into consideration before even interacting with them. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.conecomm.com\/news-blog\/new-cone-communications-research-confirms-millennials-as-americas-most-ardent-csr-supporters\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70% of millennials would not mind making a personal sacrifice<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, such as paying more for a product if the company happens to support a social cause they are passionate about.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_12027\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12027\" style=\"width: 512px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-12027 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/stand-up-for-something.png\" alt=\"stand up for something\" width=\"512\" height=\"242\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/stand-up-for-something.png 512w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/stand-up-for-something-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-12027\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: https:\/\/www.jnj.com\/caring<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that\u2019s why getting the millennials to interact with your website, you have to show them that you are not only passionate about social issues but also trying to make an impact with your website.

They would rather wear the casual outfit to work every day and call everyone by their first names rather than Mr. This or Miss. that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, infuriating this millennial tendency is for many out there, it is only because millennials want to shed the excess of action and get to the core of the matter as soon as possible. They want to get up close and personal with issues they are dealing with and don\u2019t like to waste time with formalities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that\u2019s why when designing your website content for millennials, you need to be more direct.

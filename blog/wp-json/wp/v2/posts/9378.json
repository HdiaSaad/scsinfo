No wonder Swiggy, Ubereats, and Zomato have a lot of competitors growing up every day. Now that you are well aware of the market and popularity of food delivery app, let\u2019s learn about how to make your own food delivery app and <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what are the types of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">food delivery apps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you can make.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"Fix_a_food_delivery_model\">2. What Are The Types Of Food Delivery Apps You Can Go For?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s see the two major types of on-demand food app models that exist in the market.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>a. Third-Party App a.k.a The Aggregator Model<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aggregator model, or the third party food delivery apps have been in the market for more than a decade. They are the perfect mediators between you and your favorite restaurant. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This model enables customers to browse through a wide variety of restaurants and their menus. The user first creates an account, \u00a0goes through the list of restaurants and their reviews by other customers and makes their choice.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After making their choice, they will place an order, and the order information is processed for delivery. the main function of this third-party app is to connect the two parties. Apps like Zomato uses this model.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/how-to-make-an-app\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"981\" height=\"227\" class=\"wp-image-9389\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/app-development-tricks-1-1.png\" alt=\"how to make food delivery app\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/app-development-tricks-1-1.png 981w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/app-development-tricks-1-1-300x69.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/app-development-tricks-1-1-768x178.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the delivery part of the order is taken care of by the restaurant, this is perfect for the big restaurants. But when it comes to the newer and smaller restaurants, it is harder to be featured on these apps. And that is where the next type comes in.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>b. Logistics\/Delivery Service Type:<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a fairly new kind of delivery service that only emerged around 2013. This is a similar platform like the aggregator model only with one added facility<\/span>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The order delivery is handled by the application itself.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike the aggregator model, this is highly profitable to startups, since they don\u2019t have to maintain a separate delivery system for the orders. And this cuts down the expenses significantly.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for already established restaurants, it only adds to the profit, since they can now cut down on manpower spending and focus more on the main processing part. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the former involves only two parties &#8211; the restaurant and the users, for the latter, you need to develop an additional platform for delivery services. Apps like UberEats use this model.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"Requirements_of_Aggregator_model\">3. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food Ordering App Model and Its Requirements<\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here we are going to talk about the Aggregator model in details.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you make an on demand food delivery app development partnership for the Aggregator model, you\u2019ll need to develop three different sides of the app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The customer app<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The admin app<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The delivery person app<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s talk about them in details. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Customer App<\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The customer app is obviously the key to it all. This is the app that is going to be installed into the device of the customer. They are going to use this app to order from the restaurants listed. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since this app is the key app, you have to make sure that this is made perfectly. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to know how smooth the UI of your food delivery application needs to be, then you can check out our <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/unifiedinfotech\">Dribble<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/unifiedinfotech\">Behance<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> portfolio.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The user experience needs to be smooth and without bugs. The app needs to have features that make the ordering experience better for the user. We will talk about the feature a little later. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let&#8217;s talk about the admin app.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Admin App<\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The admin app is obviously going to be used by the authorized personnel of the food delivery service or of the restaurant. This is the app that is used to accept customer orders, dispatch the said orders, handle payments, track orders through the integration of real-time GPS tracking technology, and keep up with the logistics of it all.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than creating it as a mobile app, you can make it a web-based software. Since this is going to be the brain of the entire operation, you need to pay significant attention to the development and maintenance of this app. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any problems or crashes can mean loss of business, revenue and reputation for your service. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Delivery Person App<\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This food on demand app\u00a0is for the ones who are making the delivery. With this app, they can know if there are any new orders, they can also accept and reject the order. Along with that, they can find out what is the drop-off location of the order, and how to get there. In brief, this app is going to help them in every way to smoothly deliver the food to the user.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"Finalize_the_major_features\">4. What Features Does Your Food Delivery App Need?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to have amazing features in your app that helps in retaining customers if you want to make apps like Postmates.

This way you will have a better grasp at the features your app needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have figured out the features for your custom food delivery app, you can make sure that your app appears different and unique when compared to all the apps out there. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.

Not only for customer apps, but you also need this feature for both the admin and the delivery person app. You can also get this feature in any restaurant delivery app builder.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B. Profile Management<\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this feature, <strong>your users<\/strong> can optimize their profile with the right information, which is important for order placement and delivery.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>For the admin app,<\/strong> profile management is even more important. The restaurants need to have a proper profile and be able to update it to make the best business for them.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as for the <strong>delivery person app<\/strong>, they need to register and manage their profile with the right credentials. As employees of the food delivery platform, they need to provide you with the right details through their profiles.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.

But of course, customers should not be kept waiting too long, <em>especially when they are hungry<\/em>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_10269\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10269\" style=\"width: 1988px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10269 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/location-tracking-fetaure-in-food-delivery-app-1.jpg\" alt=\"how to make a food delivery app\" width=\"1988\" height=\"974\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/location-tracking-fetaure-in-food-delivery-app-1.jpg 1988w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/location-tracking-fetaure-in-food-delivery-app-1-300x147.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/location-tracking-fetaure-in-food-delivery-app-1-768x376.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/location-tracking-fetaure-in-food-delivery-app-1-1024x502.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1988px) 100vw, 1988px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10269\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Order tracking feature we designed<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is normal for any custom food app to have the feature of order tracking feature. With this, the customer will be able to see when their order is being dispatched and its progress towards them. They can also get an estimated time on when the order will be delivered. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, tracking the food while waiting is better than blindly waiting.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>G. Easy Payment Gateway Integration<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can be done in two different ways. Apart from COD or cash on delivery, you can keep credit\/debit card option as online payment mode. This is the easiest and faster way of receiving payment and safe too.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many customers today prefer the online payment method, so make sure while you make a food delivery app, you have multiple online payment options. Achieve it with options like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.braintreepayments.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Braintree<\/a>, Stripe, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ccavenue.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">CCAvenue<\/a>, etc. This is an important feature, so don\u2019t skip over it. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">H. Ratings And Reviews<\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You need to know before you make a food delivery app, that customer ratings and reviews are important and need to be displayed on the app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the ratings and reviews feature, customers can leave reviews on the restaurants listed on the website, the different food they have ordered and the delivery services. This feature not only helps the other users to choose the right place to get their food from, but also the restaurants and the food delivery platform itself, to know where they can improve more. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>I. Offers, Coupons, Rewards and Loyalty Benefits<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who doesn\u2019t like offers and coupons? Especially when it comes to food?<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you have plenty of offers and coupons for the users. These special offers are going to retain your users and bring in more users. With special collaboration with the restaurants you can offer attractive offers to the users, who in turn will become loyal customers to the restaurants, and your app.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>J. Push Notifications<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, you can not skip over this feature when you make a food delivery app. The push notification is absolutely important, because without this, how can the users know when there are any special offers going on, or that their food is almost there?<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you have to make sure not to bombard the users with annoying notifications all the time. Let them choose what notifications they want to see and when they want to see it. This will add another layer of user satisfaction on your app experience.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>There are other features you need to consider for all your other models of apps like the admin app and the delivery person\u2019s app. For example, you need a dashboard for the admin app, just like GrubHub dashboard.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"The_tech_stack_to_a_robust_app_base\">5.

Right?<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, you are not exactly wrong when you think this.\u00a0Food delivery apps are liked by everyone, but there is still a slight point of preference you have to consider before you make a restaurant app. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To set up your niche, you need to determine your customers first. Who are you making the app for? Students or workers?<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they prefer fast food, or better restaurant quality dishes?<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are they vegetarians or hard-core meat lovers?<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only after analyzing all the data you can make your app more distinguished than all the other apps out there. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B. Implementing The Correct UX<\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can&#8217;t ignore the importance of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/ui-ux-design\/\" target=\"_blank\">right UX design<\/a> when you make a food delivery app.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And your food delivery app is no exception either. A good UX design is a driving force behind your app\u2019s success. You need to ensure that your app is easy to navigate by the user. They also need to be able to find the information they need easily.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10276 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/user-experience-2.jpg\" alt=\"how to make a food delivery app\" width=\"1279\" height=\"854\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/user-experience-2.jpg 1279w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/user-experience-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/user-experience-2-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/user-experience-2-1024x684.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\u00a0<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So when you are thinking about <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to create a food delivery app, you need to know that<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the interface needs to be both detailed and minimalist at the same time.

While there are two broad categories of developers: Freelancers, Agencies, you\u2019re always advised to go for the latter. Agencies have the proper expertise and latest development tools at their disposal, which freelancers mostly lack. The right food ordering app development company will deliver the app to the stipulated deadlines and never play around with your budget.<br \/><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus getting an app developed by an agency comes with proper product licensing, guarantee and commitment that freelancers often fail to offer. Thus, it is always advised that you go for an agency if you want quality service delivered within minimum time and budget.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"Determine_the_cost_of_food_delivery_app_development\">8. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Much Will A Food Delivery App Development Cost?<\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After learning all about how to develop a food delivery app, you must be thinking about how much is it going to cost?<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter the type of app you\u2019re developing, it always comes with its respective price tag.

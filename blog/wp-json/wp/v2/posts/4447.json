Now, we will give you a macro view of its various benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">\u00a0Earlier, it was really difficult to keep all the iTunes music as well as TV series in your Apple gadgets, as space always posed as a problem but now with the arrival of iCloud, you can easily download music from iTunes or TV shows and at the same time can also store them.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: large;\">\u00a0Whenever you choose iCloud, you get a free me.com email id.

It is better to be aware of such mails and not to fall under the trap of a third party who can have access to all your personal information stored in iCloud with the help of Cryptolocker, a type of software that unlocks your accounts and encrypts all the files.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Well, in order to prevent yourself from falling under any such trap it is advisable that you do not click on the links of any mail that was sent to you from Apple. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><i><b>WWDC 2016 Conference And Many More \u2026<\/b><\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">There are lots of hopes and expectations from WWDIC, 2016 (Apple Worldwide Developer\u2019s Conference) which is to be held from June 13-17. The conference is mainly targeted at developers and all the iPhone users. This conference is going to throw light on increasing the awareness in strengthening the iCloud security. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Apart from that, there are a number of things, which we can expect from the conference. Let us have a look at all of them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>A New Macbook Pro<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">We haven\u2019t seen any new version of MacBook coming up since 2012. The Conference might announce the arrival of the latest version of Macbook. It is rumored that the new one could include some additional features such as USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3 ports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>An All New Apple Pay<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Apple Pay is expected to undergo some new modifications. One can now gather more loyalty points now and get help for withdrawing money from the ATM.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>Apple TV In A New Avtar<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">If the rumors are to be believed, then Apple TV is working on a streaming service in order to take over Netflix. It could also open up more gaming options to developers as far as improvements are concerned. As of now, in order to play the Apple games, one needs to have a Siri remote, but a more improved version of the Apple TV could just be the simple use of control pads. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">iCloud will prove to be beneficial for the coming tech-savvy generation that lives and breathes social media and technology. With so many pictures clicked in one single day and so many documents to take care of, nothing could be a better option other than iCloud for Apple users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">For an interesting update on iCloud keep coming here.

It is always easier for your user to be matched and go on dates with someone close to them. So you can apply a GPS based location system if you want to build a dating app to find potential matches for the user. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This way they can easily find a list of all the people who can be the potential match, and all of these people on the list will be from the same city.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can add a special monetization feature with this, where the users will pay to expand their search and match radius.

To know how to make a mobile dating app, understand the math of love.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This technique is used to assess the compatibility level of two users based on the answers they have given to the questions. When the compatibility level is higher than a certain number, they are matched with each other. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c. Match According To Behaviour<\/span><\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sad thing about any kind of online platform is that people tend to lie about many things. Which is why you should go with the behavior-based matching technique. This is basically a Big-Data based approach to match the users on a dating app.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_10094\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10094\" style=\"width: 825px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10094\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Find-matches-nearby.gif\" alt=\"how to build a dating app\" width=\"825\" height=\"780\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10094\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Finding people nearby in dating app by Unified Infotech<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a bit more complicated than location-based or simple question-answer based solution, but it is more accurate.

Matching With Your Objective<\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The users should have an option to express their objective o their profile. An online dating app user can have many reasons for using the service. It can be for a long term relationship or a quick and casual affair. Whatever it is, they should have an option to state that on their profile.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with that, they should also get matches with similar objectives. It\u2019s no use for someone who is looking for a serious relationship to be matched with those who are looking for a casual hook up. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c. In-app Messaging <\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no point in having a dating app and not having a messaging feature. With this feature, users can connect with each other and talk to each other, planning dates and meetings. This will help them not only in getting closer but also in understanding whether this match is worth investing their time on or not. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">d.

Undoing The Mistaken Swipe Or Like<\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many times we have mistakenly swiped right when really, we wanted to swipe left. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give people a chance to undo their mistake when you are planning on how to create your own dating platform. They might have accidentally tapped on like for someone\u2019s profile when they didn\u2019t want to. Give them a small window of opportunity to undo their choices. This will increase their chances of ending up with someone they actually like. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">f. See The Preference &#8211; Do They Like The Same Thing As You?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For a lot of people, not liking the same movie or tv series is a deal-breaker.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it makes sense if they can see the basic preferences for their matches on your application. Let them dedicate a small portion of their profile to their favorite music, shows, and tv series. This is going to help them create that perfect ice-breaking conversation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">g. Push Notification<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Got new matches? Show it on your push notification feature! Though it might annoy sometimes, if done right, it can actually increase the app usage and engagement. The trick is to keep the notifications relevant and less frequent. Try out this feature as you go deeper into the development.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"id_6\" style=\"text-align: left;\">6.

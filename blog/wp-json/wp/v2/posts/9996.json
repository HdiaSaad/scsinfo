What Is Web Design Psychology?<\/h2>\n<p>Impressive website design is not just about making it look good and delivering high-quality and interactive content. In reality, it is much more than that.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i>Design is all about making choices. Each color, font, line, text, shape, and the graphic you use will ultimately influence the message you&#8217;re trying to get across. If your visitors don\u2019t feel connected to your website, they are never going to convert.<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Usually, the initial decisions made online are based on subconscious and emotions. Visitors are going to make a judgment about your site even before they read a single word of text!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is it a safe site?<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are the colors making the visitors feel excited, warm, amused, sad?<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the website giving them a feel like yes, this is the right place?<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are the available choices appropriate and clear?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s not like visitors are going to stay on your website for a long time to decide all these. Within microseconds, all these factors are evaluated. Well, that\u2019s the time you have in your hand to impress them, to keep them engaged in your site for longer.<\/p>\n<p>The psychology of web design helps you to understand all these factors and to make a user-engaging website.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step2\">2. The Perks Of Using Psychology In Web Design<\/h2>\n<p>According to experts,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i>Considering the psychological impulses of your target audience can have a significant amount of positive influence on your users.<\/i><i>\u00a0<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Presenting what your customers want to see on the website is the secret to boost the business conversion rate. When you pay attention to how visitors naturally grasp information and accordingly offer them a conducive and appealing experience, they&#8217;ll be far more receptive. Also, they likely to perform the actions you want them to.<\/p>\n<p>Here is how the design psychology can benefit your business.<\/p>\n<h3>A. Building Trust<\/h3>\n<p>No matter how intriguing your website design is unless it gives your visitors a feeling of trust on some level, they are not going to convert. Now, with so many digital scams and identity theft issues in the news, trust won\u2019t come that easily, not even with a tag like <strong>\u201cTRUST US, We are the Experts!\u201d\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A website that offers recognizable and familiar patterns instantly puts your visitors at ease. Does it mean I am saying no to the creativity?<\/p>\n<p>Well, no, creativity is always welcome in website design. It helps you to stand out in the crowd. But, steering too far away from the basic expectations of users can be counterproductive at times.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/web-design-trends-2019-for-entrepreneurs\/\" target=\"_blank\">Make the website design creative<\/a> but make sure your site is stating its purpose clearly. The moment visitors come to your site, they should understand what your site is about. They should be able to move between the web pages effortlessly. In this way, you can gain their trust.<\/p>\n<h3>B. Psychological Triggers<\/h3>\n<p>Emotional and psychological triggers influence website visitors to take certain actions. Design elements like images, colors, fonts, etc. along with well-worded text that can reinforce the desired communication create emotional triggers for the visitors.<\/p>\n<p>Images are useful for reinforcing concepts. The right image choices show your professionalism and present your intent clearly. Similarly, the color tone you are using for the website design has a great impact on how visitors react as well as engage with your website.<\/p>\n<p>Be it a long-established website or a brand new one &#8211; understanding the basic principles behind human behavior and integrating all those while designing a website can bring rewards.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step3\">3. Design Psychology Principles To Apply On Your Site<\/h2>\n<p>Well, if you&#8217;ve reached this far while reading, we can safely assume that you already have got a basic idea about what role human psychology plays in web development. Now, coming to your main concern i.e. how to use this psychology in web design.<\/p>\n<p>No, I am not going to give you a playbook on it that will tell you the wrong and the right way to design a site. Things don\u2019t work like that here. Brushing up on psychological principles will help you to understand how to create an intuitive design experience.<\/p>\n<h3>A. The Von Restorff Effect<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes while designing, you want your visitors\u2019 attention to be drawn to one particular spot &#8211; even if other design elements are there around it. This is where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coglode.com\/gem\/von-restorff-effect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofoolow noopener noreferrer\">Von Restorff Effect<\/a> works the best.<\/p>\n<p>I am not going to spend more words on it as the image below can explain the effect better.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_9997\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9997\" style=\"width: 644px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9997 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Von-Restroff-Example.jpg\" alt=\"psychology of web design\" width=\"644\" height=\"230\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9997\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Target Jobs<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h3>B. Mental Models<\/h3>\n<p>UX designers and computer scientists talk a lot about mental models. Mental modeling is the process that maps out \u201c<i>what a human brain understands about real-world through experience and replicating those models in the design of virtual space<\/i>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To design a website from visitors\u2019 eyes, web designers should have a little bit of knowledge on this mental modeling. To apply it successfully on your website, your designers have to do an \u201cintuitive check\u201d throughout the entire design process. Are your visuals moving top to bottom, right to left? Is the message you are trying to convey easy-to-understand and clear?<\/p>\n<p>A gut check with your coworker or a friend can help you to understand whether the mental modeling is working fine in your designs or not.<\/p>\n<h3>C. Gestalt Psychology<\/h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.interaction-design.org\/literature\/book\/the-glossary-of-human-computer-interaction\/gestalt-principles-of-form-perception\" target=\"_blank\">Gestalt psychology<\/a>, you can explore how design elements are grouped together.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s check out a quick video on this explaining what similarity, proximity, continuity, closure, figure, and ground are in web designing.<br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/dk7cXdjX2Ys\" width=\"727\" height=\"409\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><strong>Similarity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Similar looking objects will be perceived as a part of the same group or as one object.

The Psychology Of Shapes In Web Design<\/h2>\n<p>If you are thinking that big brands choose their brand logo by chance, you\u2019re making a mistake. Various studies have depicted that the human brain associates different shapes with certain characteristics and emotions. Here\u2019s a list of examples that will help you to understand this psychology of web design better way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Triangles and Squares<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Shapes like this represent balance and stability, professionalism, power, efficiency, strength, and masculinity.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10132\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/logo-delta-airlines-1.jpg\" alt=\"logo delta airlines\" width=\"334\" height=\"209\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Delta and Microsoft both use triangles and squares in their logos. It helps in establishing the feeling of efficiency and stability through their logos and thus, bringing positive feelings to associate with these brands.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ellipses, Ovals, and Circles<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Shapes that fall under this category can be used to give positive emotional messages attached to unity, community, relationships, love, friendship, and femininity.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10005 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/att-logo.jpg\" alt=\"web design psychology for At and T\" width=\"336\" height=\"224\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Being a wireless network, AT&amp;T used this circular pattern in its logo that helps the brand to convey a universality feel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Horizontal Lines<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Such shapes are usually used to represent calm, tranquility, and community.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10006 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/HRC-logo.png\" alt=\"psychology in web design\" width=\"237\" height=\"237\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Being a civil rights organization, choosing rectangles or horizontal lines to design its logo, the Human Rights Campaign did a great job. It perfectly represents peace and building community. Also, the shapes used in it help to communicate both tranquility and equality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vertical Lines<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To represent aggression, strength, and masculinity, you can use vertical lines in the web design. Check out the logo of SoundCloud.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10007 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/soundcloud.png\" alt=\"psychology in web design\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the perfect amalgam of the cloud shape and vertical lines that helps to communicate the duality of the strength of Soundcloud as a tool along with the creativity.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step5\">5. Color Psychology In Web Design<\/h2>\n<p><i>The right choice of color can make or break a brand!<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Well, I already know how roses of different colors represent different emotions, right? I know red roses represent love and romance; white roses represent spirituality, new starts, marriages; orange roses\u2026 well, no, you can simply google that if you don\u2019t know. I am not here to talk about the color psychology of roses! Better to move forward with our concern regarding color psychology in web design.<\/p>\n<p>So, just like roses, different color tones used in website design convey different messages to their visitors. According to experts,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i>On average, product assessment takes only 90 seconds and between 60% and 90% of this judgment is made on the color alone!<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So, to make your web design user-engaging, you have to put effort into understanding the website color psychology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Blue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to color psychology in web design, the color blue is used for representing security, trustworthiness, calmness, honesty, care, and strength.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve seen how Facebook has used this blue color scheme to convey the message to its users that it is a strong and secure social network. Most corporate businesses prefer to use this blue color scheme while designing their digital presence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Orange<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This color conveys a message to be sociable, happy, affordable, and friendly.<\/p>\n<p>If you look at the digital presence of HubSpot, it seems Orange is their favorite color. Also, it goes well with the purpose of the website as it communicates to their audience sending the message of being happy to help their customers with better marketing approaches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Purple<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nostalgic, creative, and imaginative &#8211; these can be represented with Purple color the best.<\/p>\n<p>Kaleidoscope is an app that assists its users to do easy and quick file comparison when they need to merge changes across different versions. The purple-colored theme goes well with the app\u2019s nature i.e. helpful and imaginative<\/p>\n<p><strong>Yellow<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Confidence, logical, forward-thinking, optimistic, and playful &#8211; Yellow represents these kinds of emotions.<\/p>\n<p>For the best example, you can check out the app Bzzy. With this app, when you are busy, you can easily auto-reply to your friends. The yellow-colored scheme here helps this app to communicate its creative style while maintaining a bit of playfulness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Red<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Using color Red in your web design, you can communicate to your users being bold, active, passionate, lovable, exciting, and energetic.<\/p>\n<p>We all know how popular the brand Coca-Cola is, right? Well, being an energetic and exciting product, they made the right decision to use this red-colored scheme to represent their brand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Black<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Black represents luxury, sophistication, authority, formal, and seductiveness.<\/p>\n<p>212 Supercars is a sophisticated and luxury car rental and driver service provider. To communicate its exclusive and luxurious branding to the audience, they used the black-colored theme.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Green<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Whenever we see green, we automatically think of fresh, growth, earth, natural, and organic.<\/p>\n<p>This is why to highlight a connection to freshness and nature, Whole Foods used a green-colored scheme.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Multi-color<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Positive, multi-channel, bold, boundless, and playful are some emotions that are represented by a multi-colored scheme.<\/p>\n<p>What can be a better example than Google that uses this multi-colored scheme!<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step6\">6. Using Space In Web Design<\/h2>\n<p>Well, in the case of website designing, how well you are using the \u201cspace\u201d plays quite a significant role to make the web design well acceptable and successful. It is a popular style used by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/web-design-new-york\/\">leading web design companies in Casablanca<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I understand that when the market is full of competitors, we all want to stand out by showing the best shots we have got in our pockets. Thus, sometimes we end up putting everything we know on a page to flaunt how good we are at designing or putting up innovative things to enhance the digital presence. When a page is full of graphics, CTAs, words, blinking things, etc., it feels very congested, chaotic. This makes a web page cluttered and not recommended for web design.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLess is more\u201d may sound like a bit clich\u00e9 these days, but if you can follow it by its true meaning, designing an impressive web page is not that hard.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10009 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/spacing-in-web-design-1.png\" alt=\"psychology in web design for font\" width=\"961\" height=\"185\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You probably know that \u201cwhite space\u201d gives the breathing space to web design; it visually gives a resting place for your site visitors. Properly used white space makes a website design popular among its visitors by sending overall good vibes to them, and a message that you are easy to work with.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step7\">7. Typography And Font Psychology In Web Design<\/h2>\n<p>Well, the image below explains it all. No matter how well-written your message is, the wrong choice of font can kill your web design!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10011\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/importance-of-font.jpg\" alt=\"psychology in web design\" width=\"473\" height=\"476\" \/><\/p>\n<p>According to a general market survey on website design trends, over 95% of information on the web is in the form of written language.<\/p>\n<p>Also, experts say that optimizing typography means you are optimizing accessibility, readability, usability, and overall graphic balance.<\/p>\n<p>So, here are some tips to select the right typography for your website content.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When you use too many fonts, all of them fight for attention! To prevent it, keep the number of fonts used at a minimum.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Well, users are more familiar with standard fonts and they can read it faster. No, I am not saying you can\u2019t play with fonts to create an immersive experience or to meet branding purposes. But using standard fonts has its benefits.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Opt for a typeface that works well in different sizes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Use such a font where each letter is distinguishable.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Try to avoid long lines.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 All caps texts \u2013 a big NO.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You should make good use of color contrast<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is better to avoid coloring text in green or red.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Do not use blinking text for your website content.<\/p>\n<p>Well, which typography to choose depends a lot on your target audience and the type of message you are trying to convey to them as well.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"step8\">8. How to Integrate Web Design Psychology in Your Website<\/h2>\n<p>So far, you got to know what psychological factors to be considered while designing a user-engaging website. Now, the question becomes, how to incorporate all these into your site.<\/p>\n<p>Get started with the following smart and effective tips.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: You need to figure out your target audience<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on your target audience, the website design can vary.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if your target audience is tech-savvy and internet veteran, they are more likely to have a different priority set than someone who goes online only to look at their grandchildren\u2019s photos on Facebook!<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Your web design should give your audience a homely feeling like they are in safe hands<\/h3>\n<p>If your target audience is homemakers or mothers, you should use soft color tones, more family pictures, and lesser statistics! On the other hand, if you are targeting bankers, you should use more content featuring figures, numbers, money, and businessmen.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Try to keep things simple<\/h3>\n<p>A cluttered web page gives a feeling of untidiness. Hence, it is advisable not to go overboard with too many design elements in one page. Try to keep it simple and concise so that your visitors can easily navigate the available website pages.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Maintain consistency throughout the website<\/h3>\n<p>Making the most out of repetition is a smart move to design great websites. Well, this doesn\u2019t mean I am telling you to repeat the same information! I am talking about repeating elements. If you use the same elements throughout the web design, it can help your visitors to expect a consistent experience throughout your site. Also, it looks very professional.<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up<\/h2>\n<p>So, if you\u2019ve reached this far while reading, I can safely assume you already have got an in-depth idea of how to use psychology in web design. Well, to be an expert in web design, you don\u2019t necessarily have to be an expert in psychology.

Search indexes and engines came into being to help users locate relevant information amidst the huge text floating across the web. The growth of the web from dozens to millions of pages required automation. Web crawlers and some of the search engines started their journey in the meantime &#8211; such as <b>Yahoo, Alta-Vista<\/b> <i>(from July 2013 they have ceased all their operations)<\/i> etc.<\/p>\n<p>Yet another project on open-source web search engine called <b>Nutch (brainchild of Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella).<\/b> They were after a way to return the web search results faster simply distributing the data across different computers to accomplish multiple tasks at a time. Google also came up with their search engine project based on the similar concept, simply sorting and processing the data in a distributed manner, and automating the way. In the year 2006, Cutting joined Yahoo and took along with him the Nutch project.<\/p>\n<p>Today <a href=\"https:\/\/hadoop.apache.org\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Hadoop <\/strong><\/a>is the framework and ecosystem of technologies managed and maintained by the non-profit <strong>Apache Software Foundation<\/strong> <i>(ASF, which is a global community of the software developers and contributors operating since 1999)<\/i><\/p>\n<h4>BENEFITS OF HADOOP \u2013 HARD TO IGNORE<\/h4>\n<p>With huge data volumes and space, stuff increased varieties of social media to Internet of Things (IoT), are some of the key considerations. However, some other benefits of Hadoop are\u2013<\/p>\n<p><b>Computing Power<\/b> &#8211; It helps to distribute the computing model and quickly process big data.<\/p>\n<p><b>Flexible Service<\/b> &#8211; Compared to the conventional relational databases, you no longer need to pre-process the data before you store it. You can store as much as data you feel and take the decision later on how to use them.<\/p>\n<p><b>Fault Tolerance<\/b> &#8211; If the node goes down, jobs automatically redirect to make sure the distributed computing does not fall short. It automatically starts storing multiple copies of a data.<\/p>\n<p><b>Affordable Cost<\/b> &#8211; This open source framework is free and uses the commodity hardware to store huge quantities of data.<\/p>\n<p><b>Scalable Operations<\/b> &#8211; You can easily grow the system simply adding more nodes and requires very little administration.<\/p>\n<h4>HOW CAN HADOOP BRING SUCCESS TO YOUR BUSINESS?<\/h4>\n<p>As per <strong>Forrester Research<\/strong>, 60% of organizations points towards the increased revenue, and improving their strategic role in business initiatives within next 12 months.

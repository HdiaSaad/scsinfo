Women love green, blue and purple. They hate brown, orange and gray. Most of us are always under the impression that pink is a color that woman are in awe with, but that is wrong.

This is the most widely used color today on the internet. Every website you come across and most of the social media pages are using blue color. The reason is that this color has a psychological effect on the mind of the visitors. There is an element of trustworthiness and serenity that one associates with this color and hence, blue is so popular among all brands. However, do not use the color in any website that deals with food.<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\" start=\"4\">\n<li><b>Use Green For Promoting Outdoor Products <\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Green is one of the most call-to-action colors. It creates an urge among visitors, thus forcing them to take a look at the website. Though most of the time, you will see the color being used in a website that sells eco-friendly products such as refurbished items or any products that are organic in nature. However, one can also use it intelligently as this can be used creatively. For instance, if you have an e-commerce website, then you can use the color in the call-to-action buttons such as \u2018Add to Cart\u2019 or \u2018Submit\u2019<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\" start=\"5\">\n<li><b>Black Spells Luxury<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, use the color to reflect opulence, royalty and add sophistication to the look of a product. What most of the customers look for in a website that offers high-end products is the sophistication that it can offer to them and no color is better than black, when it comes to describing the royalty associated with a product.<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\" start=\"6\">\n<li><b>Use White <\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This might sound to you a bit old school and traditional, but white is one of the most powerful design features. The use of white breathes life in a website. It indicates freedom and spaciousness at the same time. Hence, if you want to use this feature on your website, then do not hesitate to do so.<\/p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is a larger audience on the internet these days and millions of websites are coming up every now and then, with the right color strategy, one can definitely win over others.

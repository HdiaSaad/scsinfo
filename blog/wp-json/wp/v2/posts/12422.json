But more often than not, these practices do not bring in expected results. What might be the reason for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main problem is the fact that most of the time clients come in with the idea that web design and web redesign are the same processes. The familiarity with one assures them of familiarity with another process, and that produces problems. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a sharp variation within <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website redesign challenge<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and normal design challenges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both procedures are very contrasting from the inside. And that\u2019s why I with my team have created this guide that intends to clear out the confusion and provide an in-depth understanding of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to redesign a website<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Stock Of Your Website<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the thing about<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> redesigning your website<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211;\u00a0 it starts with an already existing and functional site. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not a \u2018build-from-the-scratch\u2019 mission, rather \u2018fix-the-problematic-area\u2019 mission. And to do it right, the site has to be inspected first. And that\u2019s why this is the first step of this <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website redesign guide<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll find plenty of issues when inspecting the site. These areas undoubtedly need to be fixed. Now based on the website, you\u2019ll find various issues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>During my experience in running a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/web-design-new-york\/\">web design company in Casablanca<\/a>, I have gathered information that can help you make the decision the right way.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is a list of some basic complications that happen to every site.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Pro Tip:<\/strong> There are plenty of good analytics tools out there like Google Analytics,\u00a0 Google Pagespeed Insights, GTmatrix, etc. Use these to get a full idea of the state of the website.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A. Lack Of Parallelity\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every business has a unique identity. And the design needs to reflect it seamlessly. A lot of business owners looking for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">affordable website design<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> forget to count in the matter of business identity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then disaster ensues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though initially your site matched with business identity, later on, it might not. The identity of the business can change as it grows, and the site design needs to change accordingly as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So take a look at the site and consider if it matches the business identity. If it doesn\u2019t, then it is time to change it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B. Where Are The Results?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of reasons for a business to have a site. From escalating revenue generation to getting traffics. But at the end of the day, only one goal matters, and that is- to make the business more successful.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So when analyzing the old website, ask if the website bringing in the kind of result expected? If not, then put the site through inspection and pinpoint the problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is going to be an important part of the entire <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website redesign strategy<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.

The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">modern website design trends<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> change regularly, and most successful ones out there are keeping up without any problem.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the site was designed in early 2010 and carrying the same design since then, it\u2019s high time for a redesign. Backdated designs cause both aesthetic issues and technical issues, rendering the site unusable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D. Issue With Engagement<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good website is always appealing to its users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When considering a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website redesign<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> think about whether the website is attracting the users. Inspect the web content, images, information structure of the website. If it is failing to engage and excite the visitors, then it is time to change it all.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E. The Bounce Rate Dilemma\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This issue puts a lot of sites in jeopardy. The more people leave as soon as they enter the site, the bigger problem will be.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There can be plenty of reasons for users to desert the site. These reasons can range from misleading page content to slow website. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever it might be, the website analysis stage can determine these reasons and help in finding solutions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outline The Website Redesign You Want<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Website redesign<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fixes the problems of the site as well as adds more elements to it.

After acquiring the basic idea of what needs to be changed, go on and list out what needs to be added to the websites. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The requirements might be different based on the type of trade. but the basic requirements for a successful website remain the same. And if the website is lacking any of these, then add it to the list of requirements ASAP.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Pro Tip:<\/strong> For the <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website redesign process<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, conduct a market and competitor inspection.

And the site needs to reflect this change perfectly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the redesign process, it is necessary to evaluate the previous goals and then change them when necessary. The changes occur depending on client demographic, changing industry scenarios, and the size of the business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s crucial to consult <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">local website designer<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before redefining the objectives and diving deeper into the process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.

All the results and statistics collected go into the design phase, which can be divided into a few steps.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The design phase is divided into four parts. And sure these often overlap but having clear and precise knowledge can ensure that the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website redesign process<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ends successfully.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Wireframe creation<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the first stage.

Blockchain Impact On Solar<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At this point, we are all familiar with the concept of distributed\/decentralized database, a.k.a blockchain. Popular for its bitcoin application, blockchain is now changing the solar industry as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Until now, there have been two breakthroughs in the use of blockchain in the solar industry. The first one being easy P2P trading of energy. And the second one being the reduction of fraud in the corporate trading of solar energy. Let\u2019s look at these in details-<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">i. Peer To Peer Trading Of Energy<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the significant breakthroughs is blockchain&#8217;s use for P2P power trading. And the blockchain experiment, funded by the Australian government proved this. With this process, homeowners were able to sell the leftover energy produced from the domestic solar fixtures in a localized manner. They were able to set their price and trade at will.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13133 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-824x1024.jpg\" alt=\"digital transformation of the energy sector solar\" width=\"824\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-824x1024.jpg 824w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-242x300.jpg 242w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-768x954.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-1237x1536.jpg 1237w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-1649x2048.jpg 1649w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Despite the negative sides, such as irregular prices set by individuals, this method has proven to be worthy. With this digital transformation method, individuals can now settle their funds faster. Earlier they would have to wait a certain period of time for their electricity bill and feed in traffics to settle. Now with blockchain, that process can be done almost instantly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Additionally, the ability to release tokenized funds upon meeting specific terms is another great benefit of this technology. The use of blockchain will help you to remove transactional friction easily for the solar organization. So don&#8217;t forget to pay attention to blockchain benefits when planning a transformation for your organization.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. Efficient Validation &amp; Certification<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Corporate accountability is pushing companies to be more eco-friendly. As a result, more business leaders are trying to implement solar solutions in the business process. However, the use of clean electricity does not always mean eco-friendly. And that&#8217;s why solar companies are using blockchain certification for every unit of energy they sell.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With the use of blockchain, solar power suppliers and corporates are building a transparent business relationship. Solar companies are using blockchain to provide a smart contract with every unit of power a big corporate buys. This way buyers can validate the certificate of origin. This use of blockchain in the solar digital transformation will help you fulfill the business objectives of going green.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">c. IoT Taking Solar To The Next Level<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Unlike the traditional energy sector, the solar industry needs to use remote methods to generate energy. Most of their main pieces of equipment are usually on the field, facing the best and worst of nature. However, the IoT applications in the solar energy sector make equipment maintenance a lot easier.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The positive impact of IoT on the energy sector also includes reducing the complexity related to power grids. The cloud-based data gathering process helps to monitor various on-field gears in real-time. You can access the data from a centralized control panel easily, and take necessary actions. The IoT collected data can also be used for advanced analysis and preservation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\">Read Also: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/enterprise-software-development-trends\/\">Confused about different enterprise software development trends?

But have you considered being Agile during the transformation efforts?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/digital-transformation-in-manufacturing-industry\/\">The right kind of digital transformation strategy<\/a> helps global industries survive, sure. But sadly, very few look beyond the digital aspect of it. It is not just a matter of integrating technology solutions in the business. There&#8217;s more to it than what meets the eye.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And for this more aspect, you need the assistance of the Agile method.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Focusing On A Singular Digital Aspect Might Be A Mistake<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">What is digital transformation?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The basic idea is all about the adoption of digital technology to remodel the old business process. There are many reasons why business owners think it is important for the business. Some of these are- enhancing the consumer experience, reaching business goals, and beating rivals easily.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is important to embrace and make use of new technologies to improve the business process. But it is still not the make or break aspect of such efforts. Going digital means creating a business process that delivers value to the clients. It should also help the business to keep on growing exponentially. However, focusing on only the technological aspect of digital transformation trends is not the way to do it. And this is where agile methodology comes in.<\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\"><strong>Did you know?<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/blakemorgan\/2019\/09\/30\/companies-that-failed-at-digital-transformation-and-what-we-can-learn-from-them\/?sh=711ca9cd603c\">In 2014, Ford attempted their hand at digital transformation<\/a> with Ford Smart Mobility, a new business segment. However, the attempt soon failed because the transformation was treated merely as a separate new venture. But they should have reinvented their entire business process.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2 id=\"id_2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Agile Methodology &amp; Digital Transformation Consulting: A Perfect Match?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The traditional digital transformation strategy is not enough to keep up with the evolving digital panorama. With the legacy transformation, you&#8217;ll be stuck in a static one department at a time process. And when you finish, it will be time to update the solutions altogether, again.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13088 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"825\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match.jpg 825w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match-300x229.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match-768x586.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To leverage all the benefits of new technology, you need a flexible and all-encompassing plan.

And to keep up with such multiple aspects, you need the agile approach.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/agilemanifesto.org\/\">four principles of agile<\/a> have already proven to be helpful in business process transformation. Whether it is utilizing new digital transformation trends or ensuring the flexibility of digital solutions, agile helps businesses in the long run.<\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\"><strong>Read Also<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/enterprise-software-development-trends\/\">A special read for you! Peak into the enterprise software development market, and take note of the newest trends that will reign in 2021!<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2 id=\"id_3\" style=\"text-align: left;\">How We Turn Digital Transformation Agile?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Agile helps us to soften the rigidity of legacy transformation models. It also ensures the longevity of the solutions in supporting any business venture of our clients.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But how do the principles of agile help with forming the digital transformation roadmap? Here&#8217;s how we apply the four principles of agile and enhance the transformation experience for our clients.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Principle 1: Transformation Based On Necessity, Not On FOMO<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first agile principle demands that we pay more attention to the people &amp; interactions rather than tools &amp; processes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This principle puts importance on the team members involved in the process. Rather than focusing on tools and methods, we rely more on individual expertise to form the digital transformation strategy for our clients<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Surprisingly, even now, many digital transformation endeavors are taken up due to Fear Of Missing Out. Young entrepreneurs are continuously pestered with buzzwords such as IoT, AR\/VR, Cloud computing, etc. To stay ahead of the curve, business owners often integrate these solutions without thinking twice. However, such spur-of-the-moment decisions can cause further problems in the future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The combination of digital transformation and agile ensures that the process beings value to our clients. Our initial discovery &amp; research focuses on what kind of results the people involved in the process are looking for. Rather than get distracted by buzzwords, we concentrate on empowering our clients with a sensible plan.<\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\"><strong>Expert speaks:<\/strong> Digital transformation is not a simple integration of digital solutions, but changing your business to meet the new world business expectations &amp; goals. So before undertaking such a process, make sure you have some serious goals set and ready to be fulfilled.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Principle 2: Enabling Hands-On Transformation That Helps To Achieve Results<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Earlier, the focus of any development process was on creating thorough documents. But with agile, this focus shifted more towards continuous delivery of working solutions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Agile focuses on faster development and making changes based on client reviews. With this, the developers can create market-ready digital solutions in a lesser amount of time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Similarly, the use of the agile principle helps our digital transformation strategy to achieve goals faster. Rather than holding meetings after meetings, we begin with a basic understanding of the business requirements and the expectations of the end-users. Then as we progress, we make the changes based on hands-on reviews.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our goal is to improve business methods with transformation efforts as efficiently as possible. And that is why we don&#8217;t base our process on assumptions. We aim for a more educated, review-based system, making changes according to client opinion after each development sprint.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Principle 3: Collaboration Methods For Better Tech Integrations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Successful transformation is not just about technical integrations. It is also about creating an organic link between our expert teams and clients.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To sustain the entire process and ensure the right results, we aim for an open and harmonious relationship with our clients. This helps us to understand their needs in-depth and search for growth possibilities. And for this, we use the latest communication tools, staying in touch with our clients constantly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13089 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/For-the-Collaboration-point2.jpg\" alt=\"digital transformation consulting and tools\" width=\"825\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/For-the-Collaboration-point2.jpg 825w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/For-the-Collaboration-point2-300x228.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/For-the-Collaboration-point2-768x584.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our digital transformation consulting services are aimed to help entrepreneurs every step of the journey.

Here\u2019s your sneak peek into our development process for better understanding!<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Principle 4: Responding To Changes With A Fluid Transformation Plan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sometimes flexibility is needed to make a set of plans more effective. And that&#8217;s why we use the fourth principle of agile, which is- \u201cresponding to change over following a plan\u201d. Here are some positive impacts of the application of this principle.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">1. Making Changes Becomes Faster &amp; Easier<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Digital transformation is not a monolithic occurrence. It is a continuous process that uses technical solutions to achieve business goals. This is why we need to pay close attention to the evolving tech scenario and make changes to the plan effectively.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13091 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan.jpg\" alt=\"digital transformation consulting strategy\" width=\"825\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan.jpg 825w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan-300x229.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan-768x586.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The combination of digital transformation and agile helps us to focus on new changes within the plan rather than follow the old and strict rules and documentations.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Scaling With The Business Growth<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Businesses tend to grow and change requirements more often than you think. Such new variations usually happen based on trends, altered customer behavior, and business growth. However, to accommodate such changes, a modified digital transformation strategy is necessary.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Additionally, the existing digital solutions need to be flexible enough to adapt to the times. In such a scenario, the agile approach helps us to create solutions that scale with the business as it grows.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Pivoting Made Easy<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Lastly, beginning with a set plan is good, but it also needs to be flexible. Unforeseeable changes happen all the time during the R&amp;D process, and a flexible plan can help with that. The fourth agile principle helps us to create a flexible plan that accommodates any sudden changes at any time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And that&#8217;s how the four agile principles help us to digitally modify our client&#8217;s business. Now, before finishing off, let&#8217;s look at some major reasons why we choose this approach.<\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\"><strong>Read Also:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/digital-transformation-for-ecommerce-client\/\">Wanna see an example of our work?

This combination has a grounding effect on the otherwise lofty concept of hyper-business-automation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Let us tell you about some major reasons why we prefer this approach when remodeling your business digitally.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Keeping Everyone Motivated<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our agile digital transformation roadmap puts the people involved in the project first. This empowers them to fulfill tasks with increased motivation. Additionally, this approach leans a lot on the personal and collaborative expertise of the team. This makes members feel responsible beyond the set tasks and keeps both the team and clients motivated to do the very best.<\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\"><strong>Did You Know?<\/strong> The majority of digital transformation attempts fail because of a DIY mentality. To really make the process a complete success, make sure you collaborate with proper experts who can bring added value to the transformation attempt and help you achieve all your goals.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Delivering Value Continuously<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Traditional transformation efforts yield results over a longer period. However, those results can be ineffective sometimes. But our agile approach delivers continuous value that always measures up to the expectations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We apply the agile mindset while creating a digital transformation strategy as well as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/website-design\/\">design and development solutions<\/a>.

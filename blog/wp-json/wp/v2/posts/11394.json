With real estate apps like Zillow and Trulia in Casablanca and California, the real estate industry is one step closer to digitization, helping to make the complicated process of home buying easier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A. Better for mobility<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is it going to be easier for users to use their smartphones for property browsing?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer is yes. They are using their phones for every other task anyways. If you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/how-to-make-an-app\/\">make the right app<\/a>, users can look for property on the go with these apps. There\u2019s no need to visit every prospective house and location they see fit. They can check out the details of the house or the apartment from the app and visit if it matches their requirements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B. Location centric<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a geolocation feature on every smartphone and that m2akes it easy to make location-centric searches.

Providing Better Customer Support<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real estate business is a complicated one, but if you create your own real estate app, you can ease the pain. The clients need proper customer support to actually get through this. And an app is going to be the perfect tool for that. The features such as constant and direct connection with the clients are going to make it easy to build a healthy relationship with the clients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E. The Direct Marketing Facility<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real estate apps are the best instrument for directly marketing your business to the clients. There is no interruption of a third party or spam. Not only it will bring in more clients and therefore more business and revenues, but it will also keep the clients engaged with your business.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">F. Stand Out Among The Competition\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an app, you will get a better understanding of your clients as well as stay updated with the popular market trends. Not to mention, with a specialized app for buying and selling property, you will be able to stand out in the market and get more clients easily.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we have validated the idea of real estate app development, we need to talk about the two distinct types of app you can build.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Know_the_app_types\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2nd Brick: Know The App, Know The Types<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you hire any freelancer or real estate app development company, you need to understand the app types.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to mobile app development for real estate, there can be two types of apps depending on how they function. The first one is an agency based app, and the second one is a third party app. How these apps function? Let\u2019s see-<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A. The Agency App<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The agency app, just like its name, belongs to the specific real estate agencies. Working as the digital face of the business, the agency app lists all the houses under their listing, has all their agents listed for easy access of the users.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the agency app, the agency can keep track of their business improvements, how many clients are engaging with their agency, and what their demands are. It is basically an improved tool for business management and improvement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B. The Third-Party Model<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third party or the aggregator model works as the mediator between the buyers and the agents. The workings of the third party model is a little different than the agency app.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The users can sign up either as buyers\/sellers or freelancer agents. The freelancing agents can upload their own listings and expand their network through the app.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The user, on the other hand, can contact the agents nearby, browse through their listings, look for houses they are interested in.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sellers can sign up and contact the agents about the property they want to sell. The third-party app basically becomes a platform for the agents and the buyers\/sellers to easily and instantly communicate.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have decided on the app model, the next step is going to be planning the right real estate mobile app features.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Plan_out_the_app_features\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3rd Brick: Planning the Futuristic features<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like manners maketh man, the features maketh an app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that\u2019s why you have to be careful about picking the right features for your app. The right real estate mobile app features can help your app become more functional and useful for the users. You can also go for a whiteboarding session with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/mobile-app-development-new-york\/\">a reliable mobile app development company based out in Casablanca<\/a> to get the feel of the market. So what kind of features does your real estate app need? Here is a list-<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A. Login\/Signup<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By signing up the users can create a personal account where they can save various information and preferences, search histories, etc. There are a few ways this feature can be implemented-<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The users can sign up using their mail ID or phone number. It is also important that you implement the social media signup feature. With this feature, the users can sign up using just one tap. Make sure that the app is easily accessible from the login\/signup phase.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B. View\/Edit Profile<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the ability to create a profile, the users should have the ability to view and edit their profiles as well. The users can add and edit their details, search histories, preferences, etc. This feature will not only let them personalize their profiles but also make their app experience better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C. Filter &amp; Search<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The users are going to use various keywords to look for the right property. This means that your app is going to need a robust search and filter feature.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_11441\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-11441\" style=\"width: 1650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-11441 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property.png\" alt=\"create a relate estate app with property searching feature\" width=\"1650\" height=\"1276\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property.png 1650w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-300x232.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-768x594.png 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-1024x792.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-11441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Real estate app designed by Unified Infotech<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The search feature needs to be incredibly accurate so that the users don\u2019t have to search too long for a location. And to make it more accurate, you need to add a filter option as well. With this option (also present in Zillow mobile app), the user can filter properties by location, prices, type, ratings, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D. Mapview<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For property searches, the map feature becomes incredibly important. With this feature the user can easily navigate new locations, routes, look for specific landmarks near the properties, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_11442\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-11442\" style=\"width: 1650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-11442 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/real-estate-app-feature-map-view.png\" alt=\"create your own real estate app with map view\" width=\"1650\" height=\"1276\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/real-estate-app-feature-map-view.png 1650w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-300x232.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-768x594.png 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-1024x792.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-11442\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Created by Unified Infotech<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another unique way of integrating the map feature is through heatmaps. With heatmaps, you can display proper distribution of data about things such as crime rates in the neighborhood, traffic flow in the locality, population density around the property, etc. To integrate the heatmap feature,\u00a0 you\u2019d need to consult Google maps documentation for information on heatmap utility for android apps, and for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/ios-app-development\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iPhone app development<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you need to consult the displaying overlays on a map in the iOS developer library.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E. Property Details<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next is property details. Of course, the users need to know all the details about the property before expressing any kind of interest in it. In the real estate app Zillow or Trulia, you will see houses needs to have the below-mentioned details listed to attract the interest of the buyers-<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How old the house is?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the condition of the house?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What the offering price is?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The location of the house<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long the owners have lived there.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many times the property has changed hands in the past.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A brief history of the property.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without the property details section, no buyer will show any interest in the property, so make sure that the details section is clear and detailed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">F. Reviews &amp; Ratings<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ratings and reviews are other important features that your app needs. With this feature, the users will be able to leave their reviews on the property after viewing, about the agents on the platform and help the other users to understand the quality of service they can get from the app.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">G.

With the image gallery feature, sellers and agents can upload detailed images of the property to attract even more clients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">H. Social Sharing\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With most people on social media platforms today, it is necessary that your app includes a social sharing feature as well. Because through social sharing, the sellers and agents can share a property listing on the social media platforms and get more interested buyers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"How_should_be-the_UI\/UX\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4th Brick: Interior Decoration for the App: the UI\/UX Design<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decorating the interior of a house is important, so is the UI\/UX for real estate mobile app design.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s the UI UX of a real estate app that is going to keep the users engaged in your app. They would move on from the app if they don\u2019t like the design and user experience.

Easy Navigation Pattern<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The navigation flow of your app needs to be easy to understand, almost intuitive. The users shouldn\u2019t have to scramble through your app to find what they are looking for. So make sure that the transition from one point to another on the real estate app is easy and smooth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E. 3d Walkthrough And Floor Plans<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An added bonus to the image feature, 3D walkthrough, and floor plans would help the buyers to get an actual understanding of the floor plan, how the house looks from the inside and whether it matches their requirements or not.

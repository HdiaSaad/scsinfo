The brick and mortar stores come lively in this part of the year as they decorate their stores with ballons and many other decorative items. Carrying the same philosophy forward, even online retail stores are going a step ahead in order to make their website look as if they are in a celebration mood. With less than a week left for the big day, retailers are preparing for the big day with their unique sales strategies. After doing an intensive research, we have come out with some e-commerce sales strategies that will help you earn the maximum revenue during Christmas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before we proceed further, we would like you to know that Rjmetrics, a research company found that e-commerce revenue reached the maximum during November and December in non-holiday months, apparels, accessories, and computers are the products that mainly drives holiday sales. Moreover, it also found out that Black Friday generates more revenue in comparison to other shopping days of the year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Strategy I &#8211; Give Your Website A Christmas Makeover<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just as you watch the stores decorated with mannequins of Santa Claus, Christmas trees decorated with colorful lights as you walk through the streets, in the same way, give a complete makeover even to your <a href=\"https:\/\/unifiedinfotech.wordpress.com\/2015\/09\/28\/online-shopping-is-the-buzz-in-the-upcoming-holidays\/\" target=\"_blank\">online store<\/a>. Make use of festive colors such as red, white, green and yellow in order to make your website look more attractive. Make use of buttons and links and make it more interactive. Your homepage is the first thing that appears when a user opens your website. Hence, keep the home page as attractive as possible. Go for Magento based themes and make your store look creative and unique. You can also take the help of a designer who works in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/ecommerce-website-development\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>e-commerce web development company<\/strong><\/a> to get an idea about website design during Christmas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Strategy II &#8211; Announce Free Delivery On All Products<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you really want customers to keep coming back to your website especially during Christmas, then follow the golden rule of announcing free delivery on all your products or if you can also announce a special free delivery offer for purchasing a particular product above a specific price then nothing works better than this. It is ok to sacrifice a bit of margin in order to get the maximum return from the purchases.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Strategy III &#8211; Make Your Page Keyword Specific<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want to get your website noticed especially during Christmas, then make sure that the keywords are optimized according to the most searched items during this time. Merely inserting keywords won\u2019t solve the purpose, use the appropriate keywords in headlines related to Christmas.

Strategy IV &#8211; Take Advantage Of Last Minute Shopping<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if there is only a week left for Christmas, then don\u2019t worry, you can even announce the last minute shopping offer now. All you have to do is ensure that you deliver the product to the customer before Christmas. Remember, the trend of an increase in sales starts from the Thanks Giving Day and it continues for many days. Hence, you can continue with your Christmas Campaign and get plenty of orders from customers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. Strategy V \u2013 Take the Help of Social Media<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spread awareness about the special Christmas offer through social media whether it is Facebook, Google+ or Twitter. Let the word spread among everybody. Blog about Christmas and any other thing related to gifting ideas.

Moreover, solve any queries or problems related to the product and the customers will surely come to your website.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6. Strategy VI \u2013 Take the Help of Paid Marketing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During Christmas, people tend to scroll more than a million websites in order to find the best Christmas deals. If your website has the best deal to offer, then don\u2019t limit yourself in terms of marketing.

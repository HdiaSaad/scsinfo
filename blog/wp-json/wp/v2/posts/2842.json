Moreover, to define them we can chalk down the two popular quotes to define these two separate entities&#8230;&#8230;.<\/strong>First, \u201cDo what you love and you never have to work a day in your life?\u201d (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Confucius\" target=\"_blank\">Confucius<\/a>) and the later,\u201d You are not supposed to enjoy it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called work.\u201d (Unknown)&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p>Whether you agree or disagree let&#8217;s move on with the topic.<\/p>\n<p>If we ask you if happiness is important in the workplace &#8211; What you may reply? \u00a0Well, it is up to but for the people working at SCS INFO Pvt. Ltd happiness in the workplace is a type of contentment of the position you hold in your career ladder. <strong>Searching for happiness at work<\/strong> is essential to keep you glued to the job for a long term.<\/p>\n<p>Is happiness important for <strong>job hoppers<\/strong>? Job hoppers, for them we wish there hopping do not end. However, to their astonishment it does end with no place left to hop neither any energy to hop, simply retire. (Though, most of us cannot afford to retire for different circumstances.)<\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>\nRead More:<\/strong> Are You a Serial Job Hopper?<\/p>\n<p>While other work towards retirement, the Team UIPL work towards finding solace and happiness in the workplace. Here is a simple guide that helps us to wear that broad smile at our workplace. Let us be the messenger and share our wisdom to help you realize the happiness within workplace.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Happiness is Important<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cI left my previous job because I wasn\u2019t happy\u2019<\/em>, then make sure you find happiness in the next job. May people list\u00a0remuneration, benefits, perks, status and career goals as the factor in deciding which job to apply. When people look for a job they search for happiness, as it is a prime factor, but in the midst of their job hunting is severely overlooked. (<strong><em>Team UIPL members were also guilty of it once<\/em><\/strong>.)<\/p>\n<p>Keep &#8220;happiness&#8221; in the top of your list of priorities, not only for your future employers but also for yourself. It is not something silly, it essential to look for a job that is productive and rewarding. The workplace can be a competitive environment, filled with goals as long as you know what you want to achieve to make yourself happy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Work with People You Want to<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some people are able to light up the space simply with their presence in the workplace. They make people optimistic and every word that comes out of their mouth fills us with confidence, it is good to know a person backing you up in case something bad happens. This is a person, whose door is always open, and you can bring up anything for discussion such as if you require a resolution, you can find it in the person.<\/p>\n<p>Some call them \u2018mentors\u2019 in fact they can be anyone, your manager, team leader, and sometimes, if you are ever so lucky, it may be your <strong>BOSS<\/strong>. If you have transfixed goals, respect will act as a magnet. So it is good to work with people respected or admired by many, including yourself, perhaps this will let you find the utopia that help you spend 9-to-5 in the workplace.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Working with People Who Have Our Back<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is hard to take instructions from people who are weaker than you when it comes to a voice of authority. It is important to work with someone who will know your back. Simply making categories of people such as \u2018friends\u2019 and expecting them to watch out for you is not enough. You should be able to depend on the team members and even your team leader. <em><strong>Team UIPL closely believes in this.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>This kind of safety-net works as a great stress buster and contributes greatly towards your well-being in the office. The trick is to find people in the environment you dwell. What you may need is to take time and spread some goodwill to pay attention. Well, we do not disagree that workplaces come with hellholes and if you are into one, it is probably the best to relocate happiness in some other workplace.It is better to <strong>QUIT<\/strong> and find a job that makes you have your <strong>SMILE<\/strong> back.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Workplaces Where Emotions Never Deemed as Weakness<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Just ask anyone &#8211; <em>\u201cAre you passionate about your work?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You cannot talk about being passionate in the workplace if you want everyone to stay professional and ignore his or her emotions all the time. Denting your anger, suppressing the frustration and opting for a state of professionalism will only leave you tense and uptight and will affect your health to some extent.<\/p>\n<p>We are humans and do emote, whether we like it or not. However, instead of hiding emotions, we must try to control it. It is better to steer your emotions\u00a0as control is something more rigorous. We must channel it to something positive rather than suppressing it and you might feel surprised where you end up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Strong Attraction of Comparing Lives<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most common form of human trait is to compare lives with others. Maybe for this trait the online retail stores are making some good fortunes. Comparing where you are now with a former classmate or current friend, though knowing that about every circumstances, you are comparing apples and oranges, sometime it may be apples and basketballs (People who do not even belong to same category yet feel like comparing).<\/p>\n<p>Some companies pay high remuneration and expect you to give up a lot of your personal time to stay in employment, others might pay less but do not get you in trouble with your spouse or partner by calling you up during your family holidays. Even you can come across typical companies who help to sort out your problems so that you can deal with the problems in the company (but they are rare). There are also traditional types of offices that do not allow you to mix the business with home affairs.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever maybe the policy, remember you stay employed by someone to achieve their goals, not vice versa. Do not add stress deeming yourself less worthy when you get into a comparison with someone. If you really want to compare it is better your compare to yourself. Compare the current \u201c<em>you<\/em>\u201d with \u201c<em>5 years down the road<\/em>\u201d and find out what you need to improve or what you hope to achieve 5 years from now?<\/p>\n<p>It better to underline a saying in this context, <em>\u201cA man who views the world the same at fifty as he did at twenty has wasted thirty years of his life.\u201d <\/em>\u2013 <strong>Muhammad Ali<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Leave Job for Something Great <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is the greatest lesson that we would love to impart to the world out there, you must resign from a job as you have found <strong><em>something good<\/em><\/strong> in some other job, but rather you found <em><strong>something great<\/strong><\/em> in it. This is going to make your nerves steeled and determined to settle for nothing less than great.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you succeed or not is a great mystery, since life is full of adventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Final Words<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If these tips or wellness points sound the \u201ceasier said than done\u2019, then sorry we beg to differ. You might notice in many productive and job-seeking articles or career-based blogs, advice columns or motivational stuffs we are hardly encouraged to associate with happiness.<\/p>\n<p>Well,\u201c<strong>rewarding<\/strong>&#8221;\u00a0or \u201c<strong>conducive<\/strong>\u2019 or some other buzzwords are not going to make up the infrastructure of happiness. It is high time that you must closely think what resorts to happiness at your workplace. We at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/\">UIPL<\/a> have resorted about what make us <strong>HAPPY<\/strong> and live as a family bonded closely at the workplace.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>GUYS its now you TURN!<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Work and enjoyment are the two opposite poles.

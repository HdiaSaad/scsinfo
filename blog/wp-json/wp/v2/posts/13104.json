People went to work, and work-from-home was almost unheard of. No one knew such a thing called social distancing existed. In January of 2020, our design team found itself at a crossroads as to what to do.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In short, we were feeling stuck. Our team had been making major strides in terms of design work, but we felt we needed a little more vision. Something that would fire us up to the Design Hall of Fame. We were aiming for the stars.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After hours of thinking and overthinking (yes, we creatives keep doing that), we decided that a design sprint was the answer. Or was it? That\u2019s what we thought, at least. We had lovely visions for our future. Collaborative creative teams working on a product together. Aah, art!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But as our design head began to plan out various stages of the design sprint process, an impending disaster started to loom in our world.\u00a0 A strain of the novel Coronavirus had made it to the US, rapidly spreading across different continents.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In a couple of months, we learned that the entire world was going on lockdown. Social distancing and quarantine were strict norms we\u2019d have to abide by. At Unified, as with many other organizations worldwide, the need for remote work was instantly felt. Work from home was now the \u2018new normal.\u2019<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So as creatives, what were we supposed to do? Call it quits? That wasn\u2019t an option. How would we brainstorm for hours on whiteboards? Was it possible to carry out remote design sprints? As it\u2019s now clear, it was.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here\u2019s how we did it.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">1. What Is A Design Sprint?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But first, a brief introduction for those who are new to the design world.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Made famous by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gv.com\/sprint\/\">Google Ventures<\/a>, design sprint activities have been fairly popular in the industry for quite some time now. Basically, a design sprint is a simple framework that helps translate abstract design ideas into testable, real products.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As the name suggests, a sprint focuses more on speed and efficiency than perfection. Plus, it\u2019s much more collaborative in nature.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sounds complicated? We\u2019ll make it easier for you. What you do is put a group of talented designers, developers, and product managers in one room. You tell them to finish the design and only then, come out outside. We\u2019re serious.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The conventional design sprint somewhat resembles a double-diamond structure. Every stage corresponds to each day of the design process.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">These stages are, namely: Mapping, Sketching, Defining, Prototyping, and finally, Testing. Here\u2019s what it looks like:<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_13105\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-13105\" style=\"width: 2134px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-13105 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/1-01.jpg\" alt=\"Remote Design Sprints\" width=\"2134\" height=\"1663\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/1-01.jpg 2134w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/1-01-300x234.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/1-01-1024x798.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/1-01-768x598.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/1-01-1536x1197.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/1-01-2048x1596.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-13105\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: abstract.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To sum it up: a design sprint is a five-day process that gives you, the design lead, ample time to answer some of the most pressing questions. What will be your design and branding strategy? How are you going to test your model?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Design sprints are like the \u201cTop 50 Hits\u201d of your business and web design strategy. Whether it\u2019s design thinking, customer psychology, or innovation, you can just bottle all these up in a concise plan for your team to use.<\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\">Related Read: Learn more about our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/branding-and-website-design\/\">5-step branding process and design strategy here<\/a>.

And we\u2019re not gloating!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Instead of waiting for your first prototype to launch and figure out if it\u2019s any good, you can use design sprints as your short cut route to launching and prototyping.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you ask us, design sprint planning is a superpower that few have.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot like a time-machine: you can just fling yourself into the future and see what your design ultimately looks like. Besides, you can gauge how your customers will feel about it before making errors that are too expensive.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And, and, and, you can also avoid this:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_13106\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-13106\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-13106 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/design-sprint-meme.png\" alt=\"Remote Design Sprints meme\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/design-sprint-meme.png 600w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/design-sprint-meme-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/design-sprint-meme-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-13106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/35hZdTC<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2 id=\"id_2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Warming Up: Running Remote Design Sprints<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Design sprints are the stuff of legend. We mean, just look at <a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/intl\/en-in\/\">Slack<\/a>. Or <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/\">Medium<\/a>. Or <a href=\"https:\/\/nest.com\/\">Nest<\/a>. Pretty much every tech giant in the world has signed up with Google\u2019s design sprints venture or some other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/\">web design company<\/a>. It\u2019s helped them enter untapped markets, gain millions of customers, and ultimately transform marketing as we knew it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So here\u2019s what you need to do before you run your remote design sprint:<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">a. Read THAT Remote Design Sprints\u00a0 Book<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you\u2019re a web designer, you\u2019ve probably heard of Jake Knapp, Google\u2019s former Design Lead. And that book he wrote. The book that changed how we worked in design. It\u2019s called <a href=\"https:\/\/g.co\/kgs\/xdxjA7\">Sprint (How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days)<\/a>. If you\u2019ve never been part of a design sprint before, you need to read this book. Like, really read it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And please don\u2019t skim read. Read every part of the book. Love it, smell the pages (no, we\u2019re kidding). But it helps if you give it a thorough run through and make notes to yourself. The book includes some excellent design sprint challenges that\u2019ll help you nurture your creativity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before you ready yourself for the big day, it\u2019s imperative that you take a close, hard look at all the activities and refresh your ideas. In most likelihood, you\u2019ll have a lot to balance, so reading the book will help clear the ground.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">b. Devise A Plan<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Every project that was successfully executed had some great planning to back it. Before you run your design sprint remotely, just fixate on some essential tools, you\u2019ll need. Here are some tools that we suggest you use.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.figma.com\/\">Figma<\/a> for design storyboarding, wireframing, and finally, prototyping<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mural.co\/\">Mural <\/a>for chalking out your ideas on a virtual whiteboard<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack for all kinds of asynchronous communication and messaging<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Meet, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams for real-time video conferencing, communication, and meetings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Besides these, there are many other options that your team might prefer. Whatever they are, make sure to list them neatly in your calendar or schedule. Also, add meeting codes to any digital space you might use.<\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\">Pro Tip: Set the same access code everywhere. You don\u2019t want twenty people calling you up every other second begging for the code.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">b. Preparing Your Design Sprint Tools<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Secretly, we kind of thanked COVID-19 for all that work-from-home. No more Post-its, flyers, easel pads, new markers to worry about.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It\u2019s gotten so much easier now with virtual whiteboards like Mural or, if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, artboards in Figma. Besides these, there are several other offerings that you can use as your canvas, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/in\/products\/xd.html\">Adobe XD<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sketch.com\/\">Sketch<\/a>, or Adobe Photoshop.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sure, you\u2019re going to miss the smell of fresh marker ink or stickers clinging to every part of your workspace, but that\u2019s a small price to pay for freedom, really.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Post-COVID, several brands launched remote design sprint kits, but you can keep it simple with the tools you already know.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just make sure you remind them to buy pens and paper in advance. In case they need it for sketching out their design solutions on something tangible.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">c. A Nice Cozy Workplace for Remote Design Sprints<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This one\u2019s kind of a dream. As designers and creatives, we all want our work desks to look absolutely Instagrammable. Cozy nooks, natural light, planters, and the perfect cup of French-pressed coffee. But no, that\u2019s not going to be the case with remote design sprints.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Virtual whiteboard, schedules, sketches, phew&#8230;all this is going to make it impossible for you to have that super gorgeous work desk. But you can always go back to it once your design sprint\u2019s over. Can\u2019t you?<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_3\" style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Going Into The Battlefield<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Until the COVID pandemic struck, the general consensus was that design sprints are best conducted offline. That\u2019s because these are incredibly energy-consuming processes. It\u2019s highly collaborative in nature, and back when things were normal, the sheer busyness would overwhelm us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">People rushing around, chasing Post-Its, sketching ideas in a frenzy. You get the picture. Trying to shift it online would then mean complete and utter chaos. Well, we don\u2019t think so.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The most significant factor that determines how successful your remote design sprint is time. When it came to offline sprints, time was in abundance. You could take four to five days and work at your pace. Remote design sprints: that\u2019s a whole different world. We suggest two to three days at max.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To give yourself enough time to think, make sure to conduct all your research before running the sprint. If you\u2019re the project lead, ensure everyone does their bit of research. Things like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/user-experience-design-and-usability\/\">usability<\/a>, user experience, and customer challenges should be of prime importance.<\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\">Also Read: Take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/digital-transformation-for-ecommerce-client\/\">how we revamped our client\u2019s eCommerce website<\/a> with stunning design thinking.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">a. Day 1: Mapping and Sketching<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As Jake Knapp famously said in his book, \u201cThe structure allows the team to \u201cboot up\u201d as much information as quickly as possible \u2014 while preventing the usual meandering conversations.\u201d The idea of a design sprint in itself is very efficient, and once you get down to work, you can come up with ideas quickly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Launching your design team into the Mapping phase on the very first day is a great idea. Take a look at all the things that you need to do, such as:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">i. Asking Your Design Experts<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. Work To Be Done<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iii. Grouping Affinities<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iv. Execution<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">By the end of the day, you\u2019re going to have some great ideas, ready to be sketched. Dive into the sketching exercises and make it a truly collaborative team effort. To translate your sketches into reality, you can use an iPad or even Miro\u2019s remote design sprint templates. If you don\u2019t prefer Miro, you can always switch to a <a href=\"https:\/\/design-sprint.com\/remote-design-sprint-template\/\">Google design sprint template<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When it\u2019s finally time to call it a day, you\u2019ll have tons of creative design ideas waiting to be full-fledged product solutions.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">b. Day 2: Defining And Deciding<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not every idea is going to make it to the testing phase. Testing and launching are extremely time and money-consuming processes, so you\u2019ll have to fixate on any one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here\u2019s what we suggest you can do: divide your team into smaller groups and decide on your options. Vote on the ones that seem most promising. Debate and define what you want from your design, and then finally, you can zero in on one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When you have your winning design in hand, you can create a step-by-step storyboard. Sketch out how users are going to interact with your product. Whether it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/website-design\/\">web design<\/a> for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/mobile-app-development\/\">mobile apps<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/ui-ux-design\/\">UI\/UX design<\/a> for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/ecommerce-website-development\/\">eCommerce website<\/a>, outlining a skeleton will go a long way.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You\u2019re now at the end of your remote design sprint\u2014time to follow up with prototypes and testing.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_4\" style=\"text-align: left;\">4. The Afterparty in Remote Design Sprints<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So your remote design sprint\u2019s over. Congrats! You made it! Now go thank your colleagues and teammates for the amazing work they\u2019ve done. Collaboration, as they say, is the key to all great creative work.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13117 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-rfstudio-3810754-1024x731.jpg\" alt=\"Remote Design Sprints afterparty\" width=\"1024\" height=\"731\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-rfstudio-3810754-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-rfstudio-3810754-300x214.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-rfstudio-3810754-768x548.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-rfstudio-3810754.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But you\u2019re not done with things yet. After the end of your two to three-day remote sprint work, it\u2019s time for some design sprint user testing. Once your design team rushes off to turn the storyboard into reality and a workable prototype, you\u2019ll have to launch user testing sessions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is the part where you expose real-world users to your prototypes and see how your design fares. There are chances it could turn out to be a complete failure but keep your fingers crossed.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_5\" style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Weaving Magic<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There was a time when if you told someone you were about to run a remote design sprint, they\u2019d have scoffed at you.\u00a0 Not anymore. Digital sprints are here to stay. They are not just workable, but very useful too.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13116 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-startup-stock-photos-212286-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Remote Design Sprints magic\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-startup-stock-photos-212286-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-startup-stock-photos-212286-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-startup-stock-photos-212286-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-startup-stock-photos-212286.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If your design sprint turns out to be successful, well, good for you. Whatever the outcome, a little retrospection is going to do you a lot of good.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">What was most valuable? Which part of the process did you most like? Is there a different approach you can take? How is the customer experience going to turn out like?

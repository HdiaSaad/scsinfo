Primarily used for paintings and other artworks, design principles have now entered the domain of web design as well. These principles that have helped so many artists create groundbreaking work of arts are now helping web designers to create web designs that are not only functional but beautiful as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 1000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/public-media.interaction-design.org\/images\/uploads\/user-content\/1445\/T1dSG5N4ZdaaBrqyOVGMOI3Fe9JoeBg24XwQybAQ.jpeg\" alt=\"web design principle basics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"613\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Interaction Design Foundation<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These design principles are applied to optimize the design that is best suited for the service you are designing the website for. Through the use of colors, space, and content, a skilled web designer can turn a website into a work of art; a work of art that can generate some serious revenue for your business and easily convert site visitors into clients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So why is it important for you to apply design principles in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/services\/web-development-company\/\" target=\"_blank\">website development<\/a> project? Let\u2019s take a look at that.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importance Of Design Principles For Your Website<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Application of design principles is undoubtedly important for any web designing process. However, these importances are not just the design of a beautiful website. Below we have mentioned the six importance of design principles in web designing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Creating A Design Methodology For Your Company<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first and foremost importance of the application of design principles is creating a design methodology for your company.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A design methodology means having a set approach to web design. With the help of your design methodology, you will have a clear way of approaching any kind of web design project. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This clear path will guide you to optimize the design of the website depending on the user base, the client\u2019s preferences, and the industry you are designing it for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than scrambling around with too many ideas and concepts and getting confused with the market trends, you can get clear guidance about all the web design elements with design principles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Creating A Design Understanding Within The Team<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are working with a design team, everyone will have their idea about what works and what doesn\u2019t.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some of our clients, the use of lighter colors would look good, while some website needs darker colors to suit the design better. Some may speak up in favor of larger than necessary fonts, while some think that smaller fonts look more elegant. And needless to say, this kind of dispute makes it hard to work and create a good enough design for a website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is why design principles are so important in web design. With these principles, you can create a design understanding within your team, and figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t. The principles of web design are based on tried and tested design experiments done by experts. When you follow the design principles, there won\u2019t be much dispute among the designer team about the various design elements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Help With Client Feedback<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a common practice for the clients to give back feedback on the design you have created for them. However, these clients may not be as proficient in design terminologies as you or your design team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is why having a clear set of design principles that you follow described on your company website will be enough for the clients to know what they can expect from the design done by your design team. This way they can provide clear feedback on what the design lacks than giving vague feedback that\u2019ll only confuse you further.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Creating Design Solutions That Help The Client\u2019s Problems<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two websites never have the same design. These designs change depending on the user base and the kind of industry you are designing for. Of course, the designs of a restaurant website and healthcare website is never going to be the same.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the design principles, you can create tailored web design solutions for your clients depending on the industry and the user base.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Building A Better UX For Site Visitors<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ultimate aim for any web designers is to create a better User Experience for the web site visitor. It goes without saying that with a better UX, the client will have a better chance of converting the visitors into potential consumers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UX of a website is not only for converting the website visitors it is also important for the reputation of the website. The visitors are not going to engage with a website that has a poor UX. additionally, for the site visitors, the UX of a website tells them how much the service provider cares for its clients. So you must apply design elements to build a better UX.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Improve Conversion Rates<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It goes without saying that with a better UX, you can get better conversion rates. When the users become satisfied with the website design, they would engage more with it, such as signing up for the newsletter, click on any other kind on the CTA button you might have available on your webpage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 6 Web Design Principles Followed By Us At Unified Infotech<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at Unified infotech, we are well aware of all the major importance of design principles in web design. And that is why we always stick to the principles of beautiful web design that never fail to help us to create a well-optimized website design for our clients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important for us that the designs we deliver are not only aesthetically pleasing but functional as well. And that is why we abide by the below-mentioned principles when it comes to design.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Less Is Better (application Of Hicks-Hyman Law)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have all heard of the rule less is better, or less is more. But did you know that it is based on a scientific experiment by William Edmund Hicks and Ray Hyman?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.interaction-design.org\/literature\/article\/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hicks-Hyman Law<\/a> predicts that the more options you offer the user, the more time it will take for them to make their decision.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are designing the website, the more options and choices you include, thinking that you are being detailed with the design, the more time it will take for the users to make a decision. The more time it takes for the user to make a decision, the more confused and fed up they will get with your website, and move onto some other website where they don\u2019t have to think too much to make a choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/5336775-Digital-Healthcare-Platform\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/VEyyDMTUX89R819pBQi4-pZBP5lGeoXfqvlNA2FOYD7k6sEPFoTG5OqydtfXHFjxMQH0xWE_M95ElusmU8IvprfJeq6hmuLn0oLctbJFmzqujLbP7nEZ6fEfokxnsE7B-e9SdwA\" alt=\"dental chat\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">How we designed this Dentalchat website<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this is why at Unified Infotech, the application of Hicks law is a common design practice for us. By reducing the number of choices on the websites, we make sure that the visitors make quick choices without wasting time and yet, choose wisely for themselves. Like in the above example, the number of choices to a minimum of three. This way, the site visitors won\u2019t have any problem choosing an action to perform on the website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Negative Can Be Positive (use Of Negative Space)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another reflection of the \u201c<strong>less is more outlook<\/strong>\u201d is the user of negative or white space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The white space is the blank space on the website. The spaces between the website contents are called the negative spaces, and they might seem useless, but they are there to serve a purpose.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An overly complicated web design, that is loaded with too many elements, is sure to make the visitor confused and annoyed. When there are too many elements on the webpage, it leaves the users confused about all the contents on the webpage and which one they should pay attention to.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 1600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/hrimlcHNDw0S0o9kv0Vfbb6yU61syqSisoiReVostkQBPKTH4yLrnEcJa_jnxX49Anj7YUsdr53lmMjiy2lPQWZpMhUbgk-TvSWVT1tAg6gyj1e2YVMEZ23KU7_-tpGYOJtvpxw\" alt=\"web design principles we followed\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">We used negative space design principle<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the above design created by us, the use of white space is evident. This design is not only functional, keeping the focus of the user on the main content of the page, but it is also aesthetically pleasing. We use the negative spaces to break up the content into smaller chunks for easier consumption. With negative space, the design not only becomes aesthetically pleasing but easy to consume as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Optimal Placement Of CTAs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main aim of any website is to convert the visitors into clients. And the best way to do that is through Call to Action buttons. But to make CTA buttons work, they need to be placed in core visual areas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the best website design principles, we apply the rule of the third for the optimal placement of CTA buttons. Like in the below image,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the <strong>rule of thirds grid system<\/strong>, the CTA button has been placed near the top horizon line. If you are familiar with the rule of thirds design principle, you will know that the objects placed near the horizontal or vertical lines or at their junction engage the focus of the viewer faster than the ones placed in the middle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We not only stop at the application of the rule of thirds, but apply other design principles such as the golden ratio, and fitts law to make sure that the CTA button brings the desirable we expect.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Colors And Contrast: Neuromarketing Rule Of Visual Hierarchy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Color and contrast play a huge role in the application of the concept of visual hierarchy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The matter of visual hierarchy is one of the important ones in web design principles and elements. According to the principles of effective web design &#8211; the elements of the web page need to be designed and placed according to its importance, to engage the focus of the viewers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And to engage the focus of the viewers, or rather enforce the visual hierarchy, colors and contrast are used as tools. Let\u2019s look at the below example for a moment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the above image, you can see the perfect use of colors and contrast to enforce the matter of visual hierarchy. The top text that explains what the website is for, is written in bolder and bigger font than the other texts. The contrast of size makes sure that the focus of the visitor would go straight to the top text.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, the use of color, the trustworthy blue, along with bright and popping yellow for CTA buttons, makes it an interesting, vibrant and engaging design\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To provide the users with the best designs, we apply the rule of Neuromarketing, selecting the perfect color for the product. Applying tried and tested color and contrast theory, we make sure to create a design that subtly nudges users to choose that website than any other. With the principle of color and contrast in web design, we aim to create a positive impact on the site visitors, helping them to take the desired actions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Familiar Actions, Familiar Design<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All websites on the web follow some familiar patterns in their design when it comes to performing any kind of action on their website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the placement of the logo on the top left side of the page to the use of familiar terms for the menu bar, we apply Krug\u2019s first law of usability, which is- \u201cdon\u2019t make the users think too much.\u201d with the use of familiar design elements we aim to provide good website design for our clients. Take the below image as an example.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 1600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/portfolio\/ui-ux-gallery\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/sHVHnM6Ji9ooZLi3Lyz482VZbE2BeNWLsm964QiA8fYJw0UNAusGeqtqae9PwHMHGt0J2T0SWntckC2-QQ3cKfgMXWNlodyoV2HyFyrlFAdzN80sRAEfFyu0UOZu2pIJ40eSAJc\" alt=\"web design principles at Unified Infotech\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">We used familiar Actions, Familiar Design for Laundry application<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The above image serves as a great example for the application of the law of usability. The screen consists of an easy and simple design. The logo is placed right where the visitor expects it to, so they won\u2019t have to search the screen to find the name of the company. The menu uses familiar terms rather than using funky terms which will make the users think about what will happen when they click on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The principle of familiarity keeps up with the familiar practices of website design. Rather than trying something shocking and completely out of trends, we go with familiar actions and practices. And that is why we recommend using familiar colors and brand faces in the design to increase familiarity and empathy of the user. Through this, the users feel more close to the brand and become more prone to engage with the website.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Consistency Of Branding<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consistency of branding is something we adhere to no matter what. We keep the colors, images, and contents, including both images and text, consistent with the brand. Consistent branding makes it easy for the site visitors to engage with the brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consistent branding approach turns an average website into a storytelling journey for the users. The first impression it makes lasts longer, turning it into a memorable experience for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to website development, the design is a big aspect of it. And when it comes to the design of a website, there are many ways for you to choose. And just like it said in Hicks Law, too many options is only going to confuse you and waste your time. That is why following the tried and tested design principle is the best way for you to begin your web design journey, just like we did. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our list of effective web design principles helps us to create designs that make for successful products.

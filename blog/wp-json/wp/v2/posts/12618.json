Sans the support of an appropriate leader, carrying out the project efficiently, and within the preset time frame becomes a genuine hurdle.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this regard, it serves better if there is a CIO, supported by a strong leader-led team. Furthermore, it also helps if the digital transformation of businesses as KPI exists. This sets the margin between a successful and unsuccessful digital transformation fro enterprises.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 5: Integrate the Various Digital Culture and Train the Staff Among the Brand<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A crucial part of digital transformation is educating and training the staff across organizations.

These include &#8211;<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encouragement for employees for solving problems.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The enterprises are responsive and better connected across is various departments. This ensures that employees can adapt quickly as per the changing customer requirements.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees are willing to take risks. In case such risks lead to breakdowns, they learn from the failure to make sure that similar mistakes are not repeated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Know this &#8211; the best practice for digital transformation include &#8211;<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aligning staff for the beginning<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking through the customer\u2019s perspective<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Synchronizing the efforts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leveraging the latest digital technology}<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">True that technology is core to the digital transformation procedure, it is inclusive of technology, but not conclusive to it. The perfect, final dish would need a sprinkle of culture and dash of talent that transforms an enterprise into its best digital version.

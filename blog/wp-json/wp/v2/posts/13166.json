Game on! We are in! Our goal? Well, while we were brainstorming for ideas for our year-end articles, one particular idea stood out.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For the last decade or more, we have crafted products that cater to our esteemed clients and their specific industry verticals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We often choose one between Frost\u2019s \u201ctwo roads\u201d- either the right product or the right way to build a product, unknowingly. The idea here is to bring on a face-off between the two approaches. Post this, you will need to decide upon which of the two creates the most appeal and asserts the most efficiency.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While the thought is truly fetching, the narrative too will require some fine-tuning here. So, here is what we think of building a perfect product or building the product right.

The Pandemic Product Market for 2021 &amp; Beyond<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It might be safe to say that never have we been this keen for a year to end like that of 2020. The year was an eclipse (with none of the aesthetic view) in itself. It brought in a multitude of nosedives in the business, financial, and career openings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, due to the novel pandemic, people are often opting for remote work. This led to a significant surge in the product development industry.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">More and more organizations picked up their pace in the second half of the year. This was in an attempt to minimize the losses and meet up with their minimum cash-flow situation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As a result, they leaned more towards innovation. This brought in to products that were relatively unique as compared to that of their competitors. The target was to capture the user\u2019s attention and then convert them from being prospects to becoming clients.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One such innovative edge added to product development involves the digital transformation aspect.<\/p>\n<div class=\"related-post-box\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"related-post-box-item\">\n<p class=\"title\">Bonus Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/digital-transformation-strategy\/\">How We Digitally Transform Your Business For 2020 &amp; Beyond<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The second half of 2020 witnessed some serious acceleration in the digital transformation endeavors for products. Some such transformed products even saw double-digit growth during this phase. Here is a detailed look into this aspect of product development.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_2\" style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Product and the Digital Transformation Approach<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Truth be told, digital transformation is no \u2018new kid on the block\u2019. From Cloud Infrastructure to Platform-As-A-Service, the integration of digital transformation into products brought in commendable results. These results are visible across diverse industry genres that include the manufacturing, medical, and P&amp;C industries.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A. <strong>Manufacturing industry\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this industry, the digital transformation approaches (as explained in our article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/digital-transformation-in-manufacturing-industry\/\">Digital Transformation In Manufacturing<\/a>) brought in hybrid products. Such products led to the perfect combination of the traditional gating procedure and the software development process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">B. <strong>Healthcare sector<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With the digital transformation creating waves across all industries, the medical industry refused to fall behind. As a result, came the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/healthcare-application-development\/\">healthcare applications that have become a necessity for 2020 and beyond<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">C. <strong>Miscellaneous<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Like the sharks in the major industries, the relatively minor ones like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/liquor-and-wine-ecommerce-marketplace\/\">Wine Business too went on to be Technology-driven<\/a>! This digital transformation-stricken product development-based awareness was possibly the most desired one across 2020!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now, there is an ongoing debate on the approach to software development process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One camp sternly believes in building the perfect product that caters to the clients, while the other concentrates on the right process to build the product. Here\u2019s a look at what these two camps of product management for services look like &#8211;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13171 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-02-2-623x1024.jpg\" alt=\"software development process\" width=\"623\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-02-2-623x1024.jpg 623w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-02-2-183x300.jpg 183w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-02-2-768x1261.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-02-2-935x1536.jpg 935w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-02-2-1247x2048.jpg 1247w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-02-2-scaled.jpg 1559w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While the image merely showcases the tip of the iceberg of this debate, it\u2019s time to delve into the details!<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_3\" style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Building the Right Product<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The groundwork involved in developing a product is a mammoth task in itself. Why else do you think a Project Manager goes berserk?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, why again did we start focusing on the PMs? Well, they are a key angle to this topic. Considering the role they hold in projects, they are the ones who decide upon whether<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">i. Develop the right product or<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. Build the product right or<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iii. Strike the perfect balance between the two alternative roads.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But how do these tech wizards handle the decision? Here\u2019s a look into their factors of consideration while going for the right product building &#8211;<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">A. Research<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first set of questions that crowd the PM\u2019s mind before building the right product are &#8211;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">i. Is this the problem that we should be targeting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ii. Is the issue worth the time and effort that my team will be putting in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iii. Considering that we identified the issue and developed the product, is this the right product? Will it meet the initially targeted issues of the user?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">All of these concerns need to be integral to the research. And these help to validate any potential solutions and various business issues.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13172 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-1-1024x995.jpg\" alt=\"software development process\" width=\"1024\" height=\"995\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-1-1024x995.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-1-300x291.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-1-768x746.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-1-1536x1492.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-03-1-2048x1989.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Such research can be the root of a diverse range of solutions. However, it is essential to understand its very nature first. Research, as an element of building a perfect product, can be of various types &#8211;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">i. Competitive analysis<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. Prototyping solutions<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iii. Shadowing individuals engaged in the work<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iv. Reading documentation<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">v. User interviews.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">B. Users<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To build the right product, one of the priorities is the user-angle. Catering to the user\u2019s requirements, as product developers, you need to start understanding your users, their perspectives and ensure that the required product is focused on resolving the user\u2019s issues.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">However,\u00a0 one prominent hurdle is that more than often users are unable to articulate their issues. It then becomes the Product Manager\u2019s responsibility to articulate the issues for the product owner to understand better.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is followed by the-<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">i. Spotting of high scopes and<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. Use of high-quality research resources and<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iii. Use of analytics to seek the most suitable product-based solutions.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">C. Product Owners<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A product owner is as, if not more, important to a product development team as the PM. So, what is a product owner?\u00a0 He\/she is entitled to make decisions about the product with the assistance of the PM.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Have you noticed how they handle the crucial decisions about the product? Additionally, they have a crucial role to play in the success or failure of a product. These key \u2018stakeholders\u2019 hold deep domain expertise that helps them make crucial decisions.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">D. Priorities<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">How many times have you heard the word \u2018triage\u2019? That is while you are watching medical TV shows like The House, The Good Doctor, The Residents, or Chicago Medical?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Do you know what that means?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Well, theoretically, triage is the assignment of degrees of urgency to wounds or illnesses. This helps medical personnel to decide the order of treatment of a large number of patients or casualties.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">By now you understand the crucial role played by the person who calls this shot, right?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the case of the right product development, the PM handles the digital triage. It is the PM who decides in which order the queued up problems are to be solved. This means taking into account the right balance among cost, value, and risk calculation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With so much down the line, our proficient PMs have chalked out their roadmap across this prioritization. Here\u2019s a small sneak peek into it &#8211;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">i. The priority is the high-value parts of a product. De-risk the areas and spot the unknown issues.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. Take into account the technical challenges across the product.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">E. Analytics<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, the right product service management you offered to the clients has been launched. But, your job as a product developer and launcher doesn\u2019t end there. You will need to continue to build the right product even after the launch.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Analytics helps one achieve this. Additionally, in case your launched product isn\u2019t the right one, you can fine-tune it with analytics.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Such analytics requires an optimum setup. One needs to decide what is the perfect set of questions regarding data. This tooling needs to be a business requirement based and the outputs have to be actionable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before adding on to the analytics, make sure to decide upon &#8211;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">i. The product-based queries,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. The plausible answers,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iii. The customization of products as per answer-requirements.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">F. Scopes<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, let\u2019s see &#8211;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Issue identification &#8211; check!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Solution offering &#8211; check!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The solution adopted by the user &#8211; Ummm\u2026<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, here is the problem &#8211; the solution you offer needn\u2019t be unique. Similar solutions often pre-exist in the market. This might make your user doubtful about your offered solution as software development process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, what do you do?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">i. Identify opportunities by analyzing the market.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. Find your place across the industry.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iii. Look for your USP (Unique Selling Point).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iv. Conduct a holistic competitor analysis to identify opportunities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is all about building the right product. Seems appealing enough? But, we say, it\u2019s too early to decide. Check-in with the \u201cbuilding the product right\u201d, compare the methods, and then decide between the two!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You game? Time to hop in!<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_4\" style=\"text-align: left;\">4. Building the Product Right &#8211; The Correct Software Development Process<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With \u2018building a product right\u2019, the entire focus is on the product development process. However, the process brings with it diverse risks &#8211; this includes the risks that<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I. the developed product will cater only to the product developers<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. The product will satisfy the terms that were there at the beginning of each sprint.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With the intervention of an expert Product Manager, there are chances of balancing between the preset product goals and the technical necessities. For this to work out optimally, there are a listed number of elements that one needs to concentrate on &#8211;<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">A. Process<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Let\u2019s start by saying that the key to building the product right is leaving ample room for customization. The personalization of the development process factors the niche for the product.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Thereby, at Unified Infotech, we have created a skeleton roadmap. This roadmap helps us stay focused and ensure the efficiency of the functioning. Here is a look into the product development process followed by our expert Product Manager &#8211;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13173 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-04-947x1024.jpg\" alt=\"software development process\" width=\"947\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-04-947x1024.jpg 947w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-04-278x300.jpg 278w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-04-768x830.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-04-1421x1536.jpg 1421w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-04-1894x2048.jpg 1894w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 1: Discovery Workshop<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Approach &#8211; This preliminary stage or the product discovery process mainly focuses on a client-team discussion. This involves running the project considering the initial agreements made and the proposals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A Product Manager with his\/her team will discuss the goals and objectives of the project. They gauge the competitive landscape, target audience, market, the client\u2019s branding preference, document the preferred designs, and the epic mapping.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Result &#8211; Taking into consideration the client\u2019s opinion and requirements brings much-needed clarity to the project. As their expectations become transparent, this eases the working for the team. Subsequently, the planning phase initiates with the client\u2019s feedback and input.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 2: Planning for software development process<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Approach &#8211; It is here that the branding guidelines, design, and project plan are clearly defined. One needs to prepare the relevant documents, and take into account the client\u2019s approval for the execution of the project.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Result &#8211; A well-planned project is now on the way to efficient execution with detailed documentation in hand. Subsequently, in our product management consulting services, the list of deliverables include &#8211;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">i. project plan with detailed sprint planning,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. wireframes,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iii. test cases and scenarios and,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iv. user stories.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 3: Design<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Approach &#8211; Design thinking is building the right things. Our expert design team walks in. They start with the product designing based on the client-approved design guidelines and the wireframes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Additionally, the team also takes into account the diverse devices from which the product will be accessed. Accordingly, the team crafts design that caters to web, mobile, and tablets.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Result &#8211; Among the deliverables post this stage are &#8211;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">i. clickable prototypes across Invision platforms,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. source files in the Sketch or Photoshop format, and<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iii. the complete UI design of the project.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 4: Development<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Approach &#8211; The main product development stage is inclusive of catering to web services, backend, frontend, and API development integration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This also comprises a strategic approach to the Agile Scrum methodology with the creation of an optimized clean code structure. Our methodology of agile is about building the right things.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Result &#8211; The product is developed using the web and mobile technologies. This product may or may not be right on the first go. But, with client feedback and review, the product developed caters to their requirements and business goals.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 5: Testing<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Approach &#8211; No testing channel is left unturned. We tend to include &#8211; regression, manual, automation, unit, security, load &amp; stress, code, and performance testing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Result &#8211; A ready-to-be-launched bug and glitch-free product is developed post the testing procedure.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 6: Maintenance<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Approach &#8211; Irrespective of whether the product has been launched or not, our support and maintenance service persists for our developed product.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As a part of the \u2018building the product right\u2019 approach, our team conducts<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">i. regular security audits,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. full testing of the system to spot errors, bugs, or incompatibility.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The product is also enhanced using an agile product management approach and bi-weekly code backups are conducted. Additionally, considering that any product launch would fetch massive traffic, our team helps monitor traffic and the server load.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">They also aid in the optimization of the product as per the specific business requirements.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Result &#8211; With post-launch maintenance, the client\u2019s product is optimized as per the evolving market requirements. Additionally, it becomes bug-free and ready for multiple platforms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This process described above is the core secret to the successful projects of our PMs with the \u201cbuilding the product right\u201d approach. While this is the most crucial factor, it isn\u2019t the only one. There are multiple other elements as well! Read on to know about these!<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">B. Architecture<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Application architecture indicates achieving the simultaneous goals of executing the development for the present and planning for the future. This element is crucial. It makes sure that after the software development process, the product can be<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">i. fine-tuned,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ii. scaled, and<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">iii. calibrated<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">-to meet client requirements.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13174 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-05-1024x829.jpg\" alt=\"software development process\" width=\"1024\" height=\"829\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-05-1024x829.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-05-300x243.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-05-768x622.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-05-1536x1244.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/1-05-2048x1658.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this case, PMs offer a detailed roadmap. This roadmap would reflect all the trade-offs and all the costs involved.

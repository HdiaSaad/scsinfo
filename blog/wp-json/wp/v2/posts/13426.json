Customers have high standards and have become particular regarding their expectations from brands. So, if your website is not appealing, 38% of users will stop engaging with your content.<\/span> (Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/compelling-stats-website-design-optimization-list\">Hubspot<\/a>)<\/p>\n<h3>So, how should you build a robust website\/apps that also converts?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We at SCS INFO have helped our clients to digitally transform themselves using the best practices while staying ahead of the competition.

Now, shoppers can get a preview of products and services in real-time through the \u2018try on\u2019 or \u2018view\u2019 feature. <\/span>The beauty and cosmetic industry is leveraging the power of augmented reality (AR) to transform the e-shopping experience. With the help of AR, consumers can virtually full-fill makeup applications to mimic how they would try cosmetics on at a traditional brick and mortar store.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Power of Artificial Intelligence (AI)<\/strong> \u2013 With the help of AI, companies can deliver hyper-personalized and enriching customer experiences.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are two of the most powerful AI powered ecommerce future trends that can skyrocket your top of the funnel (TOF):<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Voice Commerce Powering CX<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Why type when you could easily voice your query? If an e-commerce store does not have a digital assistant, this can be a major drop-off point for users. They will get tired of typing out their queries as it slows down their shopping experience. An Emarketer survey revealed that 40% of internet users in the US use voice search. Evidently, businesses can leverage the \u2018voice-to-cart\u2019 technology to boost a website\u2019s engagement rate and sales.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Customer Service Chatbots<\/b> &#8211; <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer assistance chatbots can really help to convert visitors into customers. Like in-store salespeople, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedinfotech.net\/blog\/chatbot-can-use-business\/\">chatbots help consumers<\/a> complete their purchase and offer after-sales support. This is a way for businesses and emerging e-commerce companies to communicate with customers (including communication using regional languages) and resolve their issues then and there. In fact, 40% of millennials say that they use chatbots daily as they provide answers instantly.<\/span> (Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slicktext.com\/blog\/2020\/04\/chatbot-statistics\/\">Slicktext<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Big Data for Personalized Experience<\/strong>&#8211; Online stores do not have retail salespeople to recommend products or answer shoppers\u2019 queries. That is why it is crucial to have human touchpoints in a customer\u2019s journey on e-commerce platforms. To mimic a user&#8217;s personalized in-store experience, online retailers are extracting customers\u2019 information through their social media, browsing behavior, and prior buying patterns. Successful e-commerce brands are leveraging analytics to make UX data-driven and target consumers with exactly what they desire and even more.<\/li>\n<li><b>Headless Commerce: A Solution to Increase Sales<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Headless commerce is the separation of the front end i.e. the marketplace, user interface, graphics from the back-end that manages the product details and the portal&#8217;s entire functioning. This allows e-commerce website development companies being more creative, allowing freedom and flexibility to offer unique and personalized services to customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/8vZbbsCbVU8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"id_2\">2.

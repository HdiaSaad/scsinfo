										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you own a business, then having an app is the easiest and a sure-shot way of communicating with your clients, 24/7.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11132" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/business-benefit-with-apps.jpg" alt="business benefit with apps" width="1600" height="1600" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/business-benefit-with-apps.jpg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/business-benefit-with-apps-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/business-benefit-with-apps-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/business-benefit-with-apps-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/business-benefit-with-apps-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at this age of smartphone technology, there’s nothing unique about having an app for your business. Chances are more than half your competitors have their own apps as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how are you going to upsell your app? How are you going to make sure that your app outshines all the competitor apps in the market?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple, by applying one of the most robust app development technology available in the market today, which is React Native.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created and supported by Facebook. As a cross-platform <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/">mobile application development</a> framework, the React Native framework is able to develop apps for both Android and iOS. If this is not impressive enough, then let us give you 7 reasons why React Native is so popular among the developers. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Better Development Environment For Developers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the support of Facebook and a huge open-source community, it happens to be a great technology, to begin with. Based on several pieces of research conducted by R&amp;D departments of top tech companies, when compared with native technology React Native has almost equal performance in 3 very important technical aspects of an app.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allocated memory.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CPU usage.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Energy impact.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the amazing support it receives from a tech giant like Facebook, and the obvious technological superiority, there are a few more reasons why React Native is so popular. Its Hot Reloading feature refreshes the UI instantly as any changes are made. React native creates a better development experience, removing the rebuild and deploy from the iteration cycle altogether. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The React Native framework uses the Flexbox layout engine for both platforms, it means that the developers only need to learn one layout engine to develop apps for both iOS and Android. Developing apps with React Native is easy and the results are high quality. The rich and vibrant community of developers make it easy to love React Native as an app development framework</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. A Growing Framework Supported By Facebook</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The viability of React Native as a coding framework might worry you a little, as it is still a relatively new framework. But since it is being backed by Facebook to be licensed by MIT, some of the best tech minds have worked on this technology which only increases its appeal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also a sizable developing community that backs it. Along with Facebook, this community is working hard to improve the framework setting up futuristic goals and promising a better technology. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Significantly Reduces Development Time</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">React Native reduces the development time significantly when compared to native apps where you need to write two separate codebases, React Native saves development time by a whopping 30%-35%. It’s a single code base for both the platforms and then compiled into separate Android and iOS apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being an open-source project, there is a huge developer community that is working day and night to improve the framework. As a result, there are a lot of components available for the developers to use when developing a robust app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing that helps react-native to decrease the development time is the use of a state management tool called Redux. It creates one shared data layer for both Android and iOS, making it faster and increasing the chances of success. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Reduces Development Cost</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The huge savings in development time automatically leads to a significant reduction in development cost when it comes to app development. Also, having a single code base makes it more affordable to maintain and scale the application. Not only does this reduce costs, but it also enables businesses to invest the savings in other critical areas.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Offers Native Functionality for apps</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest factors for the success of React Native is that it does all the above while ensuring the apps powered by it offers robust and seamless user experience like Native Apps. even though JavaScript is not exactly as fast as a native language, React running along with JavaScript can run the most complex apps in a smooth manner. The JavaScript part of the code runs on its own thread which means it doesn’t affect the various components of the app at all.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not that easy to distinguish between apps made with React Native and Native framework. The reason is that it uses the UI structure just like native apps. Additionally, it also enables developers to write code in their native language when they have to fine-tune a specific component. In such a case the developers can easily switch to Swift or Java</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Cross-platform Compatibility</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was initially introduced for iOS, Facebook later decided to develop react-native support for Android as well. Because of its amazing capabilities and features, React Native became a true cross-platform framework which means that it can be used to develop both Android and iOS app through one codebase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is convenient to embed native codes when the developer has to integrate a platform-specific authenticity to your application. As a result, you don’t have to spend time writing two codes, you can get your job done easily.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Benefits Of Live Updates And Code Push</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best advantages of React native is the live updates and code push. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about it- when you choose to build your app with React Native, the users won’t have to go through the entire app store update cycle again and again to update your app. With the extensive use of JavaScript developers can just push the updates to the user’s phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can easily integrate Microsoft’s live update service CodePush SDK to your React Native app. This will allow you to push these live updates of your app to the user’s phone. However, the only problem with this strategy is the fact that only the JavaScript files and assets can be updated this way. Any updates on the native side of the app need to go through the app store update process. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Is It The Right Call?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are no major differences in React Native and Native app technologies in performance and user experience, many tech minds also believe that for more complex apps Native technologies like Swift and Android are the preferred option. However, one huge aspect which goes in favor of React Native is that it almost saves a 30%-35% budget in comparison to native apps, which is a big saving. So if you are looking to develop your app for both iOS and Android, React Native is surely a technology that needs good consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing all the benefits of the React Native app development framework, we too have utilized it to build some robust apps for our clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering up with one of the prominent names in the healthcare industry, we worked to create an app that will make it easier for first-time parents to take care of their children. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11133" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/happy_dna_small03.jpg" alt="happy dna small" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/happy_dna_small03.jpg 400w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/happy_dna_small03-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This complete personal guide for childcare has already helped more than 25k parents and their children and continuous to do so. And the best thing? It is developed using react native technology. The </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/portfolio/happy-dna/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">case study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the app clearly defines how we turned an amazing idea into a brilliant app, made to scale the market as well as help the users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one example is not enough for you, then allow us to talk about the execution of a video recording app that is unique and uses React Native at its core as well. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11134" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/openreel.png" alt="openreel" width="512" height="287" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/openreel.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/openreel-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature of recording video remotely from another location is definitely a unique take. And the fact that it has been created using the React Native framework makes it even better. With this app, big and small companies can capture up to 4K video from anywhere. If you follow the case study you will see all the amazing features we were able to integrate into the app with the help of React Native framework. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though relatively new, the framework of React Native, backed by Facebook, has some amazing benefits that make it so popular among the developers today. It is capable of creating an app that is scalable, sturdy and reliable. So don’t hesitate in choosing React Native for your enterprise app development. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Organizations often shun building local applications, figuring hybrid solutions will be simpler and more financially savvy to build. They wind up pushing a not responsive web application into some sort of local web outline, which at last prompts horrendous client encounter. Many organizations pick to have two separate local groups for iOS and Android rather, however that technique can be costly and frequently accompanies its own particular difficulties. React Native, then again, gives you a chance to construct performing native applications utilizing similar technologies your web group is already utilizing.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Modern, developer-friendly tooling</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The React Native gives you a chance to begin another local application venture that will chip away at the both iOS and Android. These devices are extraordinary since they let you begin assembling your application immediately, instead of investing a considerable measure of energy taking a shot at setup and design before beginning. The instruments are like Xcode or Android Studio venture layouts, so in case you&#8217;re comfortable with those, it&#8217;s anything but difficult to begin. live reloading is One of my most celebrated elements of React Native app development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tooling for both web and local applications underpins live reloading of changes, which rolls out testing improvements quicker and takes out the need to recompile and redeploy onto a gadget. Another favorable position of living to reload is that your application state is kept up. This is extraordinary for testing changes to complex streams without recreating the means each time. Instruments like CodePush make it simple to drive updates to your React Native application without going through the iTunes Connect or Google Play submission processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">live reloading is one of my most lovable elements of React Native app development. The tooling for both web and local applications underpins live reloading of changes, which rolls out testing improvements quicker and takes out the need to recompile and redeploy onto a gadget. Another favorable position of living to reload is that to keep your application state. This is extraordinary for testing changes to complex streams without recreating the means each time. Instruments like CodePush make it simple to drive updates to your React Native application without going through the iTunes Connect or Google Play submission processes.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Best of both worlds?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What we truly need is the user experience of the native mobile platforms, consolidated with the designer encounter we have when working with React on the web. There are a couple of ways we can presumably accomplish this:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Utilizing WebViews</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One probability is to utilize WebViews inside simple native wrapper applications. Attempted this couple of years back, we really believe it to be an extraordinary thought. While our execution didn&#8217;t give us the execution and scaling we needed, one can easily adapt and accompanies every one of the positives related to the developer’s involvement of the web, similar to the capacity to take the full preferred standpoint of React and the web&#8217;s fast emphasis cycle. Lamentably, because all the rendering is finished utilizing web tech, we can&#8217;t create a genuine native user experience.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Porting React to native</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Porting React to native code is likewise an incredible thought, and actually, we constructed this for iOS. This task is called ComponentKit, and we simply publicly released it yesterday at F8. With ComponentKit, we get every one of the advantages of React, particularly explanatory, unsurprising UIs. However, we can likewise exploit the energy of the local condition, with stage particular segments and refined signal dealing with, and also nonconcurrent picture unraveling, content estimation, and rendering. Also, since ComponentKit utilizes flexbox for design, you don&#8217;t have to physically position and size the perspectives in your application, so your code winds up being more compact and simpler to maintain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two or three minor drawbacks to this approach, however. To begin with, it&#8217;s iOS-only, so in the event that we need to exploit it on Android. We&#8217;d need to manufacture a different execution and show engineers how to utilize it. Also, we don&#8217;t approach any of the stuff we&#8217;ve worked on the web over React, similar to Relay. Which causes us take care of genuine issues we&#8217;ve confronted scaling our information bringing. Most critical, however, is that we haven&#8217;t on a very basic level enhanced our designer speed challenge — despite everything we have to recompile after each change.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Scripting native</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we utilize JavaScript to call into local APIs, we ought to approach all the energy of the local condition. Yet ought to likewise have the capacity to repeat rapidly and exploit some of our current JavaScript frameworks. Moreover, since it&#8217;s simply JavaScript, we could presumably influence this stack to work crosswise over stages. It sounds like all that we need, and it&#8217;s nothing unexpecting that there are huge amounts of systems out there doing this. Be that as it may, it&#8217;s really not exactly so direct.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Introducing React Native</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since React components are just pure, symptom-free capacities that arrival what our perspectives look like anytime. We never need to peruse from our underlying rendered view. With a specific end goal to keep in touch with it. In the program condition, React is non-hindering regarding the DOM. Yet the magnificence of React is that it is theoretical and not firmly coupled to the DOM. Respond can wrap any basic view framework, as UIKit on iOS, for instance.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Open source</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Facebook, our main goal is to make the world more open and associated. And we need to effectively add to that mission with open source. Respond Native is no special case. We understand that the issues we confront as a building association is not special to us, and in like manner. We need to create in the open however much as could expect. Working together with other people who confront similar difficulties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, we&#8217;re eager to open-source React Native for iOS. Android support is coming soon, and we&#8217;re additionally proceeding with full steam ahead on React for the web. Yet we need to get these underlying iOS support out as right on time as conceivable. So we can get a contribution from other people who likewise excited for the approach. React is already is a fantastic approach to build UIs for the web. Components to conceptualize UI as a function of some data. React’s philosophy of “Learn once, write anywhere” makes it very easy for developers to build native apps.</p>

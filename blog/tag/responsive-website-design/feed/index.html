A brief idea that will help you to know what do we leverage to keep your websites stay ahead of the competition.<br />
Some of our unique medical website design solutions include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We stress on the use of neat layouts and uniform navigation and keep text in colors and sizes that are easy to read and with the use of web-friendly fonts (Arial, Times New Roman, and Calibri)</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The average size of the computer screen is 1200 pixels, so we conform to the standards to improve your image presence on web.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Websites active on all browsers is the most important aspect</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We make your website compatible for all major browsers in various versions: (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome and Safari)</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Optimizing all the pages</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We optimize almost everything titles and headings, use bullet points and shorter sentences when possible and include relevant keywords as well.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Emphasizing, “Contact us page” by placing the phone number in the header of all pages website</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We stress on the implementation of a clear &#8216;Contact Us&#8217; section that is accessible from any page. Our developers install a clear call to action for Appointment Requests.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Always share obvious and relevant information</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to include the office hours, information on after hours contact, and insurance information on a medical website. We ask for it from our clients to make the websites more extended.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Help installing online appointment request forms on all pages of the website</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This feature ensures our clients to tap those leads that visit the site during off hours, at nights and on weekends. If the clinic is closed, they cannot call, but if there is a form to complete, they will obviously use it.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Allowing medical websites to have online bill pay opportunities</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People pay everything online, then why not their medical bills. People feel inclined to make payments if there is a convenient way to do it.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Security is an important aspect on which we share our due attention</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our developer ensures that any communication with the medical practice through the website such as interactive forms, online bill pay, and appointment requests stays secure. The use of 256-bit encryption and use of “https” in the domain are the primary features on which developers focus.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Restrain from the use of flash applications</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we know that flash products not supported by many devices such as iPhone and iPad. Most words and images include within them do not show up on the engine search.</p>

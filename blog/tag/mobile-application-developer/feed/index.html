										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From Mark Zuckerberg discussing free basics and encryption to Samsung announcing their new models Galaxy S7 &amp; S7 edge, Mobile World Congress, 2016 was a technological potpourri as the mega event of the mobile industry was witnessed by more than 1,00,000 attendees from 204 countries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The gala event, which was held from <strong>22<sup>nd</sup> – 25<sup>th</sup> February, 2016</strong> at <strong>Barcelona</strong> was addressed by the head honchos from various industries starting from advertising to banking. They spoke about the role of mobile in digitally transforming the world. Whether it is Ralph de la Vega, Vice Chairman of AT&amp;T Inc. &amp; CEO or Anthony Lake, Executive Director, UNICEF, the experts spoke on numerous topics like a mobile ecosystem in various sectors and many more. MWC 2016 had a bunch of other important events such as The MMIX, featuring the best DJs of the world, ESL Expo Barcelona, which pulled technological geeks to the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, there were some major announcements by mobile giants and other players in the industry which were noteworthy and at the same time the event also gave an idea to the audience about the path on which technological development is going to lead in the near future</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Nokia’s YES To Mobile</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It might sound strange but even after suffering substantial losses since the last few years and selling to Microsoft its mobile manufacturing division, Rajeev Suri, its CEO hinted on relaunching the mobile brand. He said, “We think it’s a good business model because the Nokia brand has great retention – the recognition of the brand is still very high in all the major markets. We also think that if there will be a product with the Nokia brand on it there’s an opportunity for premium on that product – clear price premium”</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><b>Free Basics, Encryption And Many More</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After having a disappointment with net neutrality in India, Mark Zuckerberg stressed on the fact that he is planning to provide more services in other forms such as laser transmissions from aircraft and installing about 10,000 old school hotspots. Apart from net neutrality, the CEO of Facebook threw light on other important aspects such as ‘The Facebook Connectivity’ mission, internet drones, solar power planes which can stay in the air for more than a month, 5G and many such interesting topics.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><b>Motorola Is Here To Stay </b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Motorola isn’t going anywhere as Rick Osterloh, President of Motorola pointed out. He said that the Lenovo acquired brand has no exit plans as of now, but is planning to come out with Moto G and Moto E. It might not be very active on virtual reality like Lenovo, but has some big plans for the future. On the other hand, Lenovo in collaboration with Motorola is already working on making the Smartphones smarter. For instance: it is working on improving the image quality of the camera. Now, that’s a great news for companies working on <b><a title="mobile app development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank">mobile app development</a>.</b></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><b>Samsung’s New Models Unveiled!</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the mega-attraction of the MWC 2016 were the latest models of Samsung – Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. Some of the key USP’s of these gadgets will be their huge batteries (3,000mAh for Samsung Galaxy S7 and 3,600mAh for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge ). Wait! there’s more. Here’s a sneak peak of the two models</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>.&nbsp;<b>Tablets Took A Backseat</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year, Barcelona rather had an unexpected thing happening as there were no Tablet launch this time. In 2010, it was the first iPad of Apple and Samsung was about to come out with their newest Galaxy Tab. Six years, later it was rather a bleak scenario at the MWC. Hope, something comes out in the next edition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>6. The Gorgeous Huawei Matebook</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With 12-inch IPS quad-HD display, finger print sensor, keyboard folio and a plenty of boosted power of 4GB or 8GB of RAM, Huawei Matebook represent style effectively combined with smart operations. With razor, thin aluminium edges similar to that of an iPad, the exterior of the Matebook is such thatx it is bound to grab your eyeballs. The finger print sensor uses the same technology as Huawei’s phones. The use of vibrant colours on the 2160 x1440 resolution HD screen is something that gives it the perfect look and lets’s you to enjoy crystal clear displays. Get a brief overview of the Huawei Matebook here</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;<b>The Rolling Robot</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Virtual Reality went up a notch higher with the unveiling of the LG Rolling Bot. It is a home monitoring system shaped like a ball which can be easily controlled from your Smartphone. A handy charging dock also allows you to take control of the robot quite easily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Mobile World Congress is a great way to keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the technological world and how it shapes up our everyday life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Incase, you are planning to visit this mega event again, then given below are the venue and time details for next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Venue: Barcelona</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Date: 27<sup>th</sup> February – 2<sup>nd</sup> March 2017</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hustle bustle on the Whatsapp, playing the Subway Surfers or sending a recent Snap by the Brooklyn Bridge with your new girlfriend on the SnapChat. Millennial mobile are power packed with features and apps, which are real time productive and let them connect the world on the go. This was the fun part, but they also love to do their banking, to submit their education loan, keep a track of their expenses all via full-featured online apps. They are the netizens and not just citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So while designing apps for the millennial you need to remember some essential thing. You need to keep few things in mind while developing the apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever platform you might choose to promote your app &#8211; iOS or Android you have to remember that your apps must garner gazillion eyeballs and downloads. Therefore, are you thinking to mint a brand new app, and then make it millennial-friendly without any second thoughts?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Who are These Millennials?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Millennial are people born in between the early 1980s to the late 1990s, they are the Generation Y, they come just after Gen-X.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why Target Milennials?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make your appear among the top ten you have to acquire 4000 downloads. It is easier to gain downloads if you target the milennials. They are the generation using Smartphones in good numbers. According to a recent survey by Nielsen 85% of the millennials, aged 18-24, owns a Smartphone and 86.2% aged 25-34 own them. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/" target="_blank">Mobile app developers</a> need to target this particular segment of the audience to skyrocket app downloads. You just need to place yourself in their shoes and see what apps you would have preferred using as a millennial. Your app will acquire certain introspection before development.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4159" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/725876787-compressor-1.jpg" alt="725876787-compressor" width="1168" height="1411" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/725876787-compressor-1.jpg 1168w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/725876787-compressor-1-248x300.jpg 248w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/725876787-compressor-1-768x928.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/725876787-compressor-1-848x1024.jpg 848w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are the three bright tips to make your apps millennial-friendly –</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Convenience is the Master Key</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apps means convenience, take for example Uber cabs app. you just tap and within no time you get a cab and you are on your way. On above of all, you can pay for the cab directly from the app. if you are a football fanatic then you cannot wait to check out the live scores of a match, so most of the users have Live Score Addicts&nbsp;on the mobile. Find something good to read, you pushed it to Pocket app to give it a read in the spare time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Millennial love to stay connected on the subway, movie theaters, in the classroom or even in the washroom of a mall. Therefore, you see app increases the user experience by tenfold. So make sure that your app excels to provide a service better than a desktop, TV, voicemails, direct mails or any other conventional medium.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Thinking About the Mundane</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Get a clear idea of the routine needs of users then build a unique feature around it. Make sure to turn it into the focus of the app. Domino’s for instance was going through a rough phase. Their cheesy products were not able to find no takers. There was an immediate overhaul of their marketing strategy. So they targeted the hungry late night millennial in no time, they build an app around this one particular feature to cater food to the hungry late night milennials. The callers love to order a pizza with a few clicks, and this idea worked and from that day, Domino’s sales never sulked. So is your app mundane?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Avoid Build Something Similar</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The app does not get high download if they find similar kind of feature compared to the other, which has something better. Common services provided by an app are not something great downloadable. It would make it to the burial ground in no time. For example, if your app only helps the user locate stores, then they will not download, since they have Google Apps or Apple maps to do it for them and using such maps are easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starbucks made this mistake by making an app to locate their stores exclusively, but it had disaster downloads. So abandon building something common, rather build something unique to target your millennial customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know some really cliche lines like</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The home is where the heart is”, or “home sweet home”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However cliche these lines may seem like, home is the closest place we have to heart. After all, it is THE place we can come back to after a long day and just take a nap!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying a house is not an easy process. You have to go through various property listings, talk to agents, sort through paperwork and complete many other duties. This complication of process calls for a simple solution, and that solution is real estate apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you think that as a startup you can provide that solution, then this article is for you. If you want to create your own real estate app like Zillow but don’t know how then this article is going to give you all the details you need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From idea validation to all the steps that it takes to build such an app (no pun intended!) and then some unique integrations, we are going to discuss it all.  So without any delay, let’s look at the steps you need to follow first. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a Real Estate App like Zillow &#8211; Brick by Brick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like a difficult thing to do, but building a real estate app is extremely easy, especially if you follow these steps…</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s create a real estate app now!</span></p>
<h2 id="Validate_your_real_estate_app_idea"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1st Brick: Idea Validation: Why You Should Create Your Own Real Estate App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about the validity of the idea before talking about realtor app builder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first glance, the idea of such an app seems a little ridiculous. Because buying and selling houses is something that has been done without any apps or software for decades. So why suddenly use an app now?</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11399" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11399 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map.png" alt="average rent prices" width="900" height="639" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map.png 900w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map-300x213.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map-768x545.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11399" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Rentcafe</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look into the image above, the high rates of rents are proof of why people are looking to but their own homes rather than giving rents. With real estate apps like Zillow and Trulia in Casablanca and California, the real estate industry is one step closer to digitization, helping to make the complicated process of home buying easier. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Better for mobility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it going to be easier for users to use their smartphones for property browsing? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes. They are using their phones for every other task anyways. If you <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/">make the right app</a>, users can look for property on the go with these apps. There’s no need to visit every prospective house and location they see fit. They can check out the details of the house or the apartment from the app and visit if it matches their requirements. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Location centric</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a geolocation feature on every smartphone and that m2akes it easy to make location-centric searches. So it’s not surprising when the users can make location-centric searches and find the places nearby without any hassle. Zillow real estate app makes it easy. Take a note here.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Instant notification</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an instant age and people like things instantly. They don’t want to wait for weeks to get details on a property, they want those details instantly, or at least want to know instantly when the details are becoming available. And that’s how real estate apps are becoming crucial for the users on their path to find the perfect home. </span></p>

<p class="title">Building an App is NOT ENOUGH. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/app-store-optimization-rank-your-app-higher/">Know how to optimize it right for the app stores.</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s see how real estate mobile app development is helping the industry professionals-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Providing Better Customer Support</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real estate business is a complicated one, but if you create your own real estate app, you can ease the pain. The clients need proper customer support to actually get through this. And an app is going to be the perfect tool for that. The features such as constant and direct connection with the clients are going to make it easy to build a healthy relationship with the clients. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. The Direct Marketing Facility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate apps are the best instrument for directly marketing your business to the clients. There is no interruption of a third party or spam. Not only it will bring in more clients and therefore more business and revenues, but it will also keep the clients engaged with your business.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">F. Stand Out Among The Competition </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an app, you will get a better understanding of your clients as well as stay updated with the popular market trends. Not to mention, with a specialized app for buying and selling property, you will be able to stand out in the market and get more clients easily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have validated the idea of real estate app development, we need to talk about the two distinct types of app you can build. </span></p>
<h2 id="Know_the_app_types"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2nd Brick: Know The App, Know The Types</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you hire any freelancer or real estate app development company, you need to understand the app types. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to mobile app development for real estate, there can be two types of apps depending on how they function. The first one is an agency based app, and the second one is a third party app. How these apps function? Let’s see-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. The Agency App</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency app, just like its name, belongs to the specific real estate agencies. Working as the digital face of the business, the agency app lists all the houses under their listing, has all their agents listed for easy access of the users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the agency app, the agency can keep track of their business improvements, how many clients are engaging with their agency, and what their demands are. It is basically an improved tool for business management and improvement. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. The Third-Party Model</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third party or the aggregator model works as the mediator between the buyers and the agents. The workings of the third party model is a little different than the agency app.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can sign up either as buyers/sellers or freelancer agents. The freelancing agents can upload their own listings and expand their network through the app.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user, on the other hand, can contact the agents nearby, browse through their listings, look for houses they are interested in. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sellers can sign up and contact the agents about the property they want to sell. The third-party app basically becomes a platform for the agents and the buyers/sellers to easily and instantly communicate. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have decided on the app model, the next step is going to be planning the right real estate mobile app features. </span></p>
<h2 id="Plan_out_the_app_features"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3rd Brick: Planning the Futuristic features</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like manners maketh man, the features maketh an app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why you have to be careful about picking the right features for your app. The right real estate mobile app features can help your app become more functional and useful for the users. You can also go for a whiteboarding session with <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/">a reliable mobile app development company based out in Casablanca</a> to get the feel of the market. So what kind of features does your real estate app need? Here is a list-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Login/Signup</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By signing up the users can create a personal account where they can save various information and preferences, search histories, etc. There are a few ways this feature can be implemented-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can sign up using their mail ID or phone number. It is also important that you implement the social media signup feature. With this feature, the users can sign up using just one tap. Make sure that the app is easily accessible from the login/signup phase.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. View/Edit Profile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the ability to create a profile, the users should have the ability to view and edit their profiles as well. The users can add and edit their details, search histories, preferences, etc. This feature will not only let them personalize their profiles but also make their app experience better. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Filter &amp; Search</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users are going to use various keywords to look for the right property. This means that your app is going to need a robust search and filter feature. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11441" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11441" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11441 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property.png" alt="create a relate estate app with property searching feature" width="1650" height="1276" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-300x232.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-768x594.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-1024x792.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11441" class="wp-caption-text">Real estate app designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search feature needs to be incredibly accurate so that the users don’t have to search too long for a location. And to make it more accurate, you need to add a filter option as well. With this option (also present in Zillow mobile app), the user can filter properties by location, prices, type, ratings, etc. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Mapview</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For property searches, the map feature becomes incredibly important. With this feature the user can easily navigate new locations, routes, look for specific landmarks near the properties, etc.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11442" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11442" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11442 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view.png" alt="create your own real estate app with map view" width="1650" height="1276" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-300x232.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-768x594.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-1024x792.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11442" class="wp-caption-text">Created by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another unique way of integrating the map feature is through heatmaps. With heatmaps, you can display proper distribution of data about things such as crime rates in the neighborhood, traffic flow in the locality, population density around the property, etc. To integrate the heatmap feature,  you’d need to consult Google maps documentation for information on heatmap utility for android apps, and for </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iPhone app development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you need to consult the displaying overlays on a map in the iOS developer library. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. Property Details</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is property details. Of course, the users need to know all the details about the property before expressing any kind of interest in it. In the real estate app Zillow or Trulia, you will see houses needs to have the below-mentioned details listed to attract the interest of the buyers-</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How old the house is?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the condition of the house?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the offering price is?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the house</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long the owners have lived there.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many times the property has changed hands in the past.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brief history of the property.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the property details section, no buyer will show any interest in the property, so make sure that the details section is clear and detailed. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">F. Reviews &amp; Ratings</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ratings and reviews are other important features that your app needs. With this feature, the users will be able to leave their reviews on the property after viewing, about the agents on the platform and help the other users to understand the quality of service they can get from the app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">G. Image Gallery</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pictures are worth a thousand words, and even though there is a long and detailed description of the property, the buyers want to look at pictures. With the image gallery feature, sellers and agents can upload detailed images of the property to attract even more clients. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">H. Social Sharing </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With most people on social media platforms today, it is necessary that your app includes a social sharing feature as well. Because through social sharing, the sellers and agents can share a property listing on the social media platforms and get more interested buyers. </span></p>
<h2 id="How_should_be-the_UI/UX"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4th Brick: Interior Decoration for the App: the UI/UX Design</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decorating the interior of a house is important, so is the UI/UX for real estate mobile app design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the UI UX of a real estate app that is going to keep the users engaged in your app. They would move on from the app if they don’t like the design and user experience. So how are you going to make sure that the design and experience of your app stay up to the mark? Here are eight tips to design an amazing UI/UX for your app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Use Clear Images And Videos</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of clear images and videos is going to form the visual aspect of the entire app. The users definitely want to see the images before they decide if they want to go and visit the property or not. To create your own real estate app, you need to use high definition images is going to improve UI aesthetics as well. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Don’t Use Just Maps, Use Heatmaps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The map feature is a must, but there’s another way to improve it and that is through heatmaps. With the distribution of colors, heatmaps display various data such as population, crime rates, etc. The implementation of this feature is not only going to elevate the user experience but it is also going to make your app look great. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11443 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-image-gallery.png" alt="real estate mobile app features " width="1650" height="1276" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-image-gallery.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-image-gallery-300x232.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-image-gallery-768x594.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-image-gallery-1024x792.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Easy To Understand Menus</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid using too complicated terms and words for menus. Buying and selling a property is a complicated task already, and adding complicated terms is going to add more pressure on the first time user. The use of easy-to-understand terms for menus will help the users feel more comfortable with your app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Easy Navigation Pattern</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The navigation flow of your app needs to be easy to understand, almost intuitive. The users shouldn’t have to scramble through your app to find what they are looking for. So make sure that the transition from one point to another on the real estate app is easy and smooth. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. 3d Walkthrough And Floor Plans</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An added bonus to the image feature, 3D walkthrough, and floor plans would help the buyers to get an actual understanding of the floor plan, how the house looks from the inside and whether it matches their requirements or not. It will help them to make a decision on if they want to check out the property in real life or not. </span></p>
<h2 id="What_should_be_the_tech_stack?"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5th Brick: The Tech Stack That Makes the Apps</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After deciding all the features and functionalities, you need to decide on the proper tech stack to implement all those interesting features on your app. Here are a few tech stacks used by apps such as Zillow mobile and Trulia to get you started in planning the tech stack for your tech stack to create real estate sites like Zillow.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audience for property apps are quite extensive, including all kinds of people. So it’s important to go with a multi-platform approach, in which care, you will need Java to develop real estate applications for android and Swift for the iOS version. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Database: you can use Postgress, PostGIS SQL to integrate the databases on the system. You can also use APIs such as SimplyRETS, iHomeFinder, etc. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For social network sharing, you will need the Facebook SDK. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can create an interactive and customizable map with the help of Mapkit. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push notification feature: Firebase SDK and Apple Push Notification. </span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Monetization_Strategy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6th Brick: How to Make Money With the Apps?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re going to spend a lot of money to create a real estate app. Get an <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown/">estimation of how much does it cost to build an app</a> now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tried and tested, this monetization model has been around for a long enough time. And surely with relevant advertisements, you can generate revenue easily. However, make sure that the ads displayed are relevant to real estate, such as bank loans, mortgages, home renovation, etc. Every time any user taps on the ads you will earn a small revenue. If you want to create your own real estate app, this is your way to earn more money.</span></p>

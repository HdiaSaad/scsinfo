										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this tech-savvy world, almost all of us are familiar with the terms like Big Data and AI. but do we know what they stand for?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, we have a vague idea. We know that Big Data stands for a huge amount of data sets that result from continuous corporate surveillance on us, and  AI stands for intelligent systems that can not only make decisions on their own but also have the power to take away jobs. But is this all there is to big data and AI?</span></p>
<p>Actually, no. there’s much more to big data and Artificial Intelligence than these concepts. The world of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence is vast, and it is not possible to completely understand that. However, that doesn’t mean we can not try.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s Start With A Little History</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will talk about the present and future landscape of AI and Big Data. But before that, we have to talk a little about their past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of data in industries like Agriculture has been around since the Mesopotamian age. It is undeniable that data has been used to improve various aspects of society throughout history. But those data, however, are not Big Data. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12183" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12183 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cray-Catalyst-big-data-supercomputer_llnl_credit_cray_small.jpg" alt="big data and ai" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cray-Catalyst-big-data-supercomputer_llnl_credit_cray_small.jpg 600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cray-Catalyst-big-data-supercomputer_llnl_credit_cray_small-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12183" class="wp-caption-text">Source: insights.dice.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term Big Data was </span><a href="https://datafloq.com/read/big-data-history/239"><span style="font-weight: 400;">used for the first time in 2005 by Roger Mougalas from O’Reilly Media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It purely denotes the huge amount of data collected by big companies daily. 2005 also happened to be the same year when Yahoo! developed Hadoop to index the world wide web. As an open-sourced system, Hadoop is now used by different business organizations around the world to analyze huge amounts of data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI, on the other hand, is something entirely different than big data technologies. Big Data deals mostly with human users and their data. AI looks toward an automated machine system that can make decisions based on the available data. AI can be called a direct descendent of the Big Data trend, even though the concept of AI has been around longer. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12184" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12184 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alex-knight-2EJCSULRwC8-unsplash.jpg" alt="AI robot" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alex-knight-2EJCSULRwC8-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alex-knight-2EJCSULRwC8-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alex-knight-2EJCSULRwC8-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alex-knight-2EJCSULRwC8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12184" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Photo by Alex Knight on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term Artificial Intelligence was </span><a href="https://www.livescience.com/49007-history-of-artificial-intelligence.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first used in 1956, at a conference at Dartmouth College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The concept of automated inanimate objects that can perform tasks on their own has been around for a long time, and with Modern AI, that concept has come to reality. Whether we are talking about AI-based robots or cars, artificial intelligence is working smoothly to automate every part of our lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they differ from each other, there is a fundamental connection between the two. And to understand their future, we have to understand their symbiotic relationship at first.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Data And AI: The Relationship</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the fundamental workings of the two technologies, Big Data and AI can not be far apart. The first one deals with better handling of data, generating insights. And the second one uses that data to automate systems and make decisions without any external help. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12186" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12186" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12186 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sketch1502807165218-768x576-1.png" alt="big data and ai" width="768" height="576" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sketch1502807165218-768x576-1.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sketch1502807165218-768x576-1-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12186" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.optimumtelligence.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between AI and Big data is that of give and take. AI uses the data sets to get better at the decision-making process, while Big Data uses smart AI systems for better data analysis. Let’s look at how they are connected in a detailed manner.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. How AI Uses Big data?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Big Data analysis, systems were merely trained on a basis of variables and made simple decisions based on that. However, with big data analysis, things have gotten a little more advanced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The huge datasets that have been named Big data, simply contain too many variables to be analyzed and used in programming systems. And that’s why the smart AI systems are merely fed the data. These systems analyze the data, learn the patterns, and eventually get better trained at dealing with similar kinds of data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine an AI system that is being trained to recognize the prices of houses. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first step, the smart system will be fed with real estate Big data about various houses and their prices, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system will eventually discover a pattern within the data, and the various factors which make the house prices fluctuate.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on, the AI system will become an expert in determining house prices, thanks to the Big Data collected by a real estate company.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The function of AI depends on big data technologies. However, Big data depends heavily upon AI as well.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. How Big Data Is Benefitted By AI?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI helps in understanding as well as helping us to understand Big Data by providing proper insight into the pattern. It deals with the fundamental question we all have when it comes to Big data and that is, what to do with all the data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI helps in discovering new ways of understanding and discovering patterns within the huge amount of data sets. Earlier big organizations and data engineers used queries and MySQL to derive insights into the data, which happened to be an extremely laborious task. But with AI/ML in hand, it is not as laborious as it used to be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added to that there’s the matter of data quality. The huge amount of data that companies collect can not be used without sorting them out. Not all the variables can be used by them to make data-driven decisions, and that’s where AI comes in. It sorts out the variables, recognizing the ones that’ll be useful and discards the others, making a completely usable dataset that can help the companies to make better business decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now the combination of Big Data and AI is being used by numerous industries in various ways. From treating patients to quality control in a manufacturing line, there are simply way too many uses that are enriching the Big Data and Artificial intelligenceI landscape at present.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Data And AI: The Present Landscape</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you call it invasion or advancement, we can not ignore the various applications of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence throughout different industries. industry professionals consider the automation of industry workings to be the ultimate sign of modernization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to understand the present and future landscape of Big Data and AI is to understand the present uses of the technologies and the results we are deriving from that. Big Data and Artificial Intelligence have disrupted many different industries until now, and here are the top five among them. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Big Data And AI In Healthcare</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Healthcare system is flooded with a huge amount of data on a daily basis. And the only problem is that there is no set infrastructure that can make sense of this data and make use of it. And that’s why the use of big data and artificial intelligence in healthcare has become a necessary approach to improve upon the current healthcare industry.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12187" style="width: 441px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12187 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BD-in-Healthcare.jpeg" alt="big data" width="441" height="321" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BD-in-Healthcare.jpeg 441w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BD-in-Healthcare-300x218.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12187" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.simplilearn.com/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, however, many healthcare organizations are using this data to better the kind of treatments provided to the patients. The data that is collected by healthcare organizations is not only being used in providing proper treatment to the patients but medical research as well as better diagnostic research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only artificial intelligence and big data in public health makes it easy for healthcare professionals to make better and data-driven decisions, it is also helping the patients to get more personalized healthcare services. Chatbots, medical apps, and wearables are only the foyer of the immense possibility AI has in the healthcare industry. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Big Data And AI: the Financial Magic</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are definitely many uses for big data in the banking and finance industry. But the most popular one is in the prevention of fraud and security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data is being used to analyze the spending habits of the customers and recognize the set patterns. Whenever there are any transactions conducted outside of the set pattern, it is flagged as a suspicious transaction and both the bank and client are notified about it. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12194" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12194" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12194 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nick-pampoukidis-t-UV1rZqPuY-unsplash-1024x685.jpg" alt="big data and AI" width="1024" height="685" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nick-pampoukidis-t-UV1rZqPuY-unsplash-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nick-pampoukidis-t-UV1rZqPuY-unsplash-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nick-pampoukidis-t-UV1rZqPuY-unsplash-768x514.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nick-pampoukidis-t-UV1rZqPuY-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12194" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Nick Pampoukidis on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early detection of fraudulent activities is definitely making the client&#8217;s bank experiences more secure than ever. Add to that the constant maintenance and upgradation of cyber-security systems in place, and banking experience has never been so secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one other major use of big data and AI in the finance sector we have to talk about and that is financial forecasting. Bigger organizations, as well as individual customers today, are using the big data and Artificial Intelligence-based forecasting software, that analyzes the financial data and provides advice on how to invest money and get the best results. This use of AI and big data is not only about improving the customer experience, but also about ensuring their steady financial growth. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Big Data And AI In Insurance Industry</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main challenge the insurance industry has faced till now is inadequate utilization of the available data. The data collected by insurance organizations all around the world can be used to provide personalized services, pricing and targeted services that can improve the experience of the client. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, insurance companies today are using big data analysis to analyze and detect patterns within the collected data so that they can provide better and more personalized services to the clients. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12189" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12189" style="width: 848px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12189 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/For-website-BLOG-1.png" alt="Big data and AI" width="848" height="500" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/For-website-BLOG-1.png 848w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/For-website-BLOG-1-300x177.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/For-website-BLOG-1-768x453.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12189" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.testingxperts.com/blog/5-Areas-in-the-Insurance-Industry-where-Big-Data-can-make-a-huge-Impact</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such a case, the analytics system is used to sort through the data and recognize the specific insurance-related requirements for the clients of different age segments. And then the AI system works is trained using the data, helping the client with more personalized service that fulfills their requirements.  According to </span><a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/07/big-data-insurance.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the client data is collected from two sources- the online behavior of the clients, and sensor data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the healthcare industry, there are still a lot of persisting problems in the insurance industry when it comes to the use of electronic data and artificial intelligence. However, according to </span><a href="https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/next-gen-technologies/heres-how-ai-is-helping-indian-insurance-industry-improve-customer-experience/74766974"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, insurance companies are using ai-based systems to improve upon their customer experience. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. eCommerce Industry: The Most Famous User For Big Data And AI</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, we are all familiar with how the ecommerce industry is using AI and big data to provide us with better customer support and ecommerce experience. The AI/ML based suggestion system can range from wondrous to downright creepy, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that it is not being useful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main impact of big data and AI in ecommerce will be that of customer satisfaction. Previously we had to search for a product every time we went to an online store. Now, using the machine learning methods, the store simply remembers our preferences and shows us the product upfront, reducing the need to search for it on the store. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12190" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12190" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12190 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/box.jpg" alt="Box" width="512" height="341" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/box.jpg 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/box-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12190" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Photo by Brandable Box on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data analysis also provided the online store owners with real-time data analysis that helps them to make better decisions that help the store to grow. The data on customer demographics, shopping patterns, and spending habits can be used to create a better shopping experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seamless shopping experience is only about to get better in the future as the big data analysis and AI technology improves. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Future Landscape Of Big Data And AI: Trends And Challenges</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have spoken about big data and artificial intelligence, what they are and how they are being used in the recent scenario, it is time to talk about future trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the experts, both big data analytics and AI technology are going to see exponential growth in the coming years. But what are some of the specific trends and challenges we will get to see? </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Data Volume Will Continue To Rise, Making Cloud Computing A Popular Option!</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.seagate.com/in/en/our-story/data-age-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">”Data Age 2025&#8243; report by IDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the global datasphere is going to reach 175 zettabyte by 2025. The main contributor to this large amount of data growth will be the increasing number of internet users all around the globe and the rise in the number of iot devices. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12191 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cloud-services-isometric-composition-with-big-cloud-computing-infrastructure-elements-connected-with-dashed-lines-vector-illustration_1284-30495.jpg" alt="Big data and AI" width="626" height="532" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cloud-services-isometric-composition-with-big-cloud-computing-infrastructure-elements-connected-with-dashed-lines-vector-illustration_1284-30495.jpg 626w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cloud-services-isometric-composition-with-big-cloud-computing-infrastructure-elements-connected-with-dashed-lines-vector-illustration_1284-30495-300x255.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, this large number of data will be impossible to store and manage, therefore making cloud storage and computation migration a necessity. Cloud computing services such as aws, microsoft azure, google cloud platforms have already made cloud storage and computing easier for the companies. And now they are only going to get more popular. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Machine Learning Is Going To Become More Important Than Ever.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you thought machine learning is being overused now, wait till you see its increased popularity in the future. With the increase in the collected data, it will encourage more companies to use machine learning to provide the users with machine learning based customer experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The improvements of the algorithm, on the other hand, will increase the abilities of the machine learning services. This will eventually lead to a higher level of personalization in any and all kinds of services, something we have yet to experience. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the challenge remains, and that is if the increasing abilities of the ai/ml systems will take away the jobs of millions of people around the world. The matter of AI automation is already under fire, and in the future, there might be more resistance against the subject of workforce automation. However, all we can do right now is wait and see how it all turns out. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Data Scientists And Chief Data Officers Are Going To Be In Demand!</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though these career prospects are comparatively new, they are also in demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 survey conducted by KPMG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed how among the 3,600 CIOs and technology executives from 108 countries around the world, a staggering 67% of professionals struggled with skills related to data analytics, AI and Machine learning and security. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12193 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/headway-5QgIuuBxKwM-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="Big data and AI" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/headway-5QgIuuBxKwM-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/headway-5QgIuuBxKwM-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/headway-5QgIuuBxKwM-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/headway-5QgIuuBxKwM-unsplash.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shortage of professional data analysts and CDOs are being felt by most of the big corporations wanting to utilize big data and AI in their business ventures. And as a result, these professional posts are going to become even more popular in the near future. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Privacy &amp; Security Will Still Remain A Major Concern</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the data sets containing our data are being used for good till now, there are still some concerns about how it is going to be in the future. And you can expect these concerns to become bigger in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamentals of big data depend on the collection of data from various sources, whether it is from our online behavior, or from our iot based refrigerator. This process of data collection is what puts the practice of big data in serious question. The question of privacy in big data and AI has always been rampant, but in the future, it is going to become even more prominent concern for a large number of people.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The matter of big data and AI is definitely fascinating and frightening. Fascinating because it is opening up newer avenues in various industries that we have never even imagined yet.  But on the other hand, it is frightening cause we have no idea what these technologies are capable of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there&#8217;s no doubt that the popularity of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence is only going to increase in the future. And there are bigger chances that despite the challenges, it is going to introduce more breakthroughs in various industries and changing the way we interact with the world.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is no more an unknown term to us. Regardless of any industry, the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ (AI) is creating quite a lot of buzz in the market.

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start!</span></p>
<h2 id="An_insight_into_the_AI_market_in_the_eCommerce_industry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Look Before You Leap &#8211; A Detailed Insight to AI market in eCommerce </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start the segment with an important stat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, by 2025, AI revenue is expected to reach almost </span><b><i>$36.8 billion in the global market</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the survey report by PwC, the power of AI is almost limitless. And </span><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/artificial-intelligence-predictions-2019.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2030, this futuristic technology can contribute up to over $15.7 trillion to the global economy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM has recently released a study report. And it says, in the next 3 years, the consumer product and retail industry will witness a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">40% to 80% increase in the AI-enabled smart automation adoption</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Insider has made another prediction. According to it, </span><a href="https://www.kdrrecruitment.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2020, 85% of the customer interactions will be done without a human</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, investing in AI is undoubtedly a profitable idea now. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11693" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11693" style="width: 574px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11693 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-business.png" alt="Ai in eCommerce business" width="574" height="514" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-business.png 574w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-business-300x269.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11693" class="wp-caption-text">Source: pwc.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, integrating AI in eCommerce businesses ensures 24/7 availability of services to its customers. Thus, businesses can keep their customers engaged even outside the usual business hours. Without a doubt, it helps in generating more leads. Also, it results in increased revenue growth. </span></p>
<h2 id="A_short_backstory"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. How It All Started &#8211; A Short Back Story</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, online businesses were paying the utmost importance in delivering top-notch user experience only. Trawling through pages after pages to find the right product is not at all feasible for the customers. The big players in this industry understood that. And accordingly, they put all their effort to come up with the easiest and slickest online store design. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11694 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/History-of-Artificial-Intelligence.jpg" alt="AI in eCommerce" width="802" height="420" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/History-of-Artificial-Intelligence.jpg 802w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/History-of-Artificial-Intelligence-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/History-of-Artificial-Intelligence-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the trend of a keyword-friendly search bar came into the picture. It helped the users to easily find relevant products based on the search queries. It was another revolutionary change in eCommerce websites and stores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely, UI/UX is still one of the most crucial success-determining factors for eCommerce businesses. However, time flies. And with that, the market demands change as well. Soon, the businesses understood that they need something more. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking customer behavior in an online store</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying the shopping pattern and accordingly, recommending other products to customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing customers with more personalized shopping experience, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the introduction of AI in the market, achieving all these goals have become more convenient. No wonder why AI has become a big hit in the eCommerce industry these days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, already a handful of online businesses are leveraging the power of this advanced technology. And many others are already working on adopting it with its full potential.</span></p>
<h2 id="How_is_AI_transforming_the_eCommerce_industry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. How is AI Transforming the eCommerce Businesses? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, you’ve seen how it all started with AI in eCommerce. Also, you have got to know how it is expected to grow beyond your expectations in the coming years. But how? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here it is!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Voice Assistants </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI has blessed industry-specific businesses with voice assistants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we buy any product online, we compare similar product features and prices, right? But typing in Google and searching for it is too old-fashioned now. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11695 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/andres-urena-tsBropDpnwE-unsplash-min.jpg" alt="andres urena Brop Drop Unsplash" width="3000" height="2000" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/andres-urena-tsBropDpnwE-unsplash-min.jpg 3000w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/andres-urena-tsBropDpnwE-unsplash-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/andres-urena-tsBropDpnwE-unsplash-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/andres-urena-tsBropDpnwE-unsplash-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are living in the era of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Assistant</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siri</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Be it any product or service &#8211; whatever you are looking for, is just one command away today. Yes, AI-enabled voice assistants have made it possible. Now, don’t you think implementing such voice assistants in your online store would be great?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would not only help you to deliver a stellar shopping experience to your customers. But it will help you to stay ahead of your competitors as well in today’s vying business market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a glimpse into a few stats on voice assistants.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the report by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quoracreative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stats, </span><a href="https://quoracreative.com/article/voice-search-statistics-trends"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2020, 50% of all internet-based searches will be done using voice assistants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To buy a product or service via voice commerce, almost 62% of users use voice assistants.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., 30% of internet users use AI-enabled voice assistants to purchase a product or to find information on a product. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, this is the time you too should go for implementing voice assistants in your eCommerce store. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Chatbots </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s busy lifestyle, no one likes to wait forever! Suppose a visitor has some queries in mind before making a product purchase. Now, your eCommerce site visitors would expect lightning-fast responses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is quite impossible to handle by a human. Unless you get such dedicated employees who will be always there to respond to the queries without even taking a break. Now, what if a query comes at an unusual business hour. Or, what if thousands of queries come at the same time! Sounds complicated, right? This is where you need chatbots. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11696 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chatbots-min-e1583931373423.jpg" alt="Ai in ecommerce" width="2000" height="1825" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chatbots-min-e1583931373423.jpg 2000w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chatbots-min-e1583931373423-300x274.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chatbots-min-e1583931373423-768x701.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chatbots-min-e1583931373423-1024x934.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots can handle multiple queries at the same time. More interestingly, such automated programs can simulate ‘humanly’ conversations. These chatbots can be the perfect shopping assistants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking from a retailer’s perspective, integrating it is a great idea. It not only reduces effort but cost as well. At the same time, it enhances the customer experience. This is why most online businesses are reaching companies that work with AI and bring revolution in </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce web development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know some globally popular websites are already enjoying the benefits of implementing AI chatbots? Well, big names like Amazon, eBay, Starbucks, etc. are included in this list. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Personalized Recommendations </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product recommendation is the reflection of visitors’ activities on an eCommerce website. Also, it is done based on the previous purchases a visitor has done. But the question is how?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, AI helps to track what a visitor is looking for or what purchase is being done. Based on the visitor’s preferences, it shows smart product suggestions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you are buying a mobile phone from an eCommerce site. Now, using the AI-powered recommendations, the site will show you suitable phone covers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s consider another example. Suppose you are buying jeans. The smart AI recommendations can show you tops, or bags, or shoes that go well with the jeans. Maybe initially you were buying only jeans. But now, you end up buying the complete look or maybe one or two things from the suggestion list. Thus, personalized recommendations help eCommerce businesses to drive more sales. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Automated Product Description and Product Tagging</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right product description is crucial for online stores. We can’t touch or feel the products physically while making online purchases. So, we go through the product images and descriptions in detail. And then we decide whether to buy it or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, manually writing the descriptions for thousands of products is not at all a feasible idea. But with AI, it becomes a cakewalk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copying the right product description from the manufacturer&#8217;s website is fine. But AI does more than that. By scouring the Internet, AI finds the most relevant product information. And then combining all these, it prepares the perfect product description that your shoppers look for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of some of the benefits of automated product descriptions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The descriptions include the most demanding details</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generates plenty of product descriptions within a short time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shows dynamic pricing. It helps in maximizing the sales and results in higher revenue growth</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzes the effectiveness of the product description. Also, AI can change it as per the requirements</span></li>
</ul>
<p>How easily consumers can find your products on the internet while searching for a specific query is also crucial for driving your eCommerce business. So, your product discoverability should be top-notch. And AI-enabled catalog management tools can help you in achieving so.</p>
<p>With such AI-enabled tools, businesses now can easily come up with well-defined, accurate, and consistent product tags. This ensures your product catalog is of sheer quality. Also, it enhances the product findability on the internet.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. Warehouse Automation </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, AI is transforming warehouse management as well. AI-enabled robots do not need lunch breaks or smoking breaks! They can work 24/7 without taking breaks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it is not like they do not talk. Yes, they do. But they communicate with the AI-enabled software that manages the warehouse. Whenever a purchase is made, their work starts. AI-powered robots can take the ordered products out of the stock, pack it, and make the order ready to be shipped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might think that I’m talking about something from a science fiction movie. But I’m not. These are now possible by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. It is true that we can’t see it in small medium-sized businesses yet. But it is possible. And maybe in the near future, it will become common. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being an eCommerce retailer, what can you enjoy from it?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower labor cost</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved accuracy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast work</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diminished loss from damaged goods, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">F. Intelligent Email Marketing </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are thinking that email marketing is dead, you are wrong! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true that nowadays, we hardly open an email if it is from an eCommerce site. But it does not mean we are not interested to receive an email about the products. We simply don’t like receiving an email about a product which we are not at all interested in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you need to transform your email marketing strategy. And AI can help you with that. How?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emails can be automatically sent at the right time when recipients may actually read it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than sounding automated, it ensures a more ‘human touch’</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the customer feedback, making real-time changes in the strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the responses, smart and intelligent customer analysis </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending emails only concerning a customer’s real interests, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using AI in your eCommerce business, you can know your customers better. And it helps you in chalking out better plans for email campaigning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the things I’ve mentioned above, here is a list of other perks of leveraging the power of AI in eCommerce.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intelligent searches</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retargeting your potential customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filtering out all the fake reviews</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales forecasting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual search</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhanced cybersecurity</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What_is_the_future_of_AI_in_the_eCommerce_sector"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. What is the Future of AI in the eCommerce Sector? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI in eCommerce is not a very new thing. From the last couple of years, we’ve seen eCommerce businesses taking interest in it. But, many online stores are still unaware of the benefits they can avail of it.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11697" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11697" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11697 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-banking-and-payment.png" alt="Future of Ai in eCommerce payment and banking" width="960" height="873" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-banking-and-payment.png 960w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-banking-and-payment-300x273.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-banking-and-payment-768x698.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11697" class="wp-caption-text">Source: businessinsider.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in the coming years, it is expected that more and more businesses will embrace this futuristic technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, I’ve mentioned automated warehouse management in the above section. This is still not that popular the way it should be. We can expect it to become a mainstream trend in the coming years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When artificial intelligence meets IoT &#8211; it can become a deadly combo! Today, eCommerce sites are rapidly moving towards big data. So, who knows, maybe soon your smart devices would assist the online stores to understand what you might buy from them! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is powerful beyond your imagination. And it comes with huge possibilities and opportunities. We all look forward to what it brings in the coming years. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping Up</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI in eCommerce has set a new standard in this industry. Delivering an amazing shopping experience is the main objective of any eCommerce business. And AI has taken it to a whole new level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A quick and more personalized customer service, retaining customers, devising effective marketing strategy &#8211; AI single-handedly looks after everything. </span></p>

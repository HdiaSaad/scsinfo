										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run, Forrest, Run!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I’m not going to talk about Forrest Gump here! But I’m just taking the reference of “running”. And I’m going to share with you all how we, the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">UIPL family</a> participated in a recently organized marathon and enjoyed the event throughout the day. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Quick Sneak Peek to “Green Marathon”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBI, our nation-wide renowned Public Sector Bank organized a “Green Marathon” across 15 different cities in India. And it had its Kolkata edition on 23rd February 2020. Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM, another renowned brand of the nation took the initiative of this one of the biggest marathon events in the “City of Joy”. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12163 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sbi-green-marathon.png" alt="sbi green marathon" width="601" height="537" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sbi-green-marathon.png 601w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sbi-green-marathon-300x268.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p><b>Venue Details of the Event: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eco Park Gate 1, AA II, Deshbandhu Nagar, Newtown, Kolkata</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have followed our blog archive, you are probably already aware that at UIPL, we do not always work only. We believe in the “work smart, party hard” motto. So, we arrange games, employee outings, competitions with fun-filled activities, and take part in different events around the city whenever possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, when we got to know about this big marathon event, our management instantly decided to be a part of it. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Greater Cause Behind The Event</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The greener future” &#8211; we all dream about it, right? A cleaner environment, a greener city, breathing fresh year &#8211; all these seem like a fiction in today’s busy world. Pollution and global warming are always in the limelight. These issues are always in the headlines!</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12164 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-1024x682.jpg" alt="forest trees perspective bright" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, in such chaos and amidst so much of negativity, when an event is organized to promote a “greener future”, how can we not be a part of it? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12165 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Green Tree" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the main objective of organizing the “Green Marathon” is showing our commitment towards the greener and fresher environment and sustainable development. And this was indeed a “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">zero-waste</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” event. And being the responsible citizens, we took part in it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if I were to flaunt how physical activities like running can help us, I would have come up with a long list of benefits. Not only better physical health but our finer mental health, enriched soul, personal development &#8211; everything comes from physical activities like running. And not to forget, there is fun too. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Event Day</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, in Kolkata, shivering cold is not an issue in February and that too around the third week of the month. But this year, it was a bit of an exception. And the “Global Warming” caused by us only was one of the main reasons behind it. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12166 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-1024x767.jpeg" alt="UIPL team" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, beating the “not-so-freezing” cold, we all reached the venue within the reporting time i.e. 5:45 AM. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different Running Categories</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the entire marathon event had different categories based on the total distance to be covered. The three different categories were:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12167 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-1024x767.jpeg" alt="uipl team 1" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21 km</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 km</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 km</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for different categories the reporting time and the flag off time were different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our UIPL family participated in the 5 km marathon. So, our reporting time and flag off time were 5:45 AM and 6:45 AM respectively. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Glimpse of the Ambiance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be amazed to know that around 7,500 participants came that day to participate along with us. Even if it was Sunday, people from different backgrounds and different ages came together to pledge for a greener future.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12168 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-1024x649.jpg" alt="uipl team 2" width="1024" height="649" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-1024x649.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-768x487.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gold medalist of the Asian Games, an IPS officer, the first Bengali mountaineer too came to participate. So, from the very beginning, we all felt so energized to see so many enthusiastic and energetic faces around us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the event organizing partners just nailed it. The arrangements were huge. Every participant got t-shirts. And you know what all the t-shirts were organic. The main objective was to promote a greener and cleaner city. And the bibs we all got there consisted of seeds for tree plantation. Sounds cool right? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12169 " src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/green-marathon.png" alt="green marathon" width="853" height="580" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/green-marathon.png 691w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/green-marathon-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Source: https://ibgnews.com</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, on every checkpoint, there were water stations. It is not like everyone can start and finish maintaining the same pace. So, keeping that in mind, there were enough water stations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we got mouth-watering food packets as well after the marathon was over.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Our UIPL Team Performed There </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, even though we clicked a lot of photos together and enjoyed ourselves before starting the marathon and post-marathon while running, not every one of us was together! </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12170 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-1024x767.jpeg" alt="green marathon 1" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our developers put on his headphones to listen to some kickass music while running. Another developer was fully concentrating on the run! I’m sure rest performed well too because all of them got their medals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be amazed to know that each of our superwomen at the office, who participated that day, completed the entire 5 km run within the allotted time too. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12172 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-1024x767.jpeg" alt="uipl team 3" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, yes, after that kind of achievement, we all want to flaunt our medals! </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Feeling of Achievement</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it is not like every one of us regularly exercise (which is not a very good thing though!). To some extent, our busy lifestyle is kind of responsible for that. Still, when we got an opportunity like this, we could not afford to miss it.</p>
<p></span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12173 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-1024x767.jpeg" alt="uipl team 4" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
See, how the happy faces look! Being able to be a part of a greater and better cause, we all are very happy indeed. And the feeling of an accomplished achievement is clearly visible in our faces! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, we all will plant the seed we got. And if you have reached this far while reading, I would like to request you too that please plant more trees. Also, encourage people to do so and make your city greener, cleaner, and a better place to live. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping Up</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, this was our story to make this world a better place even if it is a tiny one. But to reach a goal, you need to start taking your steps right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UIPL, we always encourage this type of activity. Also, such gatherings help us to make our network stronger. Meeting new people comes with new opportunities. Thinking in this way helps us to grow together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t want to be the “Jack”, who is a “dull boy”! So, both work and play are important to us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that was all for our “Green Marathon” day out. I will keep you posted about our next events too. Till then you can follow us for any technology and development-related news, updates, releases, and guides.</span></p>

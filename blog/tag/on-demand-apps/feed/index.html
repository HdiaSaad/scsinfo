										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you get when you take the Uber app model and dog walking, and smash them together?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple, <strong>a dog walking app</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dog walking app model has been in vogue for the dog owners for quite some time. It is not easy to have a pet dog. No matter how much you love your furry little baby, you still have social responsibilities, and a job to take care of (I mean, the job is kind of a must, considering the lavish lifestyle you want your dog to have!).</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/KhMslxMPXdQbu" width="480" height="390" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dog-walk-KhMslxMPXdQbu">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These responsibilities can easily interfere with the various responsibilities you have towards your dog. You can’t just adopt a dog, you need to train him, groom him, take him to the vet, and regular walks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you can’t outsource help with all these responsibilities through different dog walking platforms. But you can when it comes to dog walking. With on-demand dog walking app development we mentioned, it is super easy to get dog walkers on short notice for pooch’s regular exercise. Especially for those millennials who are busy to take their dog for a walk. Interested to create your own dog walking app like Uber? Read on to know more.</span></p>
<h2>How to Develop an On-demand Dog Walking App?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a step by step description of how to create an on-demand dog walking app like Rover and Wag!</span></p>

<h2 id="How_does_a_dog_walking_app_work"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Dog Walking App: How Does it Work? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An amazing use of the Uber for X application model, the dog walking app is making it easy for busy dog parents to get walkers easily whenever they want. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11074" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11074" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11074 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net.png" alt="on demand dog walking app by AI robot" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net.png 800w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net-300x225.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11074" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://dribbble.com/shots/5687141-Drone-dude-walking-with-dog</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to any on-demand delivery app, with these dog walking platforms, the users register themselves, with adequate details about them and their dog. They can add detailed notes about their dogs, which might include information on vets and medications, leash, collars, and harness, etc. After registering, the user can book a walk or ask for a dog walker and they will be matched with a walker near them who can take care of the dog when the pet parents can’t. Uber for dog walking solution has made this easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now dog walking app platforms are extremely popular, among both the dog owners and dog walkers. Because it happens to be a great source of earning money, as well as hanging out with dogs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry though, making such a dog walking app is actually very easy. All you have to do is to follow the below steps or contact a professional dog walking app development service.</span></p>
<h2 id="Market_analysis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Will it be Profitable to Develop Another Dog Walking App?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, we all know how much dogs are loved and cherished by their owners, but what does that have to do with the rising popularity of the dog walking apps? Is developing a prosperous pet care platform really profitable?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, in order to understand the rising popularity of the on demand dog walking app, we have to look at two different kinds of statistics. The first one is, of course, the number of households in the US that own dogs and the second are the average numbers of hours a person has to work every week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to APPA’s national pet owners survey 2019-2020, around</span><a href="https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 63.4 million households in the USA owns a dog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And according to this </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/323441/average-hours-worked-per-week-by-full-time-us-workers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statistic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least 40% of workers have to work 40+ hours every week. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11056" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11056" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11056 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/work-hours-in-a-week.png" alt="work hours in a week.png" width="725" height="592" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/work-hours-in-a-week.png 725w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/work-hours-in-a-week-300x245.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11056" class="wp-caption-text">Source Statista</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we consider these two stats, you’ll see that most of the dog owners have to work more than 8 hours every day. And on top of those 8 hours, they also have tons of social and personal things to do. And even though they do love their dogs, these things are still important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to these apps, people, especially those who have too much to do every day, can rest assured that their pets will be taken care of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few reasons why dog-walking apps are becoming so famous.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time-saving &amp; Efficient</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Way Of Earning</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase In Business For Dog Sitters And Daycares</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Figuring_out_the_basic_features"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Basic Features That You Need for an MVP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, you have to sort out and implement the basic and necessary feature for your app. This would answer how to develop an on-demand dog walking app in the first place.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11057" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development.jpg" alt="on demand dog walking app development like Uber" width="638" height="641" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development.jpg 621w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can already tell, a dog walking app is a very feature-driven app. These features need to be designed to make it easy for the owners to use the app. And that’s why we have listed below some basic features that your dog walking app needs.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Sign Up/set Up A Profile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any Uber-like app, your app should have the feature of signing up and setting up a personal account. This is a must-have feature because it will be easier for the owners to manage the walks and sitters they book, schedule the bookings and cancel in case they don’t need a sitter anymore. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Inserting Information About The Dog</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature would enable the users to add special notes on their dogs to their app profile. These notes can be on anything, from their behavior quirks to any medicines they might need, or any allergies they might have. These notes are going to further help the designated walker to take care of the pup while on a walk. </span></p>
<h3>c. Booking A Walk</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you need this feature for your app to be called a dog walking uber app. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users should be able to book a walk easily and efficiently. Keep in mind the time factor for implementing an easy walk booking feature on your app. It is an important and the main feature to build your on-demand dog walking app solution.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. GPS Tracking</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this feature, the users would be able to track their dog on their walk and would also be able to check the route the walker has taken. This is another convenient feature for those anxious dog parents who are not exactly assured about having a stranger walk their dog.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Walk Log</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the walk log feature, the dog walkers can keep a log of events that happened on the walk. These records can include pee-poop logs, any other dogs they met on the walk, duration of walking, water breaks, whether the dog played any games or not. With this, the user would have an easier time keeping a track, which might come in handy. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">f. In-app Payments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the in-app payment feature, the users can easily pay off the walkers through the app. It means that the users don’t have to hand over cash or go through complicated back transfers. They can just pay using their debit or credit card through the app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">g. Ratings And Reviews</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can leave reviews and ratings based on their experience. These ratings would help the dog walkers to get even more assigned walks. Additionally, the users can express additional tips concerns about a certain walker if they have a bad experience. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">h. Scheduled Walks</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature lets the users make a one-time booking and schedule regular walks for a longer time span. This is a convenient feature for those who for some reason or other can not go take their pet dogs for regular walks.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Push Notifications</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, push notifications are important because how else would the user stay alerted about everything? From the walker picking up the dog to all the actions that happen on the walk, cancellation, successful bookings, payment confirmation, all the information needs to reach the user in a convenient way. </span></p>
<h2 id="Advanced_features_to_make_your_app_stand_out"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Advanced And Unique Features for On-demand Dog Walking App Development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the above features are the very basic features of an on demand dog walking app, your app needs some advanced features to truly stand out and become one of the top dog walking apps. So let’s see what kind of advanced features you need for your app to stand out for the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/">mobile app development</a> for dog walking.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Filtering Feature</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature is going to help both the owners and dog walkers to filter and sort through the walkers and walk requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a much needed yet much-ignored feature. The dog owners can filter out walkers depending on various factors and choose one from the pool of walkers they prefer. The walkers too can choose and filter through assigned dogs based on the area and dog breeds. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Curated Professional Advice</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be a valuable feature for those first-time dog parents. With daily tips on grooming, training, and diets, the daily tips and notes from professional vets, trainers and groomers can be very useful to the dog parents. Extra points if these daily tips can be modified to match specific breeds of dogs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Doggy Playdate</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like human beings, dogs too need daily socializing. While dog parks can be a great place for this, often there are bigger dogs there who can intimidate all the other dogs and ruin the fun.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11060 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dog-playdate-on-app.jpg" alt="play date in on demand dog walking app " width="640" height="439" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dog-playdate-on-app.jpg 640w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dog-playdate-on-app-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why being able to set up a dog playdate can be an amazing way for the pet parents to set up playdates between two or more dogs so that they can get the much-needed socialization they need. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Sales &amp; Events Notifications </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can be notified whenever there are any specific events or sales going on nearby. This will not only be a fun way to spend time with their dogs but also help the owners to meet other dog owners. Events such as dog show, special training campaign, service dog training, along with a sale on toys and dog food can be included in this feature. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Community Feature</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group or community feature can help the dog parents and walkers on the platform to come together in one group and exchange information about caring for dogs and important notifications. This will be a good way for everyone to communicate with each other.</span></p>
<h2 id="UX_design_needs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing An Attractive UI/UX to Create Your Dog Walking App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it is a dog walking app, you need to pay enough attention to the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/">UI/UX design</a>. The ease and flow of the user interface will determine whether the user is going to come back to your app next time they need a dog walker or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that the User interface is easy to understand and navigate through. Booking a dog walker is not going to be as easy as ordering a cap or food. Even though the app model is a lot similar, the interface design needs to be different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there are going to be a lot of details to put in regarding the owner and the dog as well, make the forms precise and easy to understand. No need for fancy use of language or extra images. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that at the end of the day it is an app for busy dog parents to get a walker for their dogs in an efficient way. They are not going to be impressed with extra <strong>effects</strong> and <strong>animation</strong> if it does not help them to schedule a walk quickly. </span></p>
<h2 id="Extra_security_Necessities"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Safety Measures To Take &#8211; Make Your App Secure</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dog service app still poses a lot of security risks to both the dog parents and the walkers. And to make it more secure for them, you should integrate some extra security features when you go for on-demand dog walking app development.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Background Checks For The Walkers </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been more than one </span><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/dog-stolen-wag-walker" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where the pet care provider from popular dog walking services fell short of the quality these companies promised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering all the weird incidents that created headlines like </span><a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2345986/cautionary-tale-about-dog-walking-apps" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dog-walking apps have a shaky reputation among the users. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Safe Way To Hand Over The Keys </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, the dog walkers booked through the app are arriving at your apartment when you are not home. In such a case, they need access to your apartment. Apps like Wag! Provide the owners with a lockbox, with a security code facility. The users keep the keys of their apartment inside this box and lock it with a code. The security code is only shared with the walker books, through the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though this system seems full-proof, it isn’t. There have been many </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-thinks-robber-accessed-home-dog-walking-app/story?id=65405550" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">instances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where the dog walkers, with access to the security code, have robbed the house. And that’s why you need a safer way of handing over the keys. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Insurance For Pets And The House</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pet-owner-blames-death-of-her-dog-on-rover-app/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tragic incident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the pet parent left their blind dog with a sitter booked through one of the popular dog walking uber app, but the dog fell off of a two-story building and passed away. Not to mention the various robbery incidents that have happened to many dog owners. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Live Cam And Photo Posting Feature During The Walk</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The live cam and photo sharing feature can actually guarantee the real-time safety and security of the beloved pet. Having the dog walker go live through the app when they are picking the pup up for the walk and dropping them back home, can satisfy users to know that their dog is safe and sound. </span></p>
<h2 id="How_to_earn_from_your_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. How To Earn From Your App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the main aim of creating an app is to monetize it. And we take care of this in our dog walking app solution. When it comes to monetizing an app for dog care on demand, you need to know about the various monetization models. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Make Money With Marketplace Model</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You create a platform, where all the other pet care providers can register and get bookings independently. All they have to do is pay a small charge to the platform for every booking and sitting completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is basically a peer to peer-based payment model which helps the users to pay for the pet care service to the walker through the app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Create Your Pet Care Agency App &#8211; The Agency Model</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is another model for this app, which is the agency model. With this model of monetization, you hire pet sitters and walkers, provide extensive training and eventually employ them as pet care providers. Unlike the marketplace model, the walkers here are not independent workers, rather they would work under your platform. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/top-app-monetization-ideas/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10809 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-monetization-ideas.jpg" alt="on demand dog walking app development" width="635" height="146" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-monetization-ideas.jpg 635w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-monetization-ideas-300x69.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. One Time Sign Up Fee</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is for both service providers and pet parents. Having them pay a one-time signup fee would not only help you to raise revenue, but it will also help them take advantage of the various features of your platform.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Annual Fees For Users</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recurring annual fee to get access to premium features is a common monetization model for the most on-demand app. And that’s why utilizing it for your app can be a great way of raising revenue</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Product Advertisement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can easily monetize your app by showing relevant advertisements to the users. Getting into paid partnerships with various dog food or dog toy companies. However, make sure before you get into a partnership that the company is reliable and doesn’t endorse any kind of harmful product to the pet parents. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">f. Selling Merchandise</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course,  selling merchandise on your dog platform is an amazing way of raising revenue.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the newest trend for on-demand service apps? Of course the Uber for X model.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This specific model, based on the business model of popular cab service app Uber, is now the ruling trend among the </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">service app maker</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The popularity of this makes it kind of obvious that even the grocery delivery apps are going to follow this trend.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you may be just a normal Joe who wants to make an app or an experienced grocery app developer who wants a piece of this Uber for X ‘cake’ for their business. In any case, if you are wondering how to build a grocery app, then you are in the right place.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we dive deep into the grocery store app development and what it requires, take a detailed look into the Uber For X concept and what it means.  </span></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber For X Concept in Grocery: What Does It Mean?</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The on-demand app sector is being driven by this Uber For X concept, including grocery store apps. But what does this Uber For X even mean?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s simple really. The X in ‘Uber For X’ stands for any service the user requires. So, an Uber for X app is like Uber for cabs.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you book a cab on uber, you get your ride almost instantly, or within a set time. Just like that, and Uber for X app provides the customer the service they require, almost instantly, or within a set time limit.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups are using the Uber For X model to provide their users for various services such as </span><a href="https://www.doctorondemand.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctor on demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>Foodnow<span style="font-weight: 400;">, etc. Grocery delivery apps are also under this business model.</span></p>

<h2 id="step1">1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Types Of Grocery Apps &#8211; What Business Model You Should Go For</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are thinking about how to create a grocery app, you must know that there are four different kinds of apps. And these are-</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketplaces</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketplace apps have their own menus and delivery drivers to take orders and deliver the grocery to the doorstep. In case you don’t have a prior grocery related business but want to pursue a grocery app, then this is the most suitable type of app for you.</span> The Bigbasket online grocery shopping app is one such example which is popular in India.</p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregators</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregators list all the nearby stores and their menus. This kind of app lets the user order form these listed stores. They use affiliate drivers to deliver the products but the fulfillment of the product depends on the store.</span> one such example is Instacart, popular in US and Flipkart grocery app which is running successfully in India.</p>

</div>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grocery Chains</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big grocery store apps like Wal-Mart and The Kroger Mobile App have their own apps for their customers. With these apps, the consumers can easily order their groceries and have it delivered to their home. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single Stores</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Created by the single stores, these apps are specially for the regular customers of the store. The app building and management, taking orders and delivering them, everything is handled by the single store. This way they can get more business their way.  </span></p>



<h2 id="step2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Three Ends Of Grocery Apps- Buyers, Sellers And Driver’s</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t just create one grocery app and be done with it. When it comes to on-demand grocery app development, there are three sides to the app. </span></p>

<h2 id="step3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Consider The Important Factors</span> and Design Your App</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the on demand grocery app development process starts, you need to consider some important factors. This will make it easier for you to plan your app and market it to the user. Along with that, doing this will make sure that your app stays more unique than your competitors. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Addressing The Pain Points Of The Customer</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like with the development of any other app, you need to understand and address the pain points of your user. Before you ask how to develop your grocery app, you need to ask why everyone is using grocery apps? </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the app offering them that the store can not?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you understand why apps are more preferred by the user, you need to make it better. Plan and figure out how you can make their shopping experience even better? By doing this you are not only going to give your users a better experience but set yourself ahead of your competition. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Analyzing The Strength And Weaknesses Of The Competitors</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No app is unique today. Which is why you need to consider your competitors before you even begin the planning phase. </span></p>

</figure>
</div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Install and use the competitor&#8217;s apps for a while and see what they are doing right, and what they are doing wrong. What are the best features of their apps? And what is the worst? Why people like their app, or hate it? Once you have the answer to all these questions, you’ll know you are ready to start planning your app. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Attractive UI/UX Design And Layout</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Attractive UI/UX design goes a long way when it comes to on demand grocery app development.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1650" height="860" class="wp-image-9361" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-screen-1-1.jpg" alt="how to build a grocery app with best UI UX" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-screen-1-1.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-screen-1-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-screen-1-1-768x400.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-screen-1-1-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></figure>
</div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have finally started on your grocery store app development, you have to make sure that your app has a good UI/UX design and layout. The more attractive it is, the more enjoyable it’ll be for the user to use it. And the more they enjoy using the app, the more people would start using your app.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because you are selling vegetables doesn’t mean you don’t need a good layout for your app. A beautiful layout is absolutely necessary to keep the users stuck to your app. Talk with an experienced <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/" target="_blank">UI UX design agency</a> to manifest your grocery app idea.</span></p>

<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-build-habit-forming-technology-the-future-of-enterprise-app-development/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" width="1962" height="456" class="wp-image-9355" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-1-1.png" alt="make your grocery app habit forming - secrets" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-1-1.png 1962w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-1-1-300x70.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-1-1-768x178.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-1-1-1024x238.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1962px) 100vw, 1962px" /></a></figure>
</div>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Personalized Experience To The Users</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One size fits all” sounds only good as an expression. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to grocery store app development, personalizing your app to the user is kind of a big deal. This is going to give them a feeling that the app owner, which is you, really cares about their needs and wants as shoppers. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how can you personalize their experience? Simple, you can use machine learning to make sure that the app learns about their shopping preferences the more they use the app. You can offer them special deals based on the products they frequently buy.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suggest them products they frequently buy. You can also give them a favorite feature where they can add their liked products for quick access. Personalizing the app according to the user’s need is only going to make them more loyal users. </span></p>



<h2 id="step4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Necessary Grocery App Features To Implement</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are hiring grocery app developers should know that every grocery store app needs some necessary plus customized features. These features are supposed to make shopping easier for users. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are these features?</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating A Shopping List</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many times has it been that you’ve gone shopping, but forgot what to buy cause you didn&#8217;t write a shopping list?</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1650" height="860" class="wp-image-9367" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-list-of-items-1.jpg" alt="how to build a grocery app with shopping list" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-list-of-items-1.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-list-of-items-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-list-of-items-1-768x400.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-list-of-items-1-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></figure>
</div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too many times. Same goes with online shopping. There is a good enough chance that you might forget to add one or two items on the cart. Which is why you need a shopping list feature. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this, the app user can create a shopping list of all the things they need and search accordingly. Bonus points to your app if they can just directly share their shopping list with the vendor through the app placing their order simply. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick And Easy Search</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to search for an item in a store, isn’t it?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why people moved to online grocery apps so swiftly. It’s an awful waste of time wandering through the aisles looking for your favorite kinds of cookies. On the grocery apps, however, it’s awfully easy. All you gotta do is to search for it.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1650" height="860" class="wp-image-9368" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-search-items-1.jpg" alt="how to build a grocery app search option" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-search-items-1.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-search-items-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-search-items-1-768x400.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-search-items-1-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></figure>
</div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if it’s not easy to search and find products on your app, then there is really no point in using it. Customers need to be able to find their products easily on your app. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that all the products are categorized well on your app. With a proper category, you can make it easy for the user to find their products. It’s not going to work if they find eggs under the vegetable category. So use the categorization feature well. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add To Cart</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an obvious feature in all and any shopping app. The Cart.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is symbolic of shopping for stuff. So it is no wonder that &#8216;add to cart&#8217; is a feature that you need. Allow the users to add things in their cart. They might buy it right then, or maybe later. But once they add it to the cart, they won’t forget to buy it. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular And Favorite Items</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add the suggestion section where you can show the user popular and their favorite items based on their recent purchases. With this section, you can help the users to access the products easily.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1650" height="860" class="wp-image-9369" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-add-to-cart-1.jpg" alt="how to build a grocery app add to cart" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-add-to-cart-1.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-add-to-cart-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-add-to-cart-1-768x400.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-add-to-cart-1-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></figure>
</div>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special Deals, Offers, And Rewards</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether a shopper or online grocery app developers, you should know that giving the users special deals and offers on their frequently purchased product is a feature that’ll have a positive effect on your app. With such deals, you can make sure that the users return to your app for buying their groceries again and again. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push Notifications</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To let the users know about the deals and offers going on in your app you need the feature of push notifications. Not only for offers and deals though, but the users can also set up reminders to buy certain items or to notify them when a certain item is on sale. Push notifications can go a long way to make your app become the new favorite to the users.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Order Tracking And Status</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the order has been placed, let the user track its progress and status. With this feature, they would be able to track the progress of their orders and see how long it will take for it to get to them.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure Multiple Payment Options</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When going through grocery shopping app development it is important that you have multiple options for payments in your app. With the ability to pay directly from their phones, users are going to have a better shopping experience. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also add different payment methods like Paypal, PayU, Quickpay, etc. by adding these payment methods. Adding these methods is going to make it more convenient for the users to shop from your app.  </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scheduled Delivery Times</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t stay at home all the time just cause there is a delivery pending from a grocery store app. Which is why it is better to integrate the scheduled delivery times feature into your app. With this, the user can schedule the delivery time for their groceries. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can have the groceries delivered to their doorstep at a convenient time for them. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ratings And Reviews</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this feature, consumers can leave ratings and reviews on different products and shops from where they ordered the product. They can also give reviews to personal shopper or deliveryman. This will help them pick only the best for them. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutritional Value Of What You Are Offering</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the health conscious this is a neat feature. They can check out the nutritional value of the food items they are ordering. You can also add a quick suggestion feature based on the specific diet they must be following. This feature will bring more health conscious crowd to your app.  </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan A Meal Order The Ingredients</span></h3>

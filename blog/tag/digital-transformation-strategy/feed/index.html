										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">What is digital transformation?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Search online and you’ll be bombarded with thousands of digital transformation definitions. Some will talk about how it is the integrations of the latest tech solutions within the business process. Some, on the other hand, talk about how it is almost a spiritual business change. In the end, you’ll close that tab with one question in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“What is digital transformation for MY business?”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s look at the definition.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. What Is Digital Transformation: Popularity, Definition &amp; The Benefits</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Digital transformation, also known as DX or digitalization happens to be the most popular search query right now. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/870924/worldwide-digital-transformation-market-size/">Statista</a>, the direct digital transformation technology investment amount is going to reach a total of $6.8 trillion between 2020-2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All entrepreneurs are gearing up to turn their businesses into the next digital sensation. But before joining that crowd, you have to understand what it means.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Duality Of Definition</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is no single definition for digital transformation, despite its popularity. And it is mainly because everyone has a different definition of the term &#8216;digital&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some will tell you that it is all about the integration of technical solutions. For others, it is the automation of the business process. And some groups believe it is a 360-degree change that impacts the business from the inside out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But which one of them is true?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13150" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-1024x986.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="986" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-1024x986.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-300x289.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-768x740.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-1536x1479.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-2048x1972.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, all of them are. Digital business transformation strategy is not a single faceted matter. In fact, it is a dynamic journey that includes both kinds of definitions. So let&#8217;s look at the different meanings of this process.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">a. The Narrow Perspective</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The narrow perspective of digital transformation is focused on only innovative technology solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The narrow definitions talk only about technology. Be it AI, AR/VR, blockchain, or IoT, it is always about how these solutions will help your business. However, it is not always inclusive of specific business needs.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">b. The Broader Perspective</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The broader perspective of digital transformation definition focuses on the process and people involved. It is a complete transformation of the older business structure. This transformation impacts the employees and alters the way they can provide valuable experience to the consumers.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">c. What Is Digital Transformation: The Combined Perspective</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">You cannot define digital transformation focusing on only one of the perspectives. They are both parts of a complete transformation effort. And that’s why the combined definition looks something like this-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><i>“Digital transformation is the integration of necessary technical solutions within the business process. It alters the existing work model &amp; organization culture, streamlining the communication &amp; collaboration efforts of the employees. Overall, it helps to reach business goals and deliver better value to the consumer at the same time.”</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><i>The combined definition covers all the necessary parts of </i><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/digital-transformation-strategy/"><i>digital business transformation strategy</i></a> <i>one can find online-</i></p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">It includes the matter of business/enterprise technology solutions. <i>(Not FOMO based technical integrations)</i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Includes the matter of the existing work model &amp; cultural change. <i>(To be digital, the employees must think digital)</i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">And lastly, it includes the employees and consumers as well.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that is the perfect definition of DX. Now let’s talk about how our experts at <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">Unified Infotech</a> make a digital transformation process work.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">

</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. The Process Of Transformation</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the definition above, we know that there are three aspects of the digital transformation maturity model. These are-</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The technology</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The business culture</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The people</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">The process of transformation will also depend on these three aspects. So what does the process look like?-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13146" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-768x767.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-1536x1534.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-2048x2045.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 1: Beginning With A Purpose</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beginning with a clear purpose is the first step of complete transformation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/8/digital-transformation-how-lead">Jay Ferro of Quikrete explained</a>, “Digital transformation should begin with a problem statement, a clear opportunity, or an aspirational goal”. This way you can create a necessity within the employees. This sense of urgency drives up the speed of the transformation process.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beginning with a purpose will help you to clearly explain to the employees what the aim is. Knowing the endgame, the people involved in the process will be more excited about the whole journey. And this enthusiasm will make them more willing to fit into the new digital style.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Starting the process only with business technology solutions in mind will be a waste of resources. So ensure that the process starts with a clear purpose, a definitive “WHY?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 2: Determining The Scale</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not every organization is on the same level when it comes to its digital operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe the competitor is light years ahead of you when it comes to the modern business landscape. On the other hand, maybe they are just beginning with their attempts at transforming the business. Either way, the second step will be to determine its transformational stage you&#8217;re on.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On this second step, many professional services leverage the <a href="https://ceo801mstro0h2uinte.blob.core.windows.net/legacyassets/system/manifestos/pdfs/000/000/996/original/178.03.DigitalTransformation.pdf">5 stage model of digital transformation by Tony Saldanha</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13147" style="width: 864px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13147 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png" alt="" width="864" height="479" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png 864w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-300x166.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-768x426.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13147" class="wp-caption-text">Source: inthebooks.800ceoread.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">The model displays 5 stages of the digital work-process in a company. When you determine which stage your organization belongs to from the beginning, it will result in better planning. For example, an organization that belongs to the foundational stage will need more than a plan. It will need a robust training curriculum and in-depth insight into consumer&#8217;s favorite digital trends.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Based on the stage, you will have to craft effective plans for business operations management. So, in this second step, analyze your business process and define the scale of effort that is required.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 3: Choosing The Right Tech Enablers</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the step that focuses on the technical aspect of the process. Choosing the right tech enablers depends on two things. The first being your purpose. And the second being the stage of transformation your company belongs to.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When thinking about what is digital transformation, many only think of the tech-approach. The tech-first approach is the reason for failure for many organizations. And that’s why whatever enterprise technology solutions you focus on during this stage should depend on these elements-</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The main purpose of the entire transformation effort.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The stage of transformation you are aiming for.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The technical trends that are popular within your industry and among the competitors.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">These touchpoints will ensure that the innovative technology solutions provide real value to your business process.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 4: Focusing On The Cultural Change</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just having some business technology solutions is not going to be enough. You need to update the company culture to match the latest work process.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Streamlining the business process requires a level of cultural change within the company. This change includes an understanding of employee values, opinions, and expertise on the integrated solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A lack of alignment can cause the entire process to fail in the technical integration stage. Employees who don&#8217;t understand the reason for this change will be reluctant to make any efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Carey Oven, a partner with Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory at Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP <a href="https://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2019/07/18/the-role-of-culture-in-digital-transformation/">puts it</a> perfectly. According to her- the leaders must win the hearts of employees with tech initiatives. Otherwise, the effort will stall before it has any positive impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The people involved must be onboard with the digital transformation technology investments. Or, your efforts will fail before they can take a concrete shape.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 5: Optimizing The Complete Consumer Experience</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Transformation efforts should also aim for a better customer experience. There’s no point in increasing functional efficiency if it fails to elevate the quality of the CX.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The positive impact of digital transformation on customer experience helps to scale the business. For this, you must break down the institutional data silos first. With the use of combined insight, you&#8217;ll get a better idea of what people are experiencing. Based on the consumer input, you will have a better chance of enhancing the CX through proper digital solutions.<i> </i></p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. Are There Any Benefits Of Digital Transformation?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">All the trials &amp; tribulations do lead to some amazing benefits of digital transformation. Here&#8217;s a comprehensive list of all those perks for you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Increasing The Accuracy Levels Of Insight Generation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Data collection and analysis is one of the fastest ways to grow your business. With digitization, it becomes easier for multiple departments to gather, sort, and store data. Enhanced data operation makes analytics &amp; insight generation more accurate. With digitization, you can also break down the institutional data silos within the departments.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Breaking Down Of Departmental Barriers</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The quality of teamwork improves with the use of the right kind of digital transformation maturity framework. It breaks down the data silos and helps different teams to partner up and work towards a collective goal. Additionally, it also speeds up the employee&#8217;s upskilling efforts and enhances communication between different teams.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. Boosting The Sustainable Growth Of Your Business</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enhanced data analysis makes consumer insight creation easier. With digital transformation solutions for marketing &amp; sales departments, you can use these insights and elevate the consumer experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Constantly keeping up with the changes in consumer attitude makes it easy to <i>alter</i> the digital strategy. <i>The combination of </i><i>digital transformation &amp; customer experience </i><i>improvement efforts</i> <i>is one of the major drivers of business growth</i>. And that&#8217;s why proper integration of solutions can increase the quality of the CX.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">You know what digital transformation is! But have you considered being Agile during the transformation efforts?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/digital-transformation-in-manufacturing-industry/">The right kind of digital transformation strategy</a> helps global industries survive, sure. But sadly, very few look beyond the digital aspect of it. It is not just a matter of integrating technology solutions in the business. There&#8217;s more to it than what meets the eye.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And for this more aspect, you need the assistance of the Agile method.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">Focusing On A Singular Digital Aspect Might Be A Mistake</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">What is digital transformation?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The basic idea is all about the adoption of digital technology to remodel the old business process. There are many reasons why business owners think it is important for the business. Some of these are- enhancing the consumer experience, reaching business goals, and beating rivals easily.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important to embrace and make use of new technologies to improve the business process. But it is still not the make or break aspect of such efforts. Going digital means creating a business process that delivers value to the clients. It should also help the business to keep on growing exponentially. However, focusing on only the technological aspect of digital transformation trends is not the way to do it. And this is where agile methodology comes in.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Did you know?</strong> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/09/30/companies-that-failed-at-digital-transformation-and-what-we-can-learn-from-them/?sh=711ca9cd603c">In 2014, Ford attempted their hand at digital transformation</a> with Ford Smart Mobility, a new business segment. However, the attempt soon failed because the transformation was treated merely as a separate new venture. But they should have reinvented their entire business process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">Agile Methodology &amp; Digital Transformation Consulting: A Perfect Match?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The traditional digital transformation strategy is not enough to keep up with the evolving digital panorama. With the legacy transformation, you&#8217;ll be stuck in a static one department at a time process. And when you finish, it will be time to update the solutions altogether, again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13088 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match.jpg" alt="" width="825" height="630" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match-300x229.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match-768x586.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To leverage all the benefits of new technology, you need a flexible and all-encompassing plan. And with a flexible plan, you&#8217;d be able to keep up with the following-</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Market competitors</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Changing demands of target demographics</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Altering business needs</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keeping up closely with these three elements will ensure that all your business decisions have the right impact. And to keep up with such multiple aspects, you need the agile approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">four principles of agile</a> have already proven to be helpful in business process transformation. Whether it is utilizing new digital transformation trends or ensuring the flexibility of digital solutions, agile helps businesses in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">How We Turn Digital Transformation Agile?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Agile helps us to soften the rigidity of legacy transformation models. It also ensures the longevity of the solutions in supporting any business venture of our clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But how do the principles of agile help with forming the digital transformation roadmap? Here&#8217;s how we apply the four principles of agile and enhance the transformation experience for our clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Principle 1: Transformation Based On Necessity, Not On FOMO</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first agile principle demands that we pay more attention to the people &amp; interactions rather than tools &amp; processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This principle puts importance on the team members involved in the process. Rather than focusing on tools and methods, we rely more on individual expertise to form the digital transformation strategy for our clients</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Surprisingly, even now, many digital transformation endeavors are taken up due to Fear Of Missing Out. Young entrepreneurs are continuously pestered with buzzwords such as IoT, AR/VR, Cloud computing, etc. To stay ahead of the curve, business owners often integrate these solutions without thinking twice. However, such spur-of-the-moment decisions can cause further problems in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The combination of digital transformation and agile ensures that the process beings value to our clients. Our initial discovery &amp; research focuses on what kind of results the people involved in the process are looking for. Rather than get distracted by buzzwords, we concentrate on empowering our clients with a sensible plan.</p>

<p class="title"><strong>Expert speaks:</strong> Digital transformation is not a simple integration of digital solutions, but changing your business to meet the new world business expectations &amp; goals. So before undertaking such a process, make sure you have some serious goals set and ready to be fulfilled.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Principle 2: Enabling Hands-On Transformation That Helps To Achieve Results</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Earlier, the focus of any development process was on creating thorough documents. But with agile, this focus shifted more towards continuous delivery of working solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Agile focuses on faster development and making changes based on client reviews. With this, the developers can create market-ready digital solutions in a lesser amount of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Similarly, the use of the agile principle helps our digital transformation strategy to achieve goals faster. Rather than holding meetings after meetings, we begin with a basic understanding of the business requirements and the expectations of the end-users. Then as we progress, we make the changes based on hands-on reviews.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our goal is to improve business methods with transformation efforts as efficiently as possible. And that is why we don&#8217;t base our process on assumptions. We aim for a more educated, review-based system, making changes according to client opinion after each development sprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Principle 3: Collaboration Methods For Better Tech Integrations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Successful transformation is not just about technical integrations. It is also about creating an organic link between our expert teams and clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To sustain the entire process and ensure the right results, we aim for an open and harmonious relationship with our clients. This helps us to understand their needs in-depth and search for growth possibilities. And for this, we use the latest communication tools, staying in touch with our clients constantly.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Principle 4: Responding To Changes With A Fluid Transformation Plan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes flexibility is needed to make a set of plans more effective. And that&#8217;s why we use the fourth principle of agile, which is- “responding to change over following a plan”. Here are some positive impacts of the application of this principle.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">1. Making Changes Becomes Faster &amp; Easier</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Digital transformation is not a monolithic occurrence. It is a continuous process that uses technical solutions to achieve business goals. This is why we need to pay close attention to the evolving tech scenario and make changes to the plan effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13091 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan.jpg" alt="digital transformation consulting strategy" width="825" height="630" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan-300x229.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan-768x586.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The combination of digital transformation and agile helps us to focus on new changes within the plan rather than follow the old and strict rules and documentations.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">2. Scaling With The Business Growth</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Businesses tend to grow and change requirements more often than you think. Such new variations usually happen based on trends, altered customer behavior, and business growth. However, to accommodate such changes, a modified digital transformation strategy is necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, the existing digital solutions need to be flexible enough to adapt to the times. In such a scenario, the agile approach helps us to create solutions that scale with the business as it grows.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">3. Pivoting Made Easy</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lastly, beginning with a set plan is good, but it also needs to be flexible. Unforeseeable changes happen all the time during the R&amp;D process, and a flexible plan can help with that. The fourth agile principle helps us to create a flexible plan that accommodates any sudden changes at any time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that&#8217;s how the four agile principles help us to digitally modify our client&#8217;s business. Now, before finishing off, let&#8217;s look at some major reasons why we choose this approach.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Delivering Value Continuously</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Traditional transformation efforts yield results over a longer period. However, those results can be ineffective sometimes. But our agile approach delivers continuous value that always measures up to the expectations.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The collaboration improves the existing knowledge on digital transformation trends for everyone. It lets them gather knowledge and implement it within the process. This way, the transformation efforts can keep up with the changing market trends effortlessly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Eliminating The Risk Factors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For all its benefits, such transformation efforts are not without any risks. Multiple factors put the success of business conversion stages in danger. However, the use of agile makes it possible to remove the risk factors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our collaborative process and short sprints make it impossible for any mistakes to slip by.

<p>So what does all these reasons for popularity mean for you? Well, as it turns out,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Live streaming is getting ridiculously popular day by day, and that means all the live streaming apps are making more money. </strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The live video streaming app segment is one of the most attractive markets today, and you should also work on capitalizing this golden opportunity. </p>



<h2 id="step2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Types Of Live Streaming Apps</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you try to figure out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to make live streaming app, you need to know their types. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10474 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/types-of-live-streaming-app.jpg" alt="how ti make a live streaming app" width="1650" height="2653" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/types-of-live-streaming-app.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/types-of-live-streaming-app-187x300.jpg 187w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/types-of-live-streaming-app-768x1235.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/types-of-live-streaming-app-637x1024.jpg 637w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to live streaming apps, there are three types:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live Video Broadcasting Apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live Audio Streaming Apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video On Demand Apps (VoD)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Let’s find out about them in details.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Live Video Broadcasting Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubt that when we hear of live streaming apps, we think of live video broadcasting apps. This is probably the most popular type of live streaming app in the market right now. With these apps, the users can watch videos in real time, right as they are being recorded. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Live Audio Streaming Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not just for videos, live streaming apps are also available for audios as well. While apps like Spotify are bringing the audio-on-demand feature to the users, radio apps like pandora are taking the users back to the nostalgic days of radios. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/music-streaming-app-development-features-cost/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">build a music streaming app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’ll enable the users to choose the audio they want to listen to whenever they want. In fact, with audio streaming apps, the users can also listen to live podcast. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Video On Demand Apps (VoD)<br /></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now we come to the last type, video-on-demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably know them as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime video, etc. these services and their apps are the most popular video on demand apps in the world. So when thinking about “How do you start a streaming service?” you have to also think about building an app for that streaming service. With a video-on-demand app, users can watch TV series and movies whenever and wherever they want. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start planning your streaming app development, you have to choose what kind of streaming app you want to make. The features and tech stack would be a lot different based on the type of app you choose to make. </span></p>



<h2 id="step3">3. Building The Perfect App For Live Streaming: Finalize the Features</h2>



<p>Building the perfect live streaming app- sounds pretty daunting, but trust us when we say, it is pretty easy. Whether you are thinking about making a native app or open-source live streaming software, there is a basic list of features. So let’s look at the basic features you need for your native app. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10475 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/live-streaming-app-features.jpg" alt="how to build a live streaming app with best features" width="1650" height="2430" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/live-streaming-app-features.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/live-streaming-app-features-204x300.jpg 204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/live-streaming-app-features-768x1131.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/live-streaming-app-features-695x1024.jpg 695w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></p>





<h3>A. Sign Up/Sign In</h3>





<p>With this, the user can sign up on your platform as a verified user. Being able to create an account and profile will help them immensely in following vloggers, creating the content of their own and having a safe place to store them if necessary.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/q25XjDC4afkDjoImM-mp57yyZC772grMdtUHrZQbppmUizcL3DQ3oTizw2tl6gW7I4Ek0FCTf5SoSCoS-q4ZYduiSdvhZI1wo5C5mG216RSJlyIjtaQQ7Ac_6mcjeU5v5ASOI40" alt="periscope" />
<figcaption>Source: Periscope</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>



<p>Make sure to integrate more than one way of signing up though. This will make onboarding easier for the users. </p>



<h3>B. Profile and settings page</h3>



<p>One the users have signed up on your live stream platform, they should be able to see the profile and settings page. </p>



<p>With this, they can customize their profile with personalized information such as their name, where they are from, their age and interests. </p>





<p>You can also add several ways to register – for example, with the help of Facebook, which will make onboarding faster and more convenient.</p>



<h3>C. Notification To The Followers</h3>



<p>Notifications are a handy little thing. </p>



<p>With the notifications feature, the user can send a prior notification to all their followers before or while they are going live. This way the followers will be able to catch the live stream before it ends.</p>



<h3>D. Social Media Sharing</h3>



<p>Of course, just like every other aspect of life, social media has a big role here as well. </p>



<p>When you think about it, you will see that live streaming is also another kind of social media interaction. This is why having a social media sharing feature in your app is going to help your users reach more viewers. They can share the video after they are done live streaming or post about their streaming session on their account. The social sharing feature can work in various ways, you just have to implement it in your app. </p>



<h3>E. Podcast Along With Broadcast</h3>



<p>Podcasts will be a fine addition to your already fine app. </p>



<p>Think about it this way, your app is already going to be used by people to broadcast themselves. So why not let them broadcast their voice as well? A lot of times the users lack the visual content to go with the message they want to send to their users, and not to mention, having a live stream of an interview can get boring (unless it’s an interview of your favorite celebrity!)</p>



<p>And that is where the podcast feature can be an amazing feature. This will give the users a chance to only broadcast their voice, adding a little variety to the platform. </p>



<h3>F. In-App Storage Facility</h3>



<p>Live streaming videos is a fleeting form of social interaction.</p>



<p>And if you want something more permanent on your live streaming app, then you should add the feature of In-App Storage facility. With this, the users can download the live streams they want to see again on their app. The vloggers themselves can also download and add their most popular live streams on their profile. </p>



<p>Even though it goes against the policy of live streaming which is “living-in-the-moment” this is a handy tool for those why are adding some sort of tutorial on their live streaming. It is incredibly handy for iOS or Android live streaming tutorials,work-out tutorials, or cooking tutorials.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">G. Seamless Streaming With Auto Quality Option</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The auto quality option in famous streaming services is a pretty popular one. With this, the viewers can stream videos seamlessly. The Auto option on streaming apps optimizes the quality of the video according to the speed of internet and quality of device. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10427 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adaptive-bitrate-for-live-streaming.jpg" alt="adaptive bitrate system for a live video streaming app" width="1650" height="1389" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adaptive-bitrate-for-live-streaming.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adaptive-bitrate-for-live-streaming-300x253.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adaptive-bitrate-for-live-streaming-768x647.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adaptive-bitrate-for-live-streaming-1024x862.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology behind this option is called Adaptive Bit-rate system. With this, the bit-rate of the already compressed video file is changed so that the user can experience a seamless streaming experience. So when you are planning the features for your live streaming app, make sure to include the auto quality feature into it as well. </span></p>



<h3>H. Interactive Elements</h3>



<p>Just looking at a camera and talking is not exactly a fun way of doing a live stream. </p>



<p>Which is why your live streaming app needs interactive elements in it. Give the users a chance to react to the live stream while it is happening, along with commenting features. This way users will be able to engage with the person going live, making the streaming experience even more fun and engaging. </p>



<h2 id="step4">4. Designing the UI/UX for Live Streaming App &#8211; How We Can Make You Stand Out!</h2>



<p>The UI of an app is what makes or breaks it. Users judge an app first based on its user interface design. Which is why if you really want your app to become a fast favorite among the users, you have to start with good interface design. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="706" height="416" class="wp-image-9909" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/High-fiedelity-wireframes.png" alt="building a live streaming app with best UI UX strategy" />
<figcaption>High fidelity wireframing</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>But how are you going to design a great UI/UX for your live streaming app? Don’t worry, cause we got the answer. </p>



<h3>The 6 Design Principles We Follow</h3>



<p>The principles of design determine whether your design is going to be a good one or not. And that is why you should be following these six principles of design in your app. </p>



<h4>Structure</h4>



<p>Structure means the organization of the elements on screen in a coherent and useful way. Keep the design structure of your live stream app clean, consistent and meaningful. In this case, you can use the Information Architecture to give the right structure to your app. </p>



<h4>Simplicity</h4>



<p>It’s a live streaming app, which means people are going to get a little confused with how things work for the first few times around anyways. So make sure that the design is simple and it makes the common task of streaming live easy.</p>



<h4>Visibility</h4>



<p>The visibility principle determines what elements go on your screen. Don’t overwhelm users with unnecessary elements on your screen. Make all the necessary elements on your screen visible, and leave out the rest.</p>



<h4>Feedback</h4>



<p>Create such a design for your users so that when they are using your live streaming app, they are informed of all the actions, interpretations, changes and errors in simple language that is clear and concise. </p>



<h4>Flexibility</h4>



<p>The UI design of your live streaming app needs to be flexible. This way you can reduce the cost of mistakes made during the design phase. Give your users the ability to work with a varied range of input and sequences with a tolerant and flexible UI. </p>



<h4>Reuse</h4>



<p>With the reuse principle, you will reduce the user’s need to rethink and remember when using your live streaming app. Maintain consistency with a sense of purpose, by reusing internal and external components of the design. </p>



<h3>Identify The Elements</h3>



<p>No, we are not talking about the natural elements. We are talking about the design elements. </p>



<p>Whenever you are designing UI for an app you have to keep in mind that the identification process of your app’s function is important. This way you will be able to plan out all the design elements you need. </p>



<p>And that’s why you should start with mind mapping techniques. It is basically sitting down with the developer team you have chosen to hire and discuss and plan out all the live steaming app features you want.</p>



<h3>Sketch It And Design It</h3>



<p>Once you have gone through the identification process, it’s time to start sketching and designing process. We recommend going with the process of low fidelity process and high fidelity wireframing to give your users the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/" target="_blank">perfect UI/UX design</a> when you create a video streaming app.</p>



<h2 id="step5">5. The Technology Behind The App</h2>



<p>To build a video streaming app, you need to use a robust tech stack. And when it comes to your live stream app, you should want nothing but a robust architecture supporting your application.</p>



<p>With that being said, what kind of tech stack do you need for your app? Where can you get the live streaming app source code or the right live streaming SDK? Well, we have provided you with a table with all the important combination of software and development language you need to build your app. So take a look, and make some notes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/taO8nDzwPl6i57akPu9U8GR9_7Q6lABUnJ_RCZgnjOiIS6XfOmjRbi4kom1ILFSKMmj1mUOC9RwHh0eNC4jqjia0EId3Y47WZHSQHqYZjgOa5uZW0vz5u4DiPIVXarA7Hvfamdo" alt="how to build a live streaming app with the right tech stack" /></figure>



<p>The importance of a great tech stack is undeniable in the development of an app. So make sure that your app too has a good tech stack supporting it, giving the users the best experience ever. </p>



<h2>Bonus Tech Stack You Should Consider</h2>



<p>While creating your live streaming app, you need to make sure that it stands out in a market saturated with various live streaming apps. </p>



<p>But how are you going to do that? How do you make sure that your app stands out as a unique, one of a kind live streaming app in a market where there are so many competitors? Well, here we are going to tell you just how.</p>



<p>With the integration of some bonus tech features, you can definitely make sure that your app becomes different and unique. With the use of <strong>AI (Artificial Intelligence) and AWS Lambda serverless architecture,</strong> you can create video streaming app that is truly one of a kind. </p>



<h2 id="step6">6. Use AI To Create A Flagship Live Streaming App</h2>



<p>There are plenty of live streaming apps in the market, but how to build a flagship live streaming app? Simple, with the use of AI.</p>
<p>AI is taking over the app market, and it’s no surprise that even your live streaming app can use AI integration.</p>



<p>Since AI encompasses a vast range of complex learning process, the capabilities of this technology are vast. Which is why you should integrate artificial technology to handle the issues that have recently risen with live streaming videos.</p>



<ul>
<li>Object Detection As A Form Of Censorship</li>
</ul>



<p>Artificial Intelligence can us object detection as a method of censorship. With this, your live streaming platform can react faster in the case of a particularly violent live stream happening on your platform. In case of such a situation, AI can detect problematic objects through interpreting and extracting the metadata. This way your app can use the application of AI to monitor harmful and violent content on your platform and protect people’s privacy.</p>



<ul>
<li>Indexing Of Contents</li>
</ul>



<p>Through the application of AI, you can provide better and real-time cataloging of videos on your platform for the users. Used by platforms such as Netflix and Tiktok, this use of AI will bring a better level of personalization in the content that is displayed to the users. </p>



<ul>
<li>Prevention Of Copyright Infringement</li>
</ul>



<p>AI-based video tools can be used extensively to prevent copyright infringement of songs or sporting events. Similar to the way object detection is used to prevent violent content on your platform, you can use AI to protect the copyright of content creators.</p>



<h2 id="step7">7. Scale Your App Faster With Serverless Architecture</h2>



<p>To run an application, you need servers. These servers help you to run the code in the backend. But the problem with traditional physical server architecture is that they need constant maintenance. And that will hamper the growth of your app. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10476 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/serverless-architechture.jpg" alt="live streaming app with live video broadcasting and elastic resizing" width="1650" height="1461" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/serverless-architechture.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/serverless-architechture-300x266.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/serverless-architechture-768x680.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/serverless-architechture-1024x907.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></p>



<p>Which is why when you are building your live streaming app, you should choose to go with a serverless architecture. Despite its name, serverless architecture is not without servers. In this case, the servers are hosted on the cloud with the help of a third-party cloud provider like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" >Amazon Web Services</a>, or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/functions/" target="_blank">Azure Functions by Microsoft</a>. </p>



<p>When you choose to go with a serverless architecture for your live streaming app, the videos and audios streams are collected and then sent to function compute for multiplexing. Multiplexing is a process through which the videos are broken down into smaller pieces for easy and seamless playing.</p>
<p>After the videos and audios have been synthesized, they are sent to CDN, from where the viewers can pull the real-time live stream to watch the multiplexed and synthesized videos. With the serverless architecture, you don’t have to deal with the hassle of server maintenance. You can easily use that time and resource to advance your app.</p>



<h2 id="step8">8. Choose The Right Agency</h2>



<p>While an in-house development seems like a really good idea, it is still a little problematic when you are a small startup trying to get your business up and running. </p>



<p>And that is why it is a great idea to save your in house resources and time, and hire an agency to do the job for you. With the help of an excellent development team from a reputed app development agency, your app can become as big as a Periscope. </p>





<h3>1. Fix Your Budget</h3>



<p>The first thing you need to do before going into the negotiation with any app development agency is to fix your budget. When you enter into a discussion with an agency, the first thing they will ask is how much you are willing to spend.</p>



<p>And this is where you should be honest and clear about your budget and what kind of app you want to build. No matter how great the idea is, money is an important aspect of the entire partnership.  </p>



<h3>2. Do They Have An End-to-end Process?</h3>



<p>The app development agency should always have an end-to-end process. The end-to-end process means a series of steps utilized by the agency to develop their app. With a set process, it is going to be easier for you and the development agency to understand the purpose of the app, the target audience, and what they need in the app. </p>





<h3>3. Review Their Case Study Carefully</h3>

<p>An app building is not just about codes, it’s also about the design. With proper design, the app can scale the market very easily and bring in revenue.</p>



<p>Which is why you need to find out whether the app development agency you have chosen provides the whole packaging, such as coding, design, testing, and testing as well. If the agency provides you with the whole app development package, then it will become easier for you to develop the app. </p>

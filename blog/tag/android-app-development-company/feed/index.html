										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">After the release of Android Studio in 2013, developers found a strong support. A support for developing an app. This IDE (Integrated Development Environment) from Google provides the perfect platform for native <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank">android app development</a>. Equipped with the most prolific features along with advanced characteristics it has offered a boost to the development environment. Cloud computing support with cloud messaging integration gives strength to an android app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Android Studio 2.2 – An IDE Worth Using</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest version of Android Studio comes loaded with three main themes mainly – Smart functionality, speedy execution, and bigger Android platform support. It was first unveiled at the Google I/O this year. Its popularity is due to the advanced features, which gives easy solutions to a complicated application problem. The process of android app development has become quicker and faster with Studio 2.2. New layout editor, APK analyzer, expanded code analysis, enhanced layout inspector are some of the amazing features.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the developer’s point of view, this version comes as a great development tool. It can handle multiple platforms of Nougat 7.0 such as code completion, notifications, quick settings API and multi-window support. Moreover, the built-in emulator is one additional feature that facilitates the process of testing the app. The creation of Android Frameworks along with the constrained layout structure is another added feature in this version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now developers can easily design complicated layouts in a hierarchy fashion. Constraint layout, on the other hand, easily integrates the app in the form of a support library. You can create the library with the latest layout editor. Another good news is that it has more than 20 plus features in each stage of android app development starting from designing to development and testing eases the process. Designing the user interface to making newer constraints and Jack compilers, these are some of the greatest additions to the second version of Android Studio. It is the official emulator of Google to carry out the functions of android app development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Used by millions of developers around the world, there is no doubt that it will facilitate the process of making an app. We are presenting here some of the features of Android Studio which will help you to get a clear idea about the latest feature of the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Can Studio 2.2 Enhance Android App Development?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, the answer will be clear once you get to know about the latest features. So, let us take a look at them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Designing Gets A Facelift</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the new interface designer, you can create a more prominent structure of your app. This is possible with the layout editor. The blueprint mode of the editor enables you to prepare a rough structure. This allows you to understand the attributes of the widget in a clear manner. The constraint layout is a kind of layout manager that enables a developer to make more dynamic user interfaces. While compiled with a layout editor, it really works well. To get an idea of how constraint layout works, take a look below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LeHT8Z3cD5E/V-ATFjJvz5I/AAAAAAAADZo/7IIzBCfZjPQLg1uf3KaeFc67qYft5YK0ACLcB/s640/image00.gif" alt="Android Developers" width="640" height="550" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Image source: https://android-developers.blogspot.in/</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rapid Android App Development</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An upgraded C++ from the Gradle point of view is in operation. It is now possible to migrate projects from CMake to Android Studio seamlessly. In the latest Android version, many bugfixes. Built the sample app with a shared object library and native library with an APK. You can find it in the project wizard of the studio itself. Sample codes are much easier to work with now. In the code editor window, you can now find occurrences in the app and start the process of development fast. Apart from this, with C++, a developer can also make new native files from the directory itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Build Stronger Apps</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To fasten the process of android app development, iteration cycles are the new thing. In Android Studio 2.2, stability and reliability are the two main components. If you have already used a feature of ‘Instant Run’ previously, you should be familiar with the issues. In the latest version, you won’t come across this. Moreover, there is an APK analyzer, which contributes to each of the components. Currently, many new strategies are there to create a cache with incremental build times. There is a facility to enable android.enableBuildCache=true with the grade properties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rigorous Testing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android Emulators are now equipped with virtual sensors. The latest UI controls allow developers to take advantage of Android Sensors like Magnetometer, Ambient Temperature, and Accelerometer. Thus it facilitates the process of testing. Espresso Test Recorder is another addition. It allows you to do UI tests while recording the entire testing process. The tester can even test the application locally using the integration server. With GPU debugger capturing a number of OpenGL ES commands now becomes possible. There’s an option to debug the graphical output for improving the performance of ES command.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With world-class coding experience, debugging facility, flexible built-in system, and instant deployment system, Android Studio 2.2 helps a developer to make high-quality android apps. This IDE from Google eases the process of development. It improves the user experience at the end. Instead of using the traditional present perspectives, Android Studio gives just the right tool to the developers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s the layout editor, APK analyzer, sample browser, and many strong features, which make Android Studio 2.2 more special. Moreover, the Run Window also consists of log messages that one can see while running the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, Android Studio 2.2 will definitely enhance the android app development process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are planning to have some off the shelf android app experience with improved functionalities and zero bugs, then we are ready to give you a robust app. Just send all the requirements of your app by sending an email to <a href="mailto:contacts@unifiedinfotech.net">contacts@unifiedinfotech.net</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile app manufacturers around the world are focusing more on enhancing the customer experience when it comes to offering them a complete app solution. This characteristic is unique irrespective of any mobile operating system for which an app is developed. To keep up in pace with the global demand, even the process of <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/">android app development</a> is constantly under constant modification so that it is able to keep up with any latest updates coming in the devices and can subsequently carry it in the upgraded versions of Android.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, the concept of Android Fragmentation has taken off as newer devices with improved capabilities are coming to the market. In fact, you will be stunned to know that this is due to the fragmentation that even an operating system like Froyo is still in use despite Android N already being available in the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What Was The Need For Fragmentation In Android?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first question that strikes is ‘Why is fragmentation required at all in android app development?’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, the need for fragmentation in Android primarily arose due to the disparity in devices as far as some features are concerned. Being fragmented, one can easily port the features of a particular device to an upgraded version. From a manufacturer’s point of view, the purpose is to make the versions lighter. This is the reason why an android device running on MIUI looks entirely different from a device running on a Nexus device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make it clearer, let us take an example…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a special feature ‘iris scanner’ in Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which is not present in any other android devices. Now, whenever an updated version of Android comes, this particular feature can be ported to that device with the latest version. Being an open source operating system, it becomes easier for the developers to do that. So, why not opt for it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Fragments – Fastening Your Apps</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fragments act as catalyst in speeding up the android app development process. No device rooting is required when you have fragments along with you. It’s interesting to note that how it fastens the process of developing an application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s take a look</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Home Screen Optimization</strong>: If you are suffering from a slow-running software of your home screen then it is time to optimize the screen. Using fragments can fasten your home screen as you can witness a small amount of increase in the home screen. It allows you to reduce the total number of widgets used, thus subsequently reducing the amount of load.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Remove Unnecessary Applications</strong>: There are some apps, which you might not use anymore or rarely use. It takes up the maximum space in the CPU and thus hampers the processing speed. One can identify the apps by going to the task manage with the help of high resource usage. However, it is recommended that you should analyze the app and watch to what extent it causes a problem. If you find the problem is disturbing, then you can uninstall the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Install Customized ROMs</strong>: Latest versions of Android perform faster than the existing ones. This is done in order to reduce the time lag. The benefit of fragmentation is that even if your phone is not updated with the latest version of Android, you can often upgrade it with the help of a custom RAM.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Overclock the Device</strong>: Do you know that just as you can over clock your computer, in the same way, you can also over clock your device? You can at anytime over clock your device if you want it to perform faster. Remember that there is no role of fragmentation here. All you have to do is just properly over clock the device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Is It A Good Or A Bad Thing For Android App Development?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While most of the people have this impression that using a fragment could hamper the process of android app development, but this is a wrong notion as there are ample benefits of fragmentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Transferring Information Between Apps</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since each screen was developed as a separate activity with the android app, it became difficult to transfer the information in between the activities. The object, which has been used, should be globally accessible with a reference. Hence, each screen is treated here as a separate fragment. As a result, the hassle of transferring data is completely passed on to other websites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Making A User Based Interface</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two most commonly used user interface – Tabs and Dropdown menu lists. Each one of them has got their own functionality. While the usability of tabs come when there are few screens. On the other hand, dropdown works well when there are several of them present. The presence of Fragments makes the user interface metaphors easy. As a developer, one has to simply ActionBar in the right mode of navigation. Fragment Transaction helps a user to switch easily between all the displayed fragments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Sophisticated UI Metaphors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the usage of more sophisticated UI metaphors, the need for rich user based design is increasing. Swipe-based navigation is one of the examples where one can easily move between two screens while staying in an application. By adding fragments on each screen, one can place the view page in the user interface layout and connect that to the FragmentPagerAdapter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, with these powerful features, Fragments is definitely a blessing for developing an android app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap Up!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In spite of being complicated, Fragments bring with them an array of benefits as far as android app development is concerned. As a leading android app development company, we have complete expertise in working with android fragments. If you are looking for a digital engagement company, which can make the dream of making your android app into reality, then you can count on us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&#8220;iOS is stale compared to Android! It needs fresh ideas!&#8221; (Says <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/03/is-ios-outdated/" target="_blank">Wired</a>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Last year we heard such comments repeatedly in popular tech or app blogs. That&#8217;s surely a much-debated topic, but open-minded will recommend Apple and Google to swap a few ideas to enrich their OS, as none of the brands can get an upper-hand over one another, both are best in their own way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What features will they likely exchange among each other? What features can inspire their OS? This blog is going to share some good features of Android that iOS users will live to use. In different spirited conversations, experts have found a few selective picks that might gel perfectly with the iOS users.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Users won&#8217;t like iOS turning to Android or vice-versa. So, our view stresses more on freshening iOS with features to help people who are more Smartphone savvy. Apply has a keen eye on the elegant implementation and <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank">Android can surely be the source of inspiration</a> &#8211;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>1. Auto-Correct Options and Spelling Suggestions</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Spelling suggestions by iOS are frustrating. The battles are still on in their latest version (iOS 7). Where does the problem lie?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">You might have been typing a long way, suddenly iOS auto-correct option pops up to tell that the text you wrote is not right. iOS gives a suggestion and if you do not tap on the word it suggests, it will correct on its own. That&#8217;s annoying and irritating. You have to replace the word as iOS does not have any user-editable dictionary. Either you have to type the words as text macros or simply wait for the app to track the right spelling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Compared to iOS, Android gets an upper hand when we type an unknown word, the Android OS suggest a solution above the keyboard. Even if it manages to modify the word that the user does not require, just with a single backspace one can restore the original word. It will make a query whether to add that word to the dictionary to boot. Apple should adopt this feature, to make the text more <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/" target="_blank">user-friendly in iOS</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>2. Contextual Services like Google Now</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Google Now is indeed a vast service which does voice actions like Siri. We won&#8217;t ask Apple to take this away, rather we will ask them to adopt Google Now&#8217;s ability to provide notification and other related services based on contextual information such as location, schedule, whether users are mobile or not, etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Google Now provides routing and traffic notification for places user intends to go, scan user&#8217;s appointments in the calendar. When the user approaches a mass to transmit it displays transportation schedules and informs the user when they come to their point of interest. It can scan your past search history and find out your favorite sports, events, music fests and will offer relevant information on them. Google Now is of ample help to professionals, as it forwards emails and notifications up-to-the-minute. Google Now gives the user the ability to opt-in or out easily unlike Apple, which keeps on filtering emails and reads the GPS location, making it uncomfortable for users.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>3. Quick Access to Notification Center</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There are devices that you might not prefer to use daily. It may be the Wi-Fi or display settings, hotspot or do not disturb button. Android users have the facility to access setting via Notification Center, helping users with a quick and easy way to toggle without jumping all the way out of the app. If you are able to pull the shade while remaining inside a third-party app, the user can still adjust the setting without leaving the app. As for iOS users, such features will be able to decrease the number of taps required otherwise, simplifying usability and enhancing the iOS experience. Even though iOS 7 has a revamped Notification Center, but Android gets a checkmate when you see something in their Notification Drawer and can take action as well as respond without opening whatever app first.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Hitting the Bottom-line!!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Android user enjoys a variety of apps that features more user-friendly outlook compared to iOS. However, both of the OS have their own set of benefits and they can swap it to entail more tailor-made solutions for their users.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Santa Claus arrives every year riding his sledge. The ringing bells give an indication for the celebrations to begin. With another year at the onset, it’s time to celebrate Christmas again with zest. Many online retailers choose <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/" target="_blank">ecommerce website development services</a> at this time of the year. They do this to ensure the best management of their website. However, one critical area, which they ignore, is the security of their ecommerce website. It’s a critical area where a business man should focus especially on the eve of Christmas.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Necessity Of Security For A Website</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike the human brain, which needs occasional intervals, the internet works without a break. It works 24 hours and 365 days a year. Companies need to realize that there is an urgent need to prevent a website them from cyber attacks. Having a website seems to be a great thing from outside. However, one must take sufficient steps to ensure its security. Migrating a brick and store to an online venture involves plenty of risks. Every day the IT world falls victims to cyber threats with the breach in their web security. Christmas and Holidays are the time when retailers must increase their security.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Web servers of big companies have complex codes in them. Ecommerce website development companies help to eliminate security loopholes. These are still the concern of big data organizations. Many programming data on the website depends on the SQL commands and scripts. It depends on the execution strategies of the web server. Web security is an increasing cause of concern today. For information technology companies, data forms an important part. Hence, implementing the right strategies is the key. One must not compromise with websites when it comes to maintaining them. All the data stored here are fragile. They might fall prey to risk anytime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Website owners must keep in mind that systems with so many open ports always have risks. With various scripting languages and many services, this is bound to arise. However, with the correct machines configuration, the risks mitigate. With many frequent updates, it secures a web page more. Coding is another problem. With so many codes from various programmers, one is not sure of the effectiveness. A proper SSL certification ensures faith and confidence in your customers.

Unless you ensure proper regulations, customers won’t come to your website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Our Tips To Keep Your Website Secure During Christmas</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One should not neglect the security of a website especially during Christmas. With orders pouring in from everywhere, the shopping carts are full with surplus items.

An ecommerce website development company, must apply these strategies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 1: Avoid Any Unsuspicious Email</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep a close eye on the kind of emails you receive. Avoid those that ask you to include your name in any campaign. These are the ways to get vital business information regarding you and your business. Make your staff aware about such emails. Educate and aware them about any unsolicited emails.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 2: Go For The Strongest Password</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A stronger password is not the one, which is long, but the one, which is more complicated. Don’t use letters, use symbols. Letters are easier to predict. They are easy to predict, so keep them difficult to imagine. Recommend customers to use strong passwords. If your website, stores vital information such as order and invoice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 3: Store Customer’s Data Safely</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A payment gateway like Paypal, stores all the necessary information of customers. It includes credit card details, mailing address etc. It is your responsibility to make sure that your customer’s data is in safe hands. Keep a database of all customers with their relevant details. On the other hand, take care that you have a reliable web-hosting server.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 4: Create System Alerts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Same person might place multiple orders using different cards. There are many shopping carts, which have default settings in them. They can monitor many things such as track the person using the different card to purchase items. If you sell anything online, then know exactly about the way your shopping cart operates. As an ecommerce website development company, you must suggest the best practices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 5: Keep A Constant Eye On Website</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not possible to keep a continuous eye on your website. Analytics and automated tools can do this hassling task for you. They are like CCTV cameras for your website, which regularly monitors the traffic. A perfect overview of the website helps you to find out any irregular traffic coming to your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 6: Have A Disaster Recovery Plan</strong></p>

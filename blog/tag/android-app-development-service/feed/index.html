										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As per a report, on the first quarter of 2016, 17.2 billion apps were downloaded. Out of those, 11.1 billion were Android apps. Though most of these downloads mostly comprised of games, but the figures prove the growing popularity of such android apps all over the world today. Developers are looking for more advanced tools to create even more inspiring and engaging apps, which would be of use not only to the masses but to the businessmen as well and benefit the human kind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as <a title="Android App Development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank">android app development</a> is concerned, it’s the kind of infrastructure that a developer makes use of which boosts the power of a mobile application. In technical terms, the tools which a developer use is commonly referred as SDK or Software Development Kit. It is the secret for creating phenomenal as well as high-performance apps for Smartphones, tablets, Android wear or Android TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android Studio 2.0 , the official IDE from the giant has everything which a developer cannot even expect from any other SDK. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/6-key-factors-to-consider-while-developing-android-app/" target="_blank">Everything which you need to develop an android app</a> is available in this latest version starting from code analysis tool to emulators and code editors. In this blog, we are going to enlighten you about the various benefits and how it adds more power to a developer’s software development kit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>New Features With More Power</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A bunch of new and powerful features of Android studio 2.0 makes it the ultimate choice for the developers. Let us study which are those.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Instant Run For Instant Results</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole purpose of this latest tool is to increase the developmental work of an application. The ‘Instant Run’ is a new feature that lets the developers accelerate the speed of running, building and editing the cycles. It injects the changes made in the code by implementing it in the app running process. Thus, you do not need to reinstall or redeploy your APK. It can work with any kind of android device that runs on API 14.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Android Emulator For Faster Deployment</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like a nitrox in a vehicle, the emulator speeds up the performance of the CPU, thereby making it work 3 times faster. In fact, when you include ADB, the speed increases to a whopping 10 times faster. Apart from the speed factor, the new emulator also has sensor controls and brand user interface. A host of new capabilities has been added this time to the emulator such as the facility to drag and drop the emulator for faster installation, make use of many touch points and rescaling the window.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cloud Test Lab For Robust Testing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android Studio 2.0 makes the process of testing, one the application is developed. It makes your app run through a series of tests along in Google’s own products. It makes sure that your app does not crash. Moreover, the interface of the Android Studio 2.0 is also such, that it can configure all the tests that have been done on Cloud Test Lab. Google views it as an extension to all the testing processes so that it becomes much easier to perform the tests in all kinds of devices including Smartphones and Tablets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>App Indexing For URL Generation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People looking for your android app in the store will find it more easily. With proper app indexing, Android Studio 2.0 enables you to rectify the URL structure in the app code and lets you add any kind of attributes in the AndroidManifest.XML file. Once you finish adding the URLs to the app, you can validate the app indexing code and start the testing process. One interesting thing about the app is that you can check the validity of the app with the help of the index code, which you have used in the Android Studio.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Debugger Preview For Clear Graphics</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While developing applications for graphical apps, you will now get a GPU debugger with this latest version of Android Studio. It enables you to do a frame-by-frame check. This allows you to find any bugs related to graphics and gives you more information on GL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Future Updates And What To Expect?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On June 2016, Android Studio 2.1.2 was released. Though there haven’t been any notable changes in the update, but only three key updates were made which are given below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Modified LLDB performance and new crash notifications.<br />
2. Security updates.<br />

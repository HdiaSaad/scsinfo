										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials are probably the most talked-about generation today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it is their entitled behavior or how</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/16/millionaire-millennials-avocado-property-coffee.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their obsession with “Avocados” is keeping them from buying a house</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; baby boomers and Gen x-ers have a lot to say about them. But no matter how controversial the generation gets, not considering millennials and their demands when designing a business website is going to be business suicide.<br />
</span><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, before we get into the nitty-gritty of millennial demands and how you are going to fulfill them through web design strategy, let’s look at who millennials really are and why you should be paying attention to them. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elusive Millennials: Why Are They?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make your website Millennials friendly, you have to first find out who millennials are. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12034 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/three-persons-sitting-on-the-stairs-talking-with-each-other-1438072.jpg" alt="three persons sitting on the stairs talking with each other" width="1280" height="854" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/three-persons-sitting-on-the-stairs-talking-with-each-other-1438072.jpg 1280w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/three-persons-sitting-on-the-stairs-talking-with-each-other-1438072-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/three-persons-sitting-on-the-stairs-talking-with-each-other-1438072-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/three-persons-sitting-on-the-stairs-talking-with-each-other-1438072-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, according to the </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report of the Pew research center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most millennials were born between 1981 to 1996, but the people born between 1980 to 2000 are considered to be millennials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What defines this generation is the fact that they have seen the rapid transformation in the technological scenario of the world. Whether we are talking about CRT television to Flat screen LED television, or shopping from small family-owned shops to departmental stores to online shopping, the millennials have seen it all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why it is not exactly easy to trick the millennials. The rapid digital transformation has made them quite aware of what works and what doesn’t, as well as what they exactly need. You need to be paying enough attention to the generation if you want your business to succeed. Want detailed reasons? Follow on to the next point. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why You Should Be Paying Attention To Them?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes the millennial generation so important for your web design efforts?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and foremost reason is the fact that right now, Millennials are entering the prime of their age. People from ages 18 to 34 are dominating the market and changing it with spending habits that are different than the generations that came before them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are three reasons why you should be paying more attention to millennials in your web designing and branding efforts. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now </span>millennials make up three-quarters of the entire US population at 83.1 million people<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.lexingtonlaw.com/blog/credit-cards/millennial-spending-habits.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the average millennial expenditure per year is $47,112. In the US every year millennials altogether are spending $600 billion. </span></li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_12019" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12019" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/credit-card-debt-stats-3-768x390.jpg" alt="web design for millennials" width="768" height="390" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/credit-card-debt-stats-3-768x390.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/credit-card-debt-stats-3-768x390-300x152.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12019" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Lexingtonlaw.com</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials are not impressed by advertisements anymore. According to statistics, </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-to-millennials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84% of millennials do not trust traditional advertising campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by various brands and companies. When it comes to purchasing any products or services, they turn to their family and friends, and online reviews to get suggestions and judge the value of the product. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new thinking and purchasing habits of the millennials have changed the market scenario entirely. And that’s why following the traditional branding and web designing practices is not going to work anymore. Additionally, while looking for expert assistance, millennials do not religiously seek out </span><b>Top Casablanca WordPress Development Agencies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are also on the lookout for companies that leave their signature style and create unique, effective, and yet client-appealing website designs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to first determine the millennial demands when it comes to a product/service website’s design and functionality and then optimize the design accordingly. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting Millennial Demands With Web Design</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we know why millennials are important to the overall success of your business, we can come down to the core topic of this entire article- designing a website for millennials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different from their previous generation, millennials are quite picky when it comes to choosing a product. As the information age generation, they have spent their formative years cruising through the nooks and crannies of the online world. Which kind of makes them experts in all things online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your website is going to be your business representative online. And if you want to appeal to this tech-savvy/online-expert generation, you have to follow their rules and <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">design a website</a> that matches their standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are their demands from a website exactly? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you design a website that’ll match their expectations? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at millennial demands and how you need to design your websites according to that. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Responsive Web Design Strategies: A Must-have</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/09/us-generations-technology-use/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">93% of millennials between the ages of 23 to 38 own a smartphone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and use it every day to perform various kinds of tasks, such as shopping online, browsing social media and conducting research before buying something. So it is kind of obvious that millennial users are looking for a mobile-friendly experience any kind of website they visit. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12020" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12020" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12020 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/london_rag_large_03.jpg" alt="web design for millennials" width="1600" height="1200" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/london_rag_large_03.jpg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/london_rag_large_03-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/london_rag_large_03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/london_rag_large_03-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12020" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://dribbble.com/shots/5336682-Ecommerce-Website-Design/attachments/1157439</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the fact that Google is now rewarding mobile-friendly websites with a better ranking, the millennial demand should also be another reason for you to make your website mobile-friendly. Until the 3rd quarter of 2019, </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile website traffic amounted up to 51.51%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is more than half of the web traffic globally. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12021" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12021" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12021 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/web-traffic-from-mobile.png" alt="web design for millennials" width="512" height="334" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/web-traffic-from-mobile.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/web-traffic-from-mobile-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12021" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you want your website to appeal to the millennial crowd, design your website with responsive web design strategies. Not only is it going to please the millennial users, but it also gets you better ranking on SERPs. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Self-service Option For “Do-It-Yourselvers”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials are known for being the “in-control” generation, whether it is a simple DIY task or a website related query. Contacting customer service is the last thing on their mind when faced with some kind of problem, and they absolutely loathe being put on hold when finally calling customer service. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12022" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12022" style="width: 1341px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12022 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/faq-integrated.png" alt="web design for millennials" width="1341" height="637" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/faq-integrated.png 1341w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/faq-integrated-300x143.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/faq-integrated-768x365.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/faq-integrated-1024x486.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1341px) 100vw, 1341px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12022" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/faq-integrated-podiatry-clinic</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To please this ‘‘in-control” generation, you need to integrate your website with self-service features. Resources such as detailed FAQs, discussion forums for sharing various problems and their solutions, as well as blogs and articles for self-help tutorials, can help you to make your website a self-servicing one. This way your website will be more in tune with the millennial DIY attitude. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Social Media Contact = Getting Popular</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials saw the emergence of social media, and they are still riding that wave till now. From Orkut, and Myspace of the bygone era to today’s Instagram and Snapchat, millennials have seen it all. For them, social media platforms are the perfect way to connect with both people and brands, discover things that help them to enhance the quality of life. They are also more vocal on social media, expressing their views on various matters.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12024" style="width: 1347px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12024 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unified-infotech-footer.png" alt="SCS INFO footer" width="1347" height="637" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unified-infotech-footer.png 1347w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unified-infotech-footer-300x142.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unified-infotech-footer-768x363.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unified-infotech-footer-1024x484.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12024" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you want to become popular among millennials, you have to integrate a way for them to connect with you on social media when designing the website. Being able to connect with you from their social media accounts will not only increase your popularity but also better your chances of getting discovered by more potential users. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Rewards In Exchange For Loyalty</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the </span><a href="https://retailwire.com/discussion/millennials-brand-loyalty-comes-into-question/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how millennials are not at all the “brand-loyal” generation, like their predecessors, many brands and products have gained their loyalty. The challenge is not about gaining the millennial loyalty and approval, it is about how you are going to get that. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12023" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12023" style="width: 1348px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12023 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starbucks-reward.png" alt="web design for millennials" width="1348" height="579" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starbucks-reward.png 1348w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starbucks-reward-300x129.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starbucks-reward-768x330.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starbucks-reward-1024x440.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12023" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.starbucks.com/rewards/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional loyalty programs such as “100th customer of the day” or stacking up loyalty points by spending more on a product doesn’t work on millennials anymore. In order to gain millennial loyalty, you need to integrate unique and new kinds of incentive programs that bring value to them. Whether it is paid subscription for premium features, or various offers, benefits, and discounts with added value, incentive programs that actually care about the user needs is important to gain the loyalty of the millennial clients. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Connect Better With Storytelling</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials want to engage with a product or service they feel connected with. And not just the millennial customer, but almost every generation today want to feel connected with the product, and the best way for you to do that is through integrating storytelling techniques in your website design. </span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/KFVJos0sLohNGJZ5zL" width="480" height="221" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might seem like just another buzzword, but the power of storytelling to build the trust of the user is undeniable. Take the above example. </span><a href="https://bellroy.com/explore/slim-your-wallet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bellroy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a popular company making all sorts of handbags and wallets. On their homepage, through the story like a comparison of two wallets, they clearly convey what they do and what their product is all about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are doing it by integrating meaningful images on the website, or through texts and articles, ensure that your website does not just display a bunch of relevant texts and images to the user, rather actually speaks to them about shared experience, interests and values. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Break The Design Stereotypes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s another thing the millennials are famous for, it is breaking stereotypes. They are the generation that started to break the glass ceiling, and they would appreciate it if your website’s design does the same. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12025" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12025" style="width: 1349px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12025 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/break-the-streotype.png" alt="break the streotype in your web design" width="1349" height="630" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/break-the-streotype.png 1349w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/break-the-streotype-300x140.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/break-the-streotype-768x359.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/break-the-streotype-1024x478.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1349px) 100vw, 1349px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12025" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Globalxplorer.org</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website for </span><a href="https://www.globalxplorer.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Xplorer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the perfect example of breaking design stereotypes. Unlike most websites like this, Global Explorers use a block-like design to p[artually display the people of different cultures. This way they convey the powerful message of how till now we have only taken a brief peek at what these people and cultures represented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So before you think of a design interface, take a good look at your competitors in the same industry, and note down the similar elements on their websites, elements that seem cliche and stereotypical to your industry. And while designing make sure that you don’t include those elements on your website. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Combine Aesthetic With Functionality</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When designing your website, you will be tempted to make it look pretty, despite the lack of functionalism. And of course, a website that’s aesthetically pleasing is always popular with the crowd. But not when it comes to the Millennials. </span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/YppqrONEaOdPBO13xz" width="480" height="210" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website for Woven magazine has integrated both the aesthetic transitions of images and functionality of the navigation. Millennials are fond of functionalism that comes in an aesthetically pleasing package. Which is why you have to design a website that comes with both functionality and looks good. Every element that you use on the website should have a part in enhancing the user experience. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Speed Up The Experience</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not just a millennial specific matter, but yes it is important. Everyone loves a site that’s fast loading and does not drag on the experience. Users today especially millennials have a short span of attention, which can be diverted from your website if it doesn’t load within 3 seconds or less.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/11ASZtb7vdJagM" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how are you going to make your website performance fast and snappy?

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Stand Up For Something</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials didn&#8217;t just grow up in a rapidly changing technological landscape, but also during a rapidly changing socio-political-economic scenario. This has made them more outspoken and passionate about various social causes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the study conducted by Harris Interactive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Millennials are more prone to take a company’s stand of various social issues into consideration before even interacting with them. </span><a href="https://www.conecomm.com/news-blog/new-cone-communications-research-confirms-millennials-as-americas-most-ardent-csr-supporters"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of millennials would not mind making a personal sacrifice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as paying more for a product if the company happens to support a social cause they are passionate about. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12027" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12027 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stand-up-for-something.png" alt="stand up for something" width="512" height="242" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stand-up-for-something.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stand-up-for-something-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12027" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.jnj.com/caring</figcaption></figure>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">11. Keep It (the Content) Light And Breezy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the many complaints against the millennial generation is the fact that they are informal. They would rather wear the casual outfit to work every day and call everyone by their first names rather than Mr. This or Miss. that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, infuriating this millennial tendency is for many out there, it is only because millennials want to shed the excess of action and get to the core of the matter as soon as possible. They want to get up close and personal with issues they are dealing with and don’t like to waste time with formalities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why when designing your website content for millennials, you need to be more direct. Don’t use a lot of formalities and beat around the bush. Keep it light, interesting and fresh (authentic). </span></p>

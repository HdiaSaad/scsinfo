										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has brought everyone to their knees. Since the day it was declared to be a global catastrophe, till right now, it has not only put a stop to normal business processes but has turned the standard industry work processes upside down on its head.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, after more than 6 months, we have settled into this new normal of working from home. But there are still a few questions our clients might have about our work/business process. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it is about our communication process, or productivity and quality of delivery, all these queries and their answers are going to be of paramount importance for you to make the final call about your project.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an establishment that believes in complete transparency, we have heard your questions, and bring the answers to you. So no matter what the questions are, you can find all those answers right here!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/portfolio/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12851 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15.jpg" alt="our portfolio" width="1650" height="1200" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-1536x1117.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></a></p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Transitions: WFO To WFH, How Your Project Is Going To Be Affected?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/">100% transition of work model that appeared within our organization</a> in less than two days had zero impact on our ongoing projects. Keeping in mind the security of our clients, we ensured that they don’t have to travel to the office for any work purposes. Through the necessary migration of infrastructure, we enabled them to keep up the good work right from the safety of their home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pre-existing remote operation model has helped us even more to embrace this new situation. Instead of wondering about what to do in the face of this unique challenge, we have taken advantage of all aspects and ensured that none of our existing and future clients are affected by this crisis.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Disruption In Communication: We Are Always Here!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business person about to hire a web development partner has only one question- how will the partner be able to keep the communication smooth?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely, social distancing and quarantining measurements have made it hard to keep in touch with people. However, having already anticipated these issues, we implemented the right solutions from the very beginning. And after 6 months, we can proudly say that the timely action has paid off </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that further reiterates our earned feather-in-the-cap of being one of the </span><b>Top Casablanca App Development Agencies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using various collaboration tools, such as Skype, Jira, Asana, Slack, Zoom, Trello, Invision we have created a strong communication network within our teams. The interconnected teams with the above-mentioned tools have operated efficiently from the very beginning and will continue to do so till time immemorial (in case things don’t change!).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now the matter of interconnected teams brings us to the next question-</span></p>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Well The Interlinked Processes Are Working In These Times?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaboration is key, and when it comes to more complex projects, such as a tiered web and app development/design process, collaboration happens to be the ultimate element that keeps the work process going.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our client’s (and of course, yours) multifaceted projects, we have integrated agile collaboration methods that help us to not just stay connected, but solve problems even when we are miles away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tried and tested method has been a part of our work process from the very beginning. And now, our Agile teams are able to apply this system to collaborate better on your projects. Using this, we have eliminated departmental silos, enabling our multidisciplinary teams to collaborate across the establishment and deliver quality products.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is The Crisis In Any Way Going To Affect The Quality Of Service? What About Productivity?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the industry-wide sacrifices and compromises, we are still on track to deliver the very best. The crisis is not something we have not faced in the past, but we’ve always had a contingency plan in place for any kind of risk management.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12972 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-1024x492.jpg" alt="corona work from home" width="1024" height="492" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-1024x492.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-768x369.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-1536x737.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-2048x983.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interdisciplinary team members spread out across their homes are in constant touch (figure of speech) with each other through the collaboration tools we have already mentioned, along with the more conventional tools of communication such as emails, phone calls, and video calls.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, we implemented the use of time tracking tools to ensure that our team members can achieve stability between work and life and are always fit (both psychologically and physically) to deliver the highest quality of work.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Happens When Your Point Of Contact Falls Victim To The Virus?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of our Unified team members, from the very beginning of this pandemic, have taken every precaution to prevent falling ill. Our remote operation model ensures that team members don’t have to travel for any work purpose. However, there’s no denying the fact that the virus can not be controlled.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if unfortunately, your point of contact with us does fall ill, we have backup plans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to ensure that our commitment towards the project as repute as one of the </span><b>Top Casablanca User Experience Agencies </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">remains unperturbed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While the sick individual recovers, we can continue with your projects, without any disruption. All our project administrators, developers, and designers are available to help with your site or app at any time.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_6" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Kind Of Help Will You Get From Our Management?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each member of our workforce is ready to support you during this disastrous time. From our management members, you can get precious consultations on how your business can function and succeed in this new normal. Whether you are an enterprise looking to reinvent, or a startup wondering how to make it in the industry, we have all the right advice that is optimized for this new pandemic market.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_7" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is SCS INFO Following The Downsizing Methods Like Everyone Else?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not really! In fact, if anything, our family has only grown in the past couple of months. Judging and understanding the requirements of the current landscape, we were able to develop apps and websites for our clients that leveraged the current needs of the audience out there. This pivoting technique has helped us to garner even more clients and to facilitate their projects, we hired innovative experts from many different disciplines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downsizing during a crisis is not our style. Rather we like to engage the expertise of our teams to improve upon the work even more. And that result is quite clear from our revenue numbers. Additionally, we are also using this work from home time to up-skill our employees.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_8" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Kind Of Training Campaign Do We Have Going On?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our organization-wide training sessions have been designed to include a vast array of technical and development skill training modules. From web development, design, android/iOS design patterns to generic soft skill, we are aiming to help the team members to become even more proficient in their skills. This will help us deliver better results to you!</span></p>
<h2 id="id_8" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Next?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic is not gone, and the slow unlocking process is not picking up speed anytime soon. And in this new normal, we have all strategies in place to keep delivering quality service to you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we can not predict the future, we can tell you about our plans. The work from the home landscape has made us confident in our skill to work remotely without any compromise in quality. Now we can focus on building a global team of designers and developers who can leverage the remote working system. A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd focus</span> in creating quality websites and apps for our clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge &#8211; the forever ‘best friend and worst enemies’ in the Archies comic series? Remember their unending shopping sessions with Archies being dragged behind them?</p>
<p>Well, let’s say, had they been here in 2020, Archie wouldn’t be dragging their shopping bags around. One-click and Betty and Veronica would do all the shopping of their heart’s content &#8211; after all, it&#8217;s the epoch for e-Commerce sites!</p>
<p>And in this Pandemic stricken first half of 2020 (who knows what awaits us in the 2nd half), with social distancing being the quo, what else can we do?</p>
<p>It is these Veronica and Betty who brought about the idea for online shopping, now with COVID-19 on the roll, this is no longer a luxury, but a mandate. While all businesses are striving to capture the online platform, are you still fidgeting about why and how to?</p>
<p>Well, then this is the perfect read for you!</p>
<p>Post the read, you will hold a better vision towards your brand’s online-future. Let’s delve in, shall we?</p>
<h2 id="id_1">1. Numbers Speaking Volumes About E-Commerce Trend 2020</h2>
<p>Kick-starting this read with a few statistics about the prospect that e-commerce holds in 2020 and beyond.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12763" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12763" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12763 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/market-stat.png" alt="market stat" width="512" height="361" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/market-stat.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/market-stat-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12763" class="wp-caption-text">Source: statista.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of these numbers are predictions for the year 2020 and will possibly supersede the expectations, many thanks to COVID-19, and its brought about a storm of e-commerce.</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">An approximated <a href="https://ecommerceguide.com/ecommerce-statistics/">95% of all purchases will be made via e-commerce platform by 2040</a>.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://hi.photoslurp.com/blog/ecommerce-statistics-coronavirus-covid/">58% of online brands</a> are of the faith that COVID-19 will affect buyer confidence. 22% of them believe that this effect will be significant.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Owing to the pandemic outbursts, the online sectors of Home Entertainment, Health and Wellness, Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods, Telecommunication, and Technology will undergo major boost <a href="https://hi.photoslurp.com/blog/ecommerce-statistics-coronavirus-covid/">over the next 6 months</a>.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As per the research conducted, an estimated 80%<a href="https://hi.photoslurp.com/blog/ecommerce-statistics-coronavirus-covid/"> of respondents in Europe</a> have said that they would be preferring to shop for the non-essential items post the Coronavirus crisis.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a look into the commodity online shopping (as of May 31, 2020)</li>
</ol>
<p>With such promising numbers for the E-commerce sector, this COVID-19, and the ensuing span of uncertainty over health issues even post the breakout, the future of online shops looks promising enough. Taking a cue from this, businesses can be rest assured to step on this boat and progress with their business expansion endeavors. Here come the two of the spearheading questions &#8211; how and why. Let’s start on with this section of the topic!</p>
<h2 id="id_2">2. Accelerating The Business Growth With E-Commerce During Pandemic Times</h2>
<p>The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus hit the world and its economic drop back like never before. As it emerged, the globe wasn’t prepared for this ‘Black Swan’ of a situation. The digital world was a step ahead but, with its slowly escalating progress in the field of online shops. However, with COVID-19, this pace of catching up to the online shopping platforms was boosted considerably.</p>
<h3>A. The How</h3>
<p>With businesses, prior to the pandemic outburst, had an option &#8211; to go online or not, but now with the novel virus on the global roll for an indefinite period, there are no options &#8211; they <i>HAVE </i>to go online.</p>
<p>Subsequently, all trades are in the race to set up their branding face over the online platforms. In this rat-race of a situation how to set up your online shop &#8211; one that &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Appeals to clients,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Lures them from your Top of the Funnel content to the purchasing point, and</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Gains their loyalty?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how &#8211;</p>
<h4>Keep The Product Content And Information Relevant And Accurate</h4>
<p>Clients &#8211; a majority of them are new to the online shops, especially for their daily merchandise. The last thing that they need is a dispute between the product description and the original merchandise.</p>
<p>Your online shop thus necessarily needs to comprise relevant links to scientific and medical authorities and rich content, irrespective of the market relevance of the product.</p>
<p>Ensuing this, your products must be discoverable, one that caters to the cross-sell and search.</p>
<p>Categorize the products under the relevant categories so as to ensure that they appear in the perfect searches.</p>
<h4>Implement Fair Marketing Price</h4>
<p>Running a yield-based pricing system or a marketplace? In both these cases, it is a mandate that you opt for a fair marketing price, one that wouldn’t frustrate your clients and not put you on the wrong side of the online shopping authority-guidelines.</p>
<h4>Accurate Delivery Dates Are A Must</h4>
<p>Imagine this &#8211;</p>
<p><i>You order a list of commodities whose delivery is dated a week from the date of order. The order arrives a week late. Would you, as a consumer, go back to the brand for another order? You would have, had there been no competitors. However, now you are spoilt for choices. </i></p>
<p>As a brand-owner, with a newly launched online shop, remember this instance. One such priority is the maintaining of the delivery date as mentioned in the site. This surely establishes the credibility of your brand and ensures the retaining of loyalty towards your brand.</p>
<h4>Out-Of-Stock Items Need To Be Labeled Accurately And Show No Tabs For Order</h4>
<p>A nominal and simplistic step at the initial look, but this forms the line between a well-developed e-commerce site and the one that is not. The sold-out commodities appear in your product list sans the warning that they aren’t available and your potential clients are easily misled. The result &#8211; a huge adverse impression of your site. Now, that isn’t something that you would want, right?</p>
<h3>B. The Why</h3>
<p>Businesses are leaving behind a Hansel and Gretel trail of breadcrumbs via their setting up of the online shops. This would be effective in luring prospective clients towards their brand. Subsequently, it would transform these potential clients into its existing counterpart.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, why this sudden shift to the online platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">via the expert assistance of the </span><a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/ecommerce/new-york/new-york-city"><b>Top Casablanca eCommerce Development Agencies</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially during the first half of 2020? Needless to say, this has a lot to do with the novel virus on the loose amongst other factors. The latter has been listed below –</span> &#8211;</p>
<h4>The Obvious: Lockdown And Social Distancing</h4>
<p>COVID-19 is being said to have taken the globe a few years back over the chances of a dipping economy. However, the trade-world has found a way out of this over their e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>The only way out during the social distancing and the lockdown is to give power to the convenience factor over launching e-commerce platforms that ensure contact-free delivery of services and products. What better a solution than online shops with orders just a click away and an appropriate site that caters to the latest eCommerce web design trends!</p>
<h4>Offline Mode Will Soon Become Archaic</h4>
<p>Old customer methodology is set on its way to becoming archaic soon. While the requirements of clients to want to discuss business deals face-to-face remains the same, the feasibility of it becomes narrowed down with social distancing norms.</p>

<h2 id="id_3">3. Covid-19 And Businesses Challenges &#8211; Cause And Effect Relationship!</h2>
<p>While the prospect for eCommerce looks bright enough, there is something that needs to be taken into consideration &#8211; the trading world, as we knew of, till the pandemic breakout, wasn’t prepared to go all out into the online shops. Subsequently, it is obvious that the business realm is facing significant hurdles over going online.</p>
<p>Albeit acknowledgment of the challenges, meeting them with the best possible solution to the same is nearly impossible.</p>
<h3>A. The Challenges That Businesses are Facing</h3>
<p>Here are the challenges and their solutions to ensure that enterprises can launch in their updated and flawless online shops to engage their potential and existing clients ad enhance their experience.</p>
<h4>An overpowering e-Commerce storm</h4>
<p>E-commerce came on too fast, too strong for the trading world, it seems; leaving brands with too little a time to catch up with this storm. Then there is the issue with updating the online platform to match up with the trending eCommerce business trends and the digital techniques, website developments, and designs.</p>
<h4>Mushrooming competitors</h4>
<p>It seems like the entire trade-globe is going all out on investments and adding digital edges to their e-commerce approaches. With growing competitors in the field comes the imminent threat of better offers and discounts, and hence, divided clientele, considerably risking their revenue.</p>
<h4>Inadequate ICT infrastructure</h4>
<p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure has been a persistent struggle in the e-commerce sector during these times of pandemic. This often leads to a lack of capacity and awareness and issues with internet access. The issues are common with consumers and MSMEs.</p>
<h4>Promoting Usability</h4>
<p>Promoting usability is a prime concern for all trades going online. Sans this factor, it is near impossible to reach out and lure in your clients. However, the issue with promoting usability is updating the site consistently to meet the client’s varying changes.</p>
<h4>Regulatory and enforcement failures</h4>
<p>With pandemic on the loose, there is a failure of the uniform classification across various states in terms of diverse essential items. Despite the government permitting the delivery of essential goods, industry experts are of the opinion that multiple service providers are having hiccups with the procurance of permit passes. This runs valid for staff supply in each of the states.</p>
<p>While this is time-consuming, it has a substantial impact on client usability and experience.</p>
<h4>Creating customer appeal</h4>
<p>Customer requirements vary over time. Diverse client needs, make it difficult to map the same, and cater to the needs. Since creating customer appeal is largely based on this, it is obvious that the creation of customer appeal is a mammoth task.</p>
<h4>Enhancing customer experience</h4>
<p>What do you think eCommerce Web Design Services and development trend does to your client experience?</p>
<p>Well, It enhances the experience!</p>
<p>Since they are a constant and consistent update line, businesses would need to dedicate a team for their expertise. This is a new arena for the brands new to the online line of shops and hence the lagging.</p>
<h4>Broken supply chains</h4>
<p>A blurred distinction between the &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Stakeholders with importance to the commerce supply chain, and</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Stakeholders with no importance to the e-commerce supply chain</li>
</ol>
<p>-result in a broken supply chain that affects the service providers. The ultimate result? &#8211; a jammed demand cycle on account of the ripple effect on the timely delivery of consumer services and goods.</p>
<h4>Focus on websites &#8211; creation and update</h4>
<p>Updates and creation of websites are an absolute mandate for e-commerce sites. This has a lot to do with the existing competition in the market. The online shops need to be regularly updated with the trends in eCommerce industry to ensure that the site catches up to the needs of the Google algorithm and the clients as well.</p>
<h3>B. The Solutions</h3>
<p>While enterprises lie in the pool of unknown territories in the digital online front, the solutions are being put ahead by the pros in the field. All that they need to do is follow up with the eCommerce business strategy and be rest assured about a result-yielding site.</p>
<h4>Reset the branding evaluation with e-commerce sites</h4>
<p>When a brand meets its promised delivery date and offers quality merchandise and service, its brand label is re-evaluated and the clients get a new angle on the brand.</p>
<p>This is easily feasible over a well-functioning e-commerce site, one that is updated as per the latest eCommerce business trends and caters to the client requirements.</p>
<p>You can always approach your chosen best web designing eCommerce web design company in Casablanca and let the experts lead you towards the very best.</p>
<h4>Eliminating customer-brand friction</h4>
<p>Developing a brand-client relationship is one of the utmost important things that enterprises need to concentrate upon. Transparency about the brand &#8211; value via a well-developed e-commerce site ensures diminished brand-client friction.</p>
<h4>Smoothening payment gateways in websites</h4>
<p>Payment in e-commerce sites is a considerable hurdle that brands need to deal with. The first step in this regard is an offering of multiple payment modes accompanied by a completely secured SSL-certified site. This fetches the client’s confidence on your site via a credible brand image. With the spiked cases of cyberthreat over payment gateways, this is a crucial aspect, one that needs immediate addressing.</p>
<h4>Enhanced security of websites</h4>
<p>An e-commerce website sans the enhanced security aspects is as good as non-existent. What enterprises need to understand is that with online sites, clients are non-reliant on poor security sites since they are soon subjected to pursue the payment procedure.</p>
<h4>Convenient navigation across shopping-options</h4>
<p>With online shops, one of the primary expectations of clients is a clear interface with a smooth navigation facility. A site that would help them</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">With the categorization of merchandise and products and</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Let them smoothly shift from one page to the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means no digital glitches and maybe some animated 404 error pages to improve brand-image even during times of internet issues.</p>
<h4>Increase digitization in supply chains</h4>
<p>The digitalization of the supply chain is an absolute must to patch up the existing inefficiencies and accelerate the progress in the supply chain. This would upgrade the chain substantially and add to its value.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves better if you concentrate on &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Prioritizing data as an integral differentiator and asset</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Managing cost to maximize the runway</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Preparing for any future ‘Black Swan’ situations</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="id_4">4. Another Bumble-Bee In A Post-Pandemic World &#8211; Digital Transformation</h2>
<p><i>“Ok, Siri! How to </i><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/digital-transformation-strategy/"><i>digitally transform your business for 2020 &amp; beyond</i></a><i>?”</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning of the Global pandemic of COVID-19, a.k.a Coronavirus, the main problem we have all faced is the lack of a unified source of information and communication. The online world scattered with both reliable and unreliable sources of information have only made the situation worse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding this problem, SCS INFO teamed up with one of their most prominent Australian clients to create an app that will act as the main source of information for Australian users. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Started With An Idea</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the very beginning of this situation, the lack of reliable information turned out to be one of the main problems. As the people all around the world started to struggle against the pandemic without any combined source of information and communication, we teamed up with our Australian clients to design and develop an app that can save people during this situation.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12407 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min-1024x915.png" alt="covid-19" width="1024" height="915" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min-1024x915.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min-300x268.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min-768x686.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min-1536x1372.png 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min.png 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea is simple- providing a straightforward gateway for communication and information to the users. It is not only about having the most important facts but what they are going to do about it and how they are going to take the right steps. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Features Maketh The App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designed specifically to give the users an edge in this fight, the app for COVID-19 is armed with all the right features and functionalities.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Contact Groups</span></h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Information</span></h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. My COVID Risks</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “My COVID Risks” feature is a unique feature that enables the users to understand whether they are going to contract the disease or not. With this feature, the users simply have to answer a few questions and the app will provide the users with results based on their answer. The feature is designed to provide the users with proper guidance and reduce panic among them. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Review My Results</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature will help the users to check out their results and keep a track of results based on previous queries. This way they can rest assured and know when they have to contact the medical services. </span></p>

With no vaccination available just yet, the only three steps we can take is to responsibly follow protocols, stay informed about what to do, and self isolates until it’s safe to go out. And with our app, the users might find it a lot easier to do the first two steps. </span></p>

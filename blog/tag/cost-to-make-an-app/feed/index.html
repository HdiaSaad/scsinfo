										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The popularity of mobile apps is going up today. And that is a well-known fact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is not a well-known fact is how much does it cost to build a mobile app. Think about it for a second. Everyone keeps telling you how amazing the app market is today, and how there is an app for every scenario. And encouraged by their words, you go ahead with your application idea, without finding out anything about how much it is going to cost you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting into app development without knowing anything about the cost of development is going to be harmful to you and your business. But when you search on the internet about it, you will only get fragmented results on what affects the mobile software development process and some vague figures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this article, we are going to give you a detailed look at the factors affecting the cost of development that can give you a clear idea of what your budget should be. So without further ado, let&#8217;s start talking about the cost of making a mobile app.<br />
</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps To Asses The Cost Of App Development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of key factors that’ll affect the development cost. Take notes because we are going to talk about these in detail. </span></p>
<ol class="scrollspy-links">
<li><a href="#step1"> Find the app type</a></li>
<li><a href="#step2"> Fix the platform</a></li>
<li><a href="#step3"> Figure out the functionality of the app</a></li>
<li><a href="#step4"> Finalize the design and development</a></li>
<li><a href="#step5"> Deployment</a></li>
<li><a href="#step6"> Maintenance</a></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are the key factors that are going to drive the price for the development of your app? Let’s have a look.</span></p>
<h2 id="step1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Determine The App Type</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you think about “how to make an app?” think about “what is the type of my app?”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the type of application is the first key factor that will affect the cost of development. Choosing the app type early is going to help you plan out the entire development journey complete with the cost estimation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As app owners, When it comes to choosing the type, you have two options. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hybrid Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hybrid or cross-platform apps are built using a combination of native and web technologies. The creation and maintenance cost for these applications are comparatively low, and on top of that, they reach a larger audience than native or web apps. This is because a hybrid app can run on all OS like iOS, Android</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to achieve a balance between balance and performance through your mobile application is to choose a native approach. Built for specific operating systems, such as Android or iOS, these apps have different technological built as well as different software to build them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the complexity of these applications, the price of development can be a lot higher than the above mentioned two. But despite the expenses, these apps are also high in demand among the users.</span></p>
<h2 id="step2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. The Platform You Choose</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This point is for those who chose the native approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you choose the native application development, you will be presented with another question-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you pick Android or iOS to build an app?</span></p>
<figure style="width: 870px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7ETEhMchKEgaf9xdjRpuxUQ0T8bDm7UJghewDi6_HOUaP5YfS7cDPAvC4NaSLdKVe7cLRS8cDGL89A76L0ftKBuu2x9MdmPptYqewK2fDHuqzVxHdErm7BZOGFPb6e09tEYo2r8" alt="cost of mobile app development based on ios vs android" width="870" height="550" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.mobileappdaily.com/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you will be tempted to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create an Android and iPhone app, both at the same time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because when you pick both, you will get access to a larger audience base. Right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assessment is accurate, however, it is not very future safe. When you work on the development of both platforms, you create a big risk for your business venture. The development process can get messy, and the average cost to make an app will increase more than necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that is why you need to choose a platform at the initial stage of development. However, before making this choice you need to keep in mind some extra factors so that the platform choice benefits your business. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market Share</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, it may have seemed like iOS was taking over the market with their exclusivity and special features. However, according to the below chart, as you can see, Android apps are currently ruling with a whopping 75% share of the global smartphone market. </span></p>
<figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kLFU5hCd6SjFgiBNgY6GbQliv3xXkQHzvtjJOTY6rEKGXM3yAlSWJg-HZIiJh5we9EEyeer53BMzi6k3Yuhn_vJqAK5RjAnhf0WIJ1tOS8wGaBAsjezofbNKZHI4NaS98-HFzbs" alt="market share of cost of mobile app development" width="1280" height="720" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://gs.statcounter.com/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you aim to reach a higher number of users in a small amount of time, then you should go with Android as your preferred platform for application development.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Development Complexity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complexity of development should be another factor you need to keep in mind when choosing between Android and iOS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When faced with the question, remember the problem of fragmentation the developer might face with Android app development process. Android is an operating system that has a large range of smartphones built by many companies across the world. Developing an app that fits all the Android devices is something incredibly complex, and it is going to affect the cost of development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With iOS, you don’t have a similar problem, because the diversity of devices is not that large when it comes to iPhones. There are a limited number of devices that run on iOS and the OS is always updated to the latest version as well. So building an app for iOS is going to be easier than developing one for Android, and as you should know already, “easier = more affordable”.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deployment Process</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">iOS apps may be faster and easier to develop, but they make up for it during the deployment process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By that we mean, when it comes to app launching on the app stores, iOS has a stricter approval process than google play store does. And on top of that, the Apple App Store will charge you an annual fee of $100 every year, while the Google Play Store is only going to charge you a one-time $25. When it comes to the app deployment process, deploying an Android app is going to be easier and more affordable for you than iOS. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue Generation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not the least, you need to consider the kind of revenue you are going to make with your app. And when it comes to revenue, iOS is going to be a better choice for you than Android. According to the</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/11/app-store-generated-93-more-revenue-than-google-play-in-q3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Apple earned 93% more revenue from app downloads than Google play store on by the third quarter of 2018. So if generating revenues is your main aim with your app, then you should choose iOS. </span></p>
<h2 id="step3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Functionality (What Does Your App Do?)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The functionality of your app means what your app does. For example, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel app development cost is going to be more than that of a simple clock app because of the difference between functionality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the phase where you have to shortlist the app features and functionalities your app is going to showcase. The business logic behind your app will affect the complexity of your app, the audience for it, and ultimately the cost of development. So make sure that you figure out the proper functionality for your app. </span></p>
<h2 id="step4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Design And Development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design and development are the two pillars of the mobile application development process. These are the two steps for which you will have to do all your research, and without these two stages, all your planning and ideation is for nothing. </span></p>
<figure style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/97hB-eUNMvuNv3OjFl7iFsAb-B1cdRxKq8czP41DSM_Jd1uurcrAUq56zGnHzjS55p_jVSY2B9yK7A9yR6uz3_r6vdbVrb3UCnnJ_VQ95Wd-SOzO_ejYs-tVlZfv0cz3bvfpXLQ" alt="how much does it cost to make an app with design and development" width="1600" height="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Creatively designed food app by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design can be a powerful element that convinces the user to install your app, and such a powerful design is going to cost you a fair bit. Employing a high-end designer will harvest more bucks than an inexpensive UI/UX designer. For your app, you have to choose a UI/UX designer who can appeal to the target demographic with their design skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for development, it is the most important part of the development process. This is the stage where the structuring, layout, etc all happens. When the development process is done robustly, it’ll do 50% of the work. Here, the cost slab is heaviest. It takes time, and the price keeps fluctuating depending on the software and programming language, and the kind of code used for the development process.</span></p>
<h2 id="step5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Testing Your App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make your app truly flawless, it requires rigorous testing. With the testing process, you can be assured that your app is functioning the right way on different operating systems and devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways you can test out your app- the automated testing, and manual testing. The cost of manual testing is a little higher than the cost of automated testing. But to make sure that your app is without any bugs, you have to invest in both kinds of testing. You might be tempted to cut out the testing phase from the entire development process to save time and money, but that will only make your app suffer.</span></p>
<h2 id="step6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Deployment Process</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have already mentioned previously that Google charges a one time fee of $25 while App store charges a $99 fee annually every year for publishing your app.however you should also know that on top of these expenses, if your app has an in-app payment mode, you will have to pay a 15% tax to both the major application stores for every purchase made on your app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of deployment is easy to miss when you are developing an app, so make sure that you count these in when assessing the development cost.</span></p>
<h2 id="step7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Maintenance </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maintenance cost is not something that is included in the average cost of developing a mobile app.. Maintenance and updates happen after the development is done with and the app is already launched into the market. But think about it this way- as app owners, the moment you get started with your software development process is the moment you sign up for these later costs as well. So it is better to consider them early rather than later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you hire an agency to develop your app, they will charge the maintenance cost as a yearly prepaid amount.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonus Features That Might Drive Up The App Development Cost</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the stages and extra features, there are plenty of external factors that affect the cost of development for your mobile application. These factors are not going to be a direct part of the development cost, but at the same time, they will have significant influence over it. What are these factors? Let’s have a look. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Of Third Party Services</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your app functioning on its own? Do you have to use a third-party a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pp development software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build the app? Or is it taking data from another service? Usually, most apps interact with third-party APIs, at the enterprise level. This adds to the cost in terms of periodic maintenance charges for the APIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if your app is self-dependent then you can look into other factors. But in case your app uses any third-party SDK and tools or has third-party integration, be sure that it will contribute to your cost to develop an app.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigation System</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you install an app, one of the first things you want is smooth navigation. Surfing through pages, options, links should be convenient enough. Good navigation is a direct indication of a good user interface. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_10041" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10041" style="width: 1988px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10041 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/easy-search-and-find.jpg" alt="easy navigation for users defining cost of app development" width="1988" height="974" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10041" class="wp-caption-text">We designed and developed the easy navigation for users</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">App creation cost for this feature incurred depends on the complexity and build. So make sure you spend a good amount of time deciding on the budget for this. It usually takes a minimum of 10 hrs and cost can vary depending on who you hire for the development of the app.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">GPS</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many applications, especially taxi apps, dating apps, travel apps, etc have this feature as their defining traits. It depends of course on the type of app you want to develop, especially if it falls in the above-mentioned category. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_10040" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10040" style="width: 1988px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10040 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/location-tracking-GPS.jpg" alt="location tracking with GPS for mobile app cost breakdown" width="1988" height="974" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10040" class="wp-caption-text">How we created the advanced GPS tracking</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With increasing population and urban diversity, geolocation has become more important with time. Such an innovative feature usually takes around 50 hrs to develop and integrate into the app.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multilinguality</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an important feature to consider if you want your app is made for cross-cultural usage. Many countries around the world would rather communicate in their native tongue rather than English, like the European countries of France, Spain, Italy. And that’s why if you want to reach all these countries with your application, you should consider multilingual functionality for your app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how much does it cost to make an app for integrating different languages? An app with language preference would be preferred more than if it strictly uses English as the only mode of communication. Plus your market share would increase exponentially. Working on this requires 15 hrs of development on the part of the app builders. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offline Facility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t always have a data connection. Even with portable wifi devices, there might be problems with the connections. And that’s why you might need an offline facility in your app. </span></p>
<figure style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uhV5MLPY9alZkQD42Ny03BZgLT7E9rA8TCYjysiyEOjN5znkXWvqUwrx6Sgf1lj-95NDZMYfPQ4m3lsztyCe-y-q2lMjZbB8Hiss9nnVG7n8IJeHAyUpIZgyoz1rG7Y1SIhHflE" alt="how much does it cost to make an app for offline mode" width="1600" height="791" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.idownloadblog.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to be on the competitive edge you should consider this feature for your app. It would not only save your users from spending too much internet data, but it’ll also turn your app into one of the most useful tools in the market.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">External Factors That Affect App Development Cost</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the stages and extra features, there are plenty of external factors that affect the cost of development for your mobile application. These factors are not going to be a direct part of the development cost, but at the same time, they will have significant influence over it. What are these factors? Let’s have a look. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much does it cost to build an app in different countries? Different countries different currency rates against the US dollar. It determines the price of commodities and services as well as mobile applications. Hiring developers from development companies in different countries will cost you differently.</span></p>
<figure style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9r9qTeL8WVSXJuW56A8lrXhW7waMw-tp3m_SkS-Hoh4freweQss3RtzcLy5eMC3vy0s6maCZWM4NZUJucGn2UEx0E3wZ1IY0Afph-PiPoRU2waINlVhmd7xLh57aDuRl0uQgyWw" alt="how much does it cost to make an app stats" width="1000" height="743" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.statista.com/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So before you choose an offshore agency or an agency in your own country, consider the location-wise mobile app development cost for you.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">App Development Agency Or Freelancer</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owners of big enterprise can choose to build an in-house developers team for all their app needs. But if you are just a small startup, you have to decide whether you want to choose between a freelance developer or app developers from a development agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to be careful while choosing app developers and make sure how much app developers in MAcost because it will affect your app in the long run. As a startup, it might seem beneficial to you to hire a freelance developer. They charge less and seem like the perfect solution for a startup, but at the same time they are not exactly bound to their client by the kind of legal contracts an app development agency would be. Which means they can leave any time they want to. And on top of that, they give no guarantee for the product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then we have the various app development agencies. They are not only going to serve you with high-quality work but also some form of guarantee for your app and fulfill all your app requirements. An agency is going to be bound to various regulations such as the time limit and the budget. Sure they will charge you more than the freelancers, but in the long run, it will be beneficial for you to choose an app development agency over freelancers. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Development Time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are millions of apps in the market. All of varying sizes and measurements. So naturally, the time involved in their development takes their respective durations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time of development will fluctuate, depending on the platform, complexity and functionality of the apps and the skills of the developers. More time, more expense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But also, multi-faceted apps offer diverse functionalities which are preferred when compared with the ones providing single functionality. You have to choose the right option for tackling the cost, as well as gain a competitive edge in the market.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing your app may seem like a trivial thing and you might think that your app doesn’t require it, but it is nonetheless an important one. Another factor that is not directly connected to the development of your application, and yet, will have a serious influence on your the cost of your app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing actions taken for your app can increase your app’s all-around reach. Some app development agency offers to do the marketing for your app as an extra service on top of app development service. However, you can also hire a dedicated marketing agency for this. Depending on what your choice is, the cost can go up or down. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimate Cost Estimation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how much does it cost to develop an app?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know you might be expecting a set figure at this point for your customized mobile software. But there’s no set figure when it comes to cost estimation to develop an app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As vague as it sounds, it still stands true. There are too many varying factors that need to be considered, and that’s why it is really hard for us to pinpoint a figure of sum for you and tell you “this is how much your app will cost.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way you can get a proper estimation is by sitting down with a reputed application agency and hash out your app idea, the feature requirements, and all its functionalities. And depending on that talk, the agency will be able to give you a clear idea of how much it’ll cost to build your app. </span></p>

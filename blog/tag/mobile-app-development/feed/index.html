										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know some really cliche lines like</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The home is where the heart is”, or “home sweet home”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However cliche these lines may seem like, home is the closest place we have to heart. After all, it is THE place we can come back to after a long day and just take a nap!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying a house is not an easy process. You have to go through various property listings, talk to agents, sort through paperwork and complete many other duties. This complication of process calls for a simple solution, and that solution is real estate apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you think that as a startup you can provide that solution, then this article is for you. If you want to create your own real estate app like Zillow but don’t know how then this article is going to give you all the details you need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From idea validation to all the steps that it takes to build such an app (no pun intended!) and then some unique integrations, we are going to discuss it all.  So without any delay, let’s look at the steps you need to follow first. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a Real Estate App like Zillow &#8211; Brick by Brick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like a difficult thing to do, but building a real estate app is extremely easy, especially if you follow these steps…</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s create a real estate app now!</span></p>
<h2 id="Validate_your_real_estate_app_idea"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1st Brick: Idea Validation: Why You Should Create Your Own Real Estate App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about the validity of the idea before talking about realtor app builder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first glance, the idea of such an app seems a little ridiculous. Because buying and selling houses is something that has been done without any apps or software for decades. So why suddenly use an app now?</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11399" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11399 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map.png" alt="average rent prices" width="900" height="639" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map.png 900w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map-300x213.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map-768x545.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11399" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Rentcafe</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look into the image above, the high rates of rents are proof of why people are looking to but their own homes rather than giving rents. With real estate apps like Zillow and Trulia in Casablanca and California, the real estate industry is one step closer to digitization, helping to make the complicated process of home buying easier. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Better for mobility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it going to be easier for users to use their smartphones for property browsing? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes. They are using their phones for every other task anyways. If you <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/">make the right app</a>, users can look for property on the go with these apps. There’s no need to visit every prospective house and location they see fit. They can check out the details of the house or the apartment from the app and visit if it matches their requirements. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Location centric</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a geolocation feature on every smartphone and that m2akes it easy to make location-centric searches. So it’s not surprising when the users can make location-centric searches and find the places nearby without any hassle. Zillow real estate app makes it easy. Take a note here.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Instant notification</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an instant age and people like things instantly. They don’t want to wait for weeks to get details on a property, they want those details instantly, or at least want to know instantly when the details are becoming available. And that’s how real estate apps are becoming crucial for the users on their path to find the perfect home. </span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s see how real estate mobile app development is helping the industry professionals-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Providing Better Customer Support</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real estate business is a complicated one, but if you create your own real estate app, you can ease the pain. The clients need proper customer support to actually get through this. And an app is going to be the perfect tool for that. The features such as constant and direct connection with the clients are going to make it easy to build a healthy relationship with the clients. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. The Direct Marketing Facility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate apps are the best instrument for directly marketing your business to the clients. There is no interruption of a third party or spam. Not only it will bring in more clients and therefore more business and revenues, but it will also keep the clients engaged with your business.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">F. Stand Out Among The Competition </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an app, you will get a better understanding of your clients as well as stay updated with the popular market trends. Not to mention, with a specialized app for buying and selling property, you will be able to stand out in the market and get more clients easily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have validated the idea of real estate app development, we need to talk about the two distinct types of app you can build. </span></p>
<h2 id="Know_the_app_types"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2nd Brick: Know The App, Know The Types</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you hire any freelancer or real estate app development company, you need to understand the app types. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to mobile app development for real estate, there can be two types of apps depending on how they function. The first one is an agency based app, and the second one is a third party app. How these apps function? Let’s see-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. The Agency App</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency app, just like its name, belongs to the specific real estate agencies. Working as the digital face of the business, the agency app lists all the houses under their listing, has all their agents listed for easy access of the users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the agency app, the agency can keep track of their business improvements, how many clients are engaging with their agency, and what their demands are. It is basically an improved tool for business management and improvement. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. The Third-Party Model</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third party or the aggregator model works as the mediator between the buyers and the agents. The workings of the third party model is a little different than the agency app.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can sign up either as buyers/sellers or freelancer agents. The freelancing agents can upload their own listings and expand their network through the app.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user, on the other hand, can contact the agents nearby, browse through their listings, look for houses they are interested in. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sellers can sign up and contact the agents about the property they want to sell. The third-party app basically becomes a platform for the agents and the buyers/sellers to easily and instantly communicate. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have decided on the app model, the next step is going to be planning the right real estate mobile app features. </span></p>
<h2 id="Plan_out_the_app_features"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3rd Brick: Planning the Futuristic features</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like manners maketh man, the features maketh an app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why you have to be careful about picking the right features for your app. The right real estate mobile app features can help your app become more functional and useful for the users. You can also go for a whiteboarding session with <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/">a reliable mobile app development company based out in Casablanca</a> to get the feel of the market. So what kind of features does your real estate app need? Here is a list-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Login/Signup</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By signing up the users can create a personal account where they can save various information and preferences, search histories, etc. There are a few ways this feature can be implemented-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can sign up using their mail ID or phone number. It is also important that you implement the social media signup feature. With this feature, the users can sign up using just one tap. Make sure that the app is easily accessible from the login/signup phase.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. View/Edit Profile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the ability to create a profile, the users should have the ability to view and edit their profiles as well. The users can add and edit their details, search histories, preferences, etc. This feature will not only let them personalize their profiles but also make their app experience better. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Filter &amp; Search</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users are going to use various keywords to look for the right property. This means that your app is going to need a robust search and filter feature. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11441" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11441" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11441 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property.png" alt="create a relate estate app with property searching feature" width="1650" height="1276" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-300x232.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-768x594.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-1024x792.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11441" class="wp-caption-text">Real estate app designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search feature needs to be incredibly accurate so that the users don’t have to search too long for a location. And to make it more accurate, you need to add a filter option as well. With this option (also present in Zillow mobile app), the user can filter properties by location, prices, type, ratings, etc. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Mapview</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For property searches, the map feature becomes incredibly important. With this feature the user can easily navigate new locations, routes, look for specific landmarks near the properties, etc.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11442" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11442" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11442 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view.png" alt="create your own real estate app with map view" width="1650" height="1276" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-300x232.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-768x594.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-1024x792.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11442" class="wp-caption-text">Created by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another unique way of integrating the map feature is through heatmaps. With heatmaps, you can display proper distribution of data about things such as crime rates in the neighborhood, traffic flow in the locality, population density around the property, etc. To integrate the heatmap feature,  you’d need to consult Google maps documentation for information on heatmap utility for android apps, and for </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iPhone app development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you need to consult the displaying overlays on a map in the iOS developer library. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. Property Details</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is property details. Of course, the users need to know all the details about the property before expressing any kind of interest in it. In the real estate app Zillow or Trulia, you will see houses needs to have the below-mentioned details listed to attract the interest of the buyers-</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How old the house is?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the condition of the house?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the offering price is?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the house</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long the owners have lived there.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many times the property has changed hands in the past.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brief history of the property.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the property details section, no buyer will show any interest in the property, so make sure that the details section is clear and detailed. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">F. Reviews &amp; Ratings</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ratings and reviews are other important features that your app needs. With this feature, the users will be able to leave their reviews on the property after viewing, about the agents on the platform and help the other users to understand the quality of service they can get from the app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">G. Image Gallery</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pictures are worth a thousand words, and even though there is a long and detailed description of the property, the buyers want to look at pictures. With the image gallery feature, sellers and agents can upload detailed images of the property to attract even more clients. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">H. Social Sharing </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With most people on social media platforms today, it is necessary that your app includes a social sharing feature as well. Because through social sharing, the sellers and agents can share a property listing on the social media platforms and get more interested buyers. </span></p>
<h2 id="How_should_be-the_UI/UX"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4th Brick: Interior Decoration for the App: the UI/UX Design</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decorating the interior of a house is important, so is the UI/UX for real estate mobile app design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the UI UX of a real estate app that is going to keep the users engaged in your app. They would move on from the app if they don’t like the design and user experience. So how are you going to make sure that the design and experience of your app stay up to the mark? Here are eight tips to design an amazing UI/UX for your app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Use Clear Images And Videos</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of clear images and videos is going to form the visual aspect of the entire app. The users definitely want to see the images before they decide if they want to go and visit the property or not. To create your own real estate app, you need to use high definition images is going to improve UI aesthetics as well. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Don’t Use Just Maps, Use Heatmaps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The map feature is a must, but there’s another way to improve it and that is through heatmaps. With the distribution of colors, heatmaps display various data such as population, crime rates, etc. The implementation of this feature is not only going to elevate the user experience but it is also going to make your app look great. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11443 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-image-gallery.png" alt="real estate mobile app features " width="1650" height="1276" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-image-gallery.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-image-gallery-300x232.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-image-gallery-768x594.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-image-gallery-1024x792.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Easy To Understand Menus</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid using too complicated terms and words for menus. Buying and selling a property is a complicated task already, and adding complicated terms is going to add more pressure on the first time user. The use of easy-to-understand terms for menus will help the users feel more comfortable with your app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Easy Navigation Pattern</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The navigation flow of your app needs to be easy to understand, almost intuitive. The users shouldn’t have to scramble through your app to find what they are looking for. So make sure that the transition from one point to another on the real estate app is easy and smooth. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. 3d Walkthrough And Floor Plans</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An added bonus to the image feature, 3D walkthrough, and floor plans would help the buyers to get an actual understanding of the floor plan, how the house looks from the inside and whether it matches their requirements or not. It will help them to make a decision on if they want to check out the property in real life or not. </span></p>
<h2 id="What_should_be_the_tech_stack?"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5th Brick: The Tech Stack That Makes the Apps</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After deciding all the features and functionalities, you need to decide on the proper tech stack to implement all those interesting features on your app. Here are a few tech stacks used by apps such as Zillow mobile and Trulia to get you started in planning the tech stack for your tech stack to create real estate sites like Zillow.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audience for property apps are quite extensive, including all kinds of people. So it’s important to go with a multi-platform approach, in which care, you will need Java to develop real estate applications for android and Swift for the iOS version. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Database: you can use Postgress, PostGIS SQL to integrate the databases on the system. You can also use APIs such as SimplyRETS, iHomeFinder, etc. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For social network sharing, you will need the Facebook SDK. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can create an interactive and customizable map with the help of Mapkit. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push notification feature: Firebase SDK and Apple Push Notification. </span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Monetization_Strategy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6th Brick: How to Make Money With the Apps?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re going to spend a lot of money to create a real estate app. Get an <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown/">estimation of how much does it cost to build an app</a> now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tried and tested, this monetization model has been around for a long enough time. And surely with relevant advertisements, you can generate revenue easily. However, make sure that the ads displayed are relevant to real estate, such as bank loans, mortgages, home renovation, etc. Every time any user taps on the ads you will earn a small revenue. If you want to create your own real estate app, this is your way to earn more money.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/proven-mobile-app-monetization-strategy/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11400 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/app-monetization-strategies.png" alt="app monetization ideas" width="981" height="227" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/app-monetization-strategies.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/app-monetization-strategies-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/app-monetization-strategies-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Various Fees</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can implement various fees on your application, such as listing fee when a user wants to get their property listed, extra fee from the agents on the platform to boost their profile to help them to get more clients etc. however, once again you should practice caution because having too pay too many fees will eventually annoy the users. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Premium Subscription</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, the premium subscription will enable the users to use the app to its full extent.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emergence of IoT came with the promise of endless possibilities, and smart homes are one of them. The ability to control different aspects of our homes remotely has made our lives easier to live. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multifaceted use of smart home apps and system are helping us to advance our lifestyle by leaps and bounds every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this article, we are going to talk about smart home systems, what they are, how the market scope looks like and ultimately, how we approach smart home app development. So without further ado, let’s get started.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Home App Development: How to Develop One?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a smart home system is different than developing a normal smartphone app. Here are the steps involved:</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lets&#8217;s talk about these in detail.</span></p>
<h2 id="Learning_how_smart_home_automation_works"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Smart Home Automation: What It Is And How It Works</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theory of smart home technology has been around for a long while, though the practical concept has been in practice since early 2000. During this time smart home devices became more affordable thanks to the emerging technology. Due to affordability, wide adaptation became possible, paving the way for better enhancement in the technology.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first-ever fully automated smart home was created by Emin Mathias in Jackson, Michigan in the USA. his home came to be known as the Push Button Manor. At this house, everything from the curtains to the dressing table lights was controlled by remotes. It was the only home in 1950 that reached a complete state of automation. Sadly though, Mathias never put his system up for sale in the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only mention-worthy attempt among them is the Microsoft home in 1990. It might not have been perfect, but with a home barcode scanner, and a time-shift TV, it came close to the development of smart homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how is the market doing now? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it worth developing smart home automation app? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at the market before we get to talking about smart home system development. </span></p>
<h2 id="Your_idea_validation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. The Expected Growth &#8211; Is Your Smart Home App Development Idea Valid?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increasing affordability and availability have helped the smart home market to grow exponentially. But how much has this market grown? And what is the expected growth for smart home technology?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the below chart, all smart home market segment except for video entertainment is going to see a double increase in worldwide shipment during 2018. It goes without saying that such growth means that the technology is only going to get more advanced.  And hence, startups are looking for <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/">iOS app development company</a> or someone who specializes in both Android and iOS to create smart home apps.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11120" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11120" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11120 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-growth.jpg" alt="growth of smart home app development" width="960" height="684" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-growth.jpg 960w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-growth-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-growth-768x547.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11120" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Statista</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is estimated that by the year 2022 the consumer spending on smart home devices is going to amount to $62.5 billion in North America alone. Currently, in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan is leading the smart home market thanks to its technologically advanced infrastructure. Europe is not far behind, with the popularity of smart home technology in UK growing to be 23.9% in the first quarter of 2019. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11121" style="width: 695px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11121 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-consumer-spends.png" alt="smart home app popularity area wise" width="695" height="442" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-consumer-spends.png 695w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-consumer-spends-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11121" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Statista</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology advances throughout the years, it is going to become more beneficial to invest in it. And that’s why knowing about smart home development can help you a lot more than you think. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what does it take to develop a smart home system? Let’s start the discussion.</span></p>
<h2 id="Choose_the_type_of_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Two Types Of Smart Home App That You Can Go For</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, for the successful smart home app development, you need to develop a smart home dashboard app which will enable the users to control their home automation system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are choosing android home automation app development or iOS smart home app development, When it comes to smart home apps, there are two kinds &#8211; single-tasking, and multitasking. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Single-tasking Smart Home App </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single-tasking smart home app is designed to control only one IoT device for smart home automation. With these apps, users can control only one smart home device. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11199" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11199 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/single-tasking-smart-home-app.png" alt="smart home app screen for single tasking" width="1650" height="1076" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/single-tasking-smart-home-app.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/single-tasking-smart-home-app-300x196.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/single-tasking-smart-home-app-768x501.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/single-tasking-smart-home-app-1024x668.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11199" class="wp-caption-text">Home Automation App Design by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is one problem with this solution- the users are not going to install more than one smart home devices at their home, creating a complex IoT environment. A single-tasking app would be able to control only one of the IoT devices. This means the users would have to install multiple apps, making things more complicated for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, there is one advantage, that is- developing a single-tasking app is easier than developing a multitasking app. It takes less time and resources, giving you a quick solution for your smart home system development.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Multitasking  Smart Home App</span><b> </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multitasking or universal smart home apps work with multiple smart home devices. Users can handle many smart devices simultaneously without any problems. Multitasking smart home apps offer perfect ease and efficiency to the users making them more popular. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11200" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11200 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/multi-tasking-smart-home-app.png" alt="smart home app development for multi tasking" width="1650" height="1076" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/multi-tasking-smart-home-app.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/multi-tasking-smart-home-app-300x196.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/multi-tasking-smart-home-app-768x501.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/multi-tasking-smart-home-app-1024x668.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11200" class="wp-caption-text">Multi-tasking Smart Home App visualization by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this approach needs more time, patience and resources to come to fruition. Want to check out the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/top-smart-home-apps/" target="_blank">top smart home app for 2020 in both the category</a>? </span></p>
<h2 id="Decide_the_core_features"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Let’s Talk About Core Features That You Can&#8217;t-Miss</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of these features can be a bit common, most are unique to smart home apps. Without these core features in your home automation app development, you can’t make your app work seamlessly with all your smart home devices. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Easy User Registration</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ordinary app, you will be encouraged to give the users a chance to log in and sign up using social media sites like Facebook or Google account. But in the case of a smart home IoT app, you need to make sure that the data security of the user is not compromised at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why when integrating the feature of user registration in your smart home system app, do not include social media sign up feature. Make sure that the customer creates their own unique username and password to sign up for the system. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Creating A User Profile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the user has logged in, they need to be able to create their own profile. With this profile, they would be able to control all the systems, as well as be able to create specific schedules for home automation. Make the smart home interface seamless.<br />
</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Access Configuration</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After creating a profile comes access configuration. This feature will help the users to create two kinds of profile for the home automation system &#8211; the admin profile with unlimited access to the device network and devices all around the house. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11202 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-for-smart-watch.png" alt="smart home watch app with loaded features" width="1650" height="1076" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-for-smart-watch.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-for-smart-watch-300x196.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-for-smart-watch-768x501.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-for-smart-watch-1024x668.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there is a limited user profile with limited access to all the features of the home automation system. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Onboarding Process</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT apps can be a little complicated to handle. And that’s why you should add the feature of the on-boarding process. With this feature, users can learn their way through the app easily. Remember to keep the directions easy and quick, because the users want to get on with the app as soon as possible. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Device &amp; Sensor Page</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the users have set up their profiles, they need to access the device &amp; sensor page to start controlling the smart devices around their house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be a page with a list of all the devices and sensors that are ready to be used. Through this page, the user would be able to turn smart home devices on and off along with controlling their settings as well. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">f. Room Selection</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature enables users to select one specific room, like smart home bedroom technology or for the smart home living room. And all the devices in that room to control it. This way rather than having to control specific devices one by one, they can easily control the smart home set up of one room simultaneously. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">g. Push Notification</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push notification is not a mere feature for smart home applications, it is a must-have. This feature will enable users to know all about the happenings with their smart home systems. Notifications about any changes in temperature or device settings would be sent to the users, and they can take actions based on it. This feature is going to help the user control every aspect of their home life with smart home automation. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">h. Groups And Scenes Creation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider this example &#8211; the user can create a scene for the morning. And when they wake up in the morning, they turn on the scene with a voice command, and the curtains open, lights turn off and the coffee maker starts to make coffee. This way they can make the most of home automation technology. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11205" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-to-make-an-app.png" alt="How to make an app" width="981" height="227" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-to-make-an-app.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-to-make-an-app-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-to-make-an-app-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the groups and scenes feature, the user would be able to group together certain devices, so that they can be controlled together. The user can also create different scenes specific to the time of the day. </span></p>
<h2 id="Understand_the_security_implementation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Should You Care About Security Implementation?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an ongoing joke about IoT security. And that is-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S in IoT stands for security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truly, the industry of IoT does lack security, and this can be especially dangerous for smart home devices. There are just too many unique threats a smart home system faces.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11125" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11125 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Iot-smart-home-scene.jpg" alt="results of smart home app development" width="740" height="651" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Iot-smart-home-scene.jpg 740w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Iot-smart-home-scene-300x264.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11125" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Joyoftech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to avoid being the butt of the security joke in the smart home IoT system, then you have to think about implementing security. And when you are thinking about integrating security, you need to follow the below directives-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Authenticate All Services And Endpoints</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any person or the device must be authenticated by the admin before being able to interact with the smart home network. This way you can prevent hackers with malicious intents from hacking into the network and taking control of the system. In case you are wondering how to make android app for home automation, you just cannot miss this feature.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Encrypt All Transmission Data</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart home IoT deals with a lot of data and this data need to be protected. And that’s why you need to make sure that the data collected and transmitted by your smart home system is being encrypted. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11201" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11201" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11201 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-dashboard.png" alt="smart home app development and its dashboard" width="1650" height="1076" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-dashboard.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-dashboard-300x196.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-dashboard-768x501.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-dashboard-1024x668.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11201" class="wp-caption-text">IoT Smart Home Application Dashboard by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, the plaintext data would be vulnerable and would be open to hackers with malicious intent. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Continuous Updates For The Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing updates for smart home devices are hard since there is no way for the users to update the devices manually. And that’s why you need to create an over the air automatic update system, through which the devices will be updated automatically. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Update Open Source IoT Libraries</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using open source IoT libraries for smart home app development, then you must know they are susceptible to vulnerabilities. And that’s why you need to create a plan for the open-source library updates and continue it. Keep an eye on any published vulnerabilities in the open-source elements you might have used and keep on publishing security updates for any security issues. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Integrate Security From The Beginning</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When building a smart home system, security has to be integrated from the beginning. It can not be a secondary choice. As a developer, you must understand the security concerns of the user and the various threats they are facing to implement the solutions to those problems in the system from the beginning. </span></p>
<h2 id="Choose_the_right_data_storage_type"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. What Should be Your Data Storage Type? Cloud or local</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A home automation system functions by collecting and processing data. Your smart home system needs to store this data somewhere, and for that, you have two options. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Cloud storage </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">with cloud storage, the data are stored in a cloud storage system, which can be accessed from anywhere anytime if the user has an internet connection. Another advantage of this system would be the ability to recover data even in the case of hardware/software failure. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Local storage </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">in this case, the collected data is going to be stored on an FTP server or built-in memory storage. While this might seem like the safer alternative for data storage, it will also increase power and battery consumption, eventually compromising your device&#8217;s health. </span></p>
<h2 id="The_smart_home_components_to_know_about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. What Are The Smart Home Components That You Should Know About?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is being called a smart home system, there are bound to be multiple components to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To function seamlessly, smart home systems need a number of devices, all connected to each other through the home IoT network. These devices can be classified into three categories.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. The Central Hub </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central hub is the main device, the brain of the entire system. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11137" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11137" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11137 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google-smart-home-central-hub.jpg" alt="Google smart home central hub" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google-smart-home-central-hub.jpg 1200w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google-smart-home-central-hub-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google-smart-home-central-hub-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google-smart-home-central-hub-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11137" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Alphr</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central hub is a device that works as a smart home control panel and creates a connection between the smart home app and the rest of the devices. Make sure the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/">mobile app development company in Casablanca</a> you choose is aware of it.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Sensors </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smart home sensors are necessary devices that receive intel about the external conditions, such as the state of humidity and temperature around the house, water leakage features, motion sensors, etc.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11138" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11138" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11138 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Smart-Sensors-by-Amazon-for-smart-home-app-development.jpg" alt="Smart Sensors by Amazon for smart home app development" width="600" height="374" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Smart-Sensors-by-Amazon-for-smart-home-app-development.jpg 600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Smart-Sensors-by-Amazon-for-smart-home-app-development-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11138" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Homestratosphere</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sensors are used to detect problems around the house that needs to be fixed. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Actuators </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actuators are the devices that are performing the actions you ask them to do. Such as the sprinkler system turning on when there is smoke, as well as the blinds closing themselves when you want them to close.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11139" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11139" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11139 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/philips-hue-for-smart-homes.jpg" alt="philips hue for smart homes" width="621" height="464" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/philips-hue-for-smart-homes.jpg 621w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/philips-hue-for-smart-homes-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11139" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Meethue</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three categories of devices together make up a smart home system. But how are they going to stay connected with each other and communicate? For that, they need a connectivity option, and you can choose one from several of them.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Wifi</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is probably the best and most popular way of connecting the smart home devices to the gateway. Most devices today come with wifi compatibility, although it might burn too much battery and energy to run the devices on wifi all the time. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Z-Wave </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by <a href="http://www.zen-sys.com/" target="_blank">Zensys</a>, Z-Wave is a mesh network that helps the home automation devices to connect to each other. With Z-wave, devices use low-energy radio energy, which ultimately saves battery and energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Z-Wave, users get a large open-air operating range of 90 meters outdoors, and the operating range of more than 24 meters indoors. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">f. Bluetooth</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standard technology for exchanging data with a fixed mobile device, Bluetooth can be considered as one of the connectivity solutions for smart home IoT. with Bluetooth, users can easily control smart home devices from their smartphones and tablets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Bluetooth, users can save batter and energy because it is a low battery consuming connectivity technology. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">g. Zigbee </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee" target="_blank">Zigbee</a> is one of the most convenient wireless protocols used for smart home automation. Most of the recent smart home devices are compatible with this connectivity protocol. However, Zigbee works at a 2.4GHz frequency, which is similar to WiFi and Bluetooth. Which is why there can be network interferences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have discussed the smart home system components and connectivity options, it’s time to come down to the real issue at hand- how to develop a smart home system. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding love has been an eternal quest for us human beings. With so many books, movies, and stories all revolving around finding The One, it’s not a wonder that even today we are in one way or another fixated on finding our one true love.</span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we are living in 2019. It seems everything can be solved if you know <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/" target="_blank">how to make an app</a>! Ain&#8217;t it? </span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately for the hopeless romantics, today we have a better chance of finding love, thanks to applications like Tinder. By assessing how to create a dating app, startups are making it easy and simple to find the right match anytime anywhere. </span>To make it easy for your business idea as well, this article focuses on how to make a dating app.</p>



<h2 style="text-align: left;">So, How to Create a Dating App?</h2>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s talk about the steps now&#8230; </span></p>



<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. Competition Study &#8211; Analyze your Rivals</h2>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market is flooded with dating apps and you want your application to be the best of them. Which is why it’s important for you to study your competition well. </span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a thorough study of your competition, you’d be able to understand what is the reason for their success or failure. You can use that understanding in your own venture and build an app like Tinder successfully.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a close look at their features, and figure out what they are doing differently. They are all more or less the same, with minor differences. And these minor differences are what sets them apart. With this study of their unique features, you’ll make sure that you don’t end up accidentally repeating any on your platform. So how to make an online dating app? First, validate your idea.</span></p>



<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Validate Your Idea to Create a Dating App &#8211; Is It Worth It?</span></h2>



<p style="text-align: left;">Even when <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/310335/us-online-dating-app-site-usage-gender/" target="_blank">60% male and 70% female population of the US</a> admit that they have never tried online dating, the rising popularity tells a different tale. In the US alone, <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/372/100/online-dating/worldwide" target="_blank">the revenue churned out by these apps is near about $1667 million</a>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_10245" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10245" style="width: 1133px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10245 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rise-in-dating-apps.jpg" alt="rise in dating app development" width="1133" height="522" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10245" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Statista</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what is the reason for this amount of popularity?</span> What makes these apps so lovable to the users? Does the market still have takers? There are some solid reasons for that!</p>



<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Desire To Connect Meets Desire To Simplify</span></h3>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As human beings, we are supposed to want to meet and connect with other human beings. </span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s how we got dating apps. </span></p>





<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Internet Popularity</span></h3>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously there may have been a stigma about looking for people to date online. People thought only losers signed up on such platforms.</span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From paying bills to ordering groceries, everything is online now. So it is obvious that even dating is going to become online. </span></p>





<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Tailor-Made For Your Preferences</span></h3>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not easy to find a ‘</span><b>tall blonde partner with brown eyes who is an astronomy enthusiast</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ and also speaks five languages.</span></p>





<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps and websites like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jdate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Mingle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have made it easy for people to find matches based on their religion. </span></p>



<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Less Intimacy, Easy To Find</span></h3>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People don’t have time to sit down and write long romantic love letters, or sit down and chat to find out more about one another. Even if they do, and it doesn’t work out, it’ll be a waste of time and energy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>







<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. Know the Matching Algorithm to Make a Dating App</h2>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the dating app builder believe that at the end of the day it’s the algorithm voodoo that brings people together. But that’s not the case all the time. </span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.eharmony.com/online-dating-statistics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 64% of people said that they look for people based on common interest, and 49% of people said they look for people who they find attractive. So at the end of the day, there is not much math involved in here. </span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-9298 size-full" style="text-align: left;">
<figure class="aligncenter">
<figure id="attachment_10093" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10093" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10093" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Location-matching-with-profile-in-dating-app.gif" alt="Location matching with profile in dating app" width="825" height="780" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10093" class="wp-caption-text">How we created the location matching with profiles</figcaption></figure>
</figure>
</div>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dating app developers today are experimenting with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence and dating apps</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With the application of AI in such apps, things are bound to change in the online matchmaking market scenario in the next twenty years. </span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when you are thinking about how to develop a dating app like Tinder consider how you are going to match people with each other. You need to create your application to caters to the user&#8217;s preferences. This can easily be done with the help of a simple questionnaire at the beginning of the signup process. </span></p>



<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. ‘Locating’ The Perfect Person</span></h4>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s all in the location. It is always easier for your user to be matched and go on dates with someone close to them. So you can apply a GPS based location system if you want to build a dating app to find potential matches for the user. </span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way they can easily find a list of all the people who can be the potential match, and all of these people on the list will be from the same city.</span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add a special monetization feature with this, where the users will pay to expand their search and match radius. This is not only going to increase their chances of romance but generates revenue for you as well. </span></p>



<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Understand the Math Of Love to Create a Dating App</span></h4>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can implement a math-based system to match the users with each other. It is based on the questionnaire, which the users need to fill up when they sign up for the service. Once they have filled out the forms, it’s time for math to do its magic. To know how to make a mobile dating app, understand the math of love.</span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This technique is used to assess the compatibility level of two users based on the answers they have given to the questions. When the compatibility level is higher than a certain number, they are matched with each other. </span></p>



<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Match According To Behaviour</span></h4>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sad thing about any kind of online platform is that people tend to lie about many things. Which is why you should go with the behavior-based matching technique. This is basically a Big-Data based approach to match the users on a dating app.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_10094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10094" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10094" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Find-matches-nearby.gif" alt="how to build a dating app" width="825" height="780" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10094" class="wp-caption-text">Finding people nearby in dating app by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a bit more complicated than location-based or simple question-answer based solution, but it is more accurate. With this, you are going to analyze the data of the users collected from different sources such as social media accounts, groups they are part of, their profile, etc. </span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this approach, there will be less catfishing on your platform. </span></p>



<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Bonus: Advanced Techniques For Making A Match</span></h4>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with our watches and phones, dating apps too are getting smarter. </span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With advanced techniques like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, VR and AR are revolutionizing the online match finding scene. This way you can provide more accurate matches for the users. The popular machine learning technology used in Netflix is being used in dating applications today. </span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of matching techniques you can add to your app. Whichever you choose to go with, make sure that the matches made between the users are good. Otherwise, people will use your platform less and less. </span></p>



<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. Keep the Security Top-notch While Making Your Dating App</h2>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all its good uses, online dating also comes with its downsides. Without proper security, such online platforms can easily become the playground for creeps and frauds. So if you want to know </span>how to make a dating app for Android<span style="font-weight: 400;"> or iOS, you need to make sure that your app is safe for people to use.</span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to follow </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/mobile-app-security-checklist/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a thorough app security checklist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure the security of your users.  Use a profile verification method to verify the profile of those who are joining the platform. With the help of social media and phone number verification, you can make sure that the people who are joining your app are legit and are not pretending to be someone else. It will also help in improving the user experience of your app as they can trust it easily.</span></p>

</div>



<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://bumble.com/the-buzz/the-end-of-catfishing-introducing-photo-verification" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dating app Bumble has gone another step ahead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and added photo verification to their app. With this, the user needs to upload a selfie in a specific pose, like flashing a peace sign on the app to get verified. And that is how Bumble has stopped catfishing on their app.</span></p>



<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: left;">5. Important Features To Implement in Your Dating App</h2>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make a dating platform like Tinder, you need to incorporate some features in your application. So what are these basic yet important features? </span></p>



<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. A Thorough Verification System</span></h3>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is without a question the most important one. Without a thorough verification system, your platform is going to become a wonderland for creeps and frauds. So adding a good and secure verification system is important to secure the experience of your users.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_10247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10247" style="width: 1390px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10247 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/photo-verification.jpg" alt="make a dating app like Badoo with best security" width="1390" height="781" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/photo-verification.jpg 1390w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/photo-verification-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/photo-verification-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/photo-verification-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1390px) 100vw, 1390px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10247" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TechCrunch</figcaption></figure>





<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add a social media verification system to make sure the person is who they are saying they are. You can also add a phone number verification system and a photo verification system. In brief, you have to implement a strong and secure verification system for the safety of your users. This will answer your question about how to make a great dating app profile that is secured.<br /></span></p>



<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Matching With Your Objective</span></h3>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users should have an option to express their objective o their profile. An online dating app user can have many reasons for using the service. It can be for a long term relationship or a quick and casual affair. Whatever it is, they should have an option to state that on their profile.</span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with that, they should also get matches with similar objectives. It’s no use for someone who is looking for a serious relationship to be matched with those who are looking for a casual hook up. </span></p>



<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. In-app Messaging </span></h3>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no point in having a dating app and not having a messaging feature. With this feature, users can connect with each other and talk to each other, planning dates and meetings. This will help them not only in getting closer but also in understanding whether this match is worth investing their time on or not. </span></p>



<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Giving You The Perfect First Date Idea</span></h3>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a fun feature for you to add to your app. Most of the time people are stumbling with the perfect first date idea. They don’t know whether they should go for a formal dinner or a casual coffee.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_10095" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10095" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10095 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Profile-matching-algorithm.gif" alt="create a dating app" width="825" height="780" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10095" class="wp-caption-text">Profile creating by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this feature, you can make sure that they have the perfect first date. By giving them quirky and fun first date ideas that they would remember forever, you will make sure your dating application becomes the apple of their eye. </span></p>



<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Undoing The Mistaken Swipe Or Like</span></h3>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times we have mistakenly swiped right when really, we wanted to swipe left. </span></p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give people a chance to undo their mistake when you are planning on how to create your own dating platform. They might have accidentally tapped on like for someone’s profile when they didn’t want to. Give them a small window of opportunity to undo their choices. This will increase their chances of ending up with someone they actually like. </span></p>



<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">f. See The Preference &#8211; Do They Like The Same Thing As You?</span></h3>



<p style="text-align: left;">For a lot of people, not liking the same movie or tv series is a deal-breaker.</p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it makes sense if they can see the basic preferences for their matches on your application. Let them dedicate a small portion of their profile to their favorite music, shows, and tv series. This is going to help them create that perfect ice-breaking conversation.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">g. Push Notification</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Got new matches? Show it on your push notification feature! Though it might annoy sometimes, if done right, it can actually increase the app usage and engagement. The trick is to keep the notifications relevant and less frequent. Try out this feature as you go deeper into the development.</p>



<h2 id="id_6" style="text-align: left;">6. Ready To Build An Amazing Dating Experience? Wait. What Is The Tech Stack?</h2>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making a dating application comes with its own responsibilities, like knowing the technology stack.

<h2 id="id_7" style="text-align: left;">7. Cost Of Creating A Dating App</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a brief rundown of all the steps of developing an app.</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find plenty of answers to all these questions online, but they are all in a very fragmental and scattered style. Here we are going to give you answers to all the questions you may have about how to create an app in a comprehensive manner.</span></p>
<h2 id="Go_through_a_proper_idea_validation_process"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Why Should You Build An App?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you want to create an app?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a simple answer for this, “because I have an idea for an app.” But is that answer good enough?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting, you need to know that just because your idea sounds good theoretically, does not mean it is going to be awesome. It needs to have a value proposition for its users.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So before you really get into it, look at the idea and then look at it again. Analyze the idea and find out why this project is really needed out there. What problem is it going to solve? How is it going to help the people out there</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also need to look at the logistics side of the idea. How is the idea going to be translated into the application? How will it make you money? Only after you’ve done a complete evaluation of your idea should you go ahead with your idea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t just listen to those who say “wow, the idea is great, you should make an app for that!!” do your own research first. See if your app is absolutely needed out there. Because if it isn’t you are only going to waste your money by investing in it.  </span></p>
<h2 id="Understanding_your_Target_Audience"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Who Is Your Target Audience? Have You Made A List?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every answer related to how to build an app online has the topic of target audience related to it. So who is the target audience?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who are going to use your app?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding your target audience before you start building your app is one of the most important steps. This will help you understand what features you need in your app. It will also help you to choose a platform? Based on that you can ask the following questions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make an app for iPhone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Or, how to make an app for Android?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you are building an e-commerce app for a makeup company, your target audience is going to be mostly women. Knowing this, it will be easier for you to optimize your app according to their need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the target audience is also important for figuring out what kind of monetization model you need to choose. Knowing your target audience means also knowing how they are going to pay and how you can generate revenue from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In brief, knowing your target audience means knowing how to build an app that everyone loves.</span></p>
<h2 id="Research_your_market_competition"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Why Do You Need To Research Your Competition?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today no idea is unique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when you are thinking “I have an idea for an app”, someone somewhere is probably developing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how to make your app unique?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer to the question, how to build an app that is unique is easy- you look into the competition in the market. See what they are doing, if you have to, use their app for a while. Do a complete and thorough analysis of what they are doing and how they are doing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then think of how you can do it differently and more efficiently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users out there don’t need two same apps. So in order to really sell your app, you need to make it as unique as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to understand the pain points of the user, and analyze how your competition is solving that problem. And then figure out how you can solve that same problem in a better and unique way.</span></p>
<h2 id="Understanding_the_cost_structure_of_your_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. What Is Cost Structure And Why Should You Know About It?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing in this world is free, and the same thing is true for your app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So just as you are thinking “I have an idea for an app.” you also need to think, “how much is it going to cost to build the app?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an app takes money. Whether you are going to hire the services of an experienced app development company, or doing it yourself with some of your buddies. The question you are probably asking is </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how much is it going to cost to make your own app?</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That depends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a vague answer, but it is true. The cost of building your app depends on your idea. Below are the three factors on which the cost of building your app depends. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Functionality and Complexity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more complex your app is, the more money it will take to build.</span></p>
<p>Something<span style="font-weight: 400;"> simple- like a to-do list app is going to cost less than a complex gaming app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your idea may be simple, but you may also want your app to be full of simple little features. This will increase the cost of development. Even though today app developers are more efficient in delivering the project with a wide range of convenient features. It is still a better idea for you to go with MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for that first version of the app. You can add more features as you go on. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Device and Platform</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technical aspect of what kind of app you are building is going to affect the costing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, you have to decide whether you want a native app, which will be installed directly into an Android or an iOS device. Or you can choose to build a hybrid app, which runs directly on a device’s browser, regardless of the operating system.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9033 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-1-1.jpg" alt="how to make an app - the cost" width="981" height="242" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-1-1.jpg 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-1-1-300x74.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-1-1-768x189.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you decide, is going to play a major role in determining the development cost. App development for different platforms like Android and iOS takes a different amount of money. So choosing the device is important if you want to determine your app-building cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, you may want your app to be suitable for more than one platform. Building an app simultaneously for more than one platform is going to raise the cost of app building.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Deadline to Build An App</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When do you want the app?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timeline or the deadline is going to be important in determining the cost of the app.  You may want the app in a few weeks or a few months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how is the timeline relevant to the app building cost?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The longer it takes in app building, the more money it will cost you. Which means that you should have the app built as soon as possible right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you rush through the development process, it is actually going to cost you more money in the long term. So how long should it really take?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to find a sweet spot between the timeline. Taking too long or too short a time is going to raise the cost of the app. If you rush the developer team, then not only will your app quality suffer, but you’ll also have to pay the team rush charges to deliver the project in a short amount of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So make sure to set a reasonable timeline for your app to be developed if you want to keep the cost reasonable.</span></p>
<h2 id="Going_for_a_business_model_to_make_the_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Do You Need A Business Model? Which One to Go For?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the business model? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are building an app startup, you need to implement a business model. This will help you to make money. But how are you going to make money with your business model?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of business models you can apply to monetize your apps. Some of the most popular ones are</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freemium</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the most popular business models when it comes to monetizing your apps. With freemium, you are offering the user a limited version of your app. If they want full access, they would have to pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is better than putting a price on your app from the get-go, because then people may not even give your app a chance. With the Freemium model, users can at least check out your app before deciding whether they want to keep using it or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways you can make money with this technique, firstly through a subscription basis. And secondly, through a one-time payment basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With one-time payment basis, your users are going to pay once to get access to all the exclusive content on your app. And with monthly subscription technique is going to earn you a steady stream of revenue through monthly payments. </span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9035" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9035" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/monetization-methods-1.png" alt="how to make an app that makes money" width="635" height="317" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9035" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://sweetpricing.com/blog/2017/01/freemium-mobile-apps/</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-app Purchases</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With in-app purchases, you can give your users a chance to buy virtual goods. This model is widely used by various gaming apps, but apps such as </span><a href="https://radishfiction.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radish fiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also implemented this technique. You can buy virtual coins on Radish fiction with which you can unlock new chapters of books. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the simplest ways of monetizing your idea, paid apps are very popular among app owners. By charging the users one time when they are downloading and installing the app, you can earn revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to get significant revenue this way, you have to have a wide base of the user, which can be a little problematic for the startups.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/top-app-monetization-ideas/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9046" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-15-1.png" alt="how to build an app and earn money" width="981" height="227" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-15-1.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-15-1-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-15-1-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<h2 id="Fixing_the_app_features_and_the_wireframes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. What App Feature Do You Really Need? Are You Feeling Overwhelmed?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After looking at solutions for how to build an app, make a list of the features you want your app to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before you even think about how to develop your own app with the maximum feature on the first version, STOP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t try to aim for as many features as possible on the very first version. It is very unrealistic of you to want your app to have tons of feature on the first launch. Try to send out an MVP with essential features that are going to help you in getting more users and revenues. These features can be &#8211;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push notifications</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most efficient ways of building a connection with your users, push notifications are necessary for your app. Whether you have a reminder app or an e-commerce app, push notifications can reach out to your users, telling them about new features, updates, exclusive deals, etc. Push notifications can be used very efficiently to generate more revenues from users.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real-time sync</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a website, and an app based on it, it is necessary you have real-time sync on your app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature of auto syncing is going to sync all the user information over all platforms. Specifically important in e-commerce apps, the real-time sync feature makes sure that users have a similar experience throughout all the platforms. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security updates</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are going to be security problems with your apps whether you like it or not. Even the most famous social media </span><a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2018/10/facebook-notified-30-million-users-information-hack.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook has gone through security breaches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So it is quite possible that your app might go through that as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is the reason why you absolutely have to have the feature of a security update from day one of app launch. Your app is obviously going to collect some user data to work. You need to make sure that these user data are safe and not used by anyone with malicious intent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making your app a safe place for your users are going to get your app more followers and users. </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/mobile-app-security-checklist/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So figure out all the ways you can make your app secure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2 id="Choosing_the_right_app_development_partner">7. Choosing The Right Team To Build Your App</h2>
<p>Now that you have the features picked out for your app, you need to pick the right team to build your app.</p>
<p>If your company is a global multinational company then you probably have your own in-house development team. But if you are just a small startup, you have a choice to make.</p>
<p>You can hire freelancers who would develop your app at a lower price. When you hire freelancers, you have fewer people to communicate with and the process moves faster.</p>
<p>As for hiring an agency for the app building, it is a bit pricey, but the end result is going to be of good quality. App development agencies have more experience and more specialization. Along with that, when you hire an app development agency, they will work on several parts of the project simultaneously, like the wireframing and the pre-launch marketing strategy making can be done simultaneously, which means the project will go faster.</p>
<h2 id="Fixing_the_App_development_platform_to_build"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. What Platform Should You Choose?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, we are back to the point of platforms- Android vs iOS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you found out How to make your app for iPhone? Or do you need to find all about how to </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make an app for Android</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? To know the answer to this, you need to choose a platform first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently Android and iOS are dominating the global smartphone market. So which one should you choose and why does it matter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a developmental point of view, it is easier and less time consuming to develop an app for iOS when compared to Android. Android’s open source project means that multiple manufacturers can make their own optimization to the OS and use it for their own smartphone brands. </span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9039" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9039" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9039" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/android-vs-ios-app-development-1.jpg" alt="how to make an app android vs ios" width="640" height="400" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9039" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://comtech2.com/android-vs-ios-app-development-app-startups-focus-ios-first/</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why there is a vast number of different Android phones in the market. And to make an Android app means to make it compatible with all of them. So it is going to take a lot of time to build your Android app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">iOS is a closed system, owned and used by Apple on their own devices. So when you choose iOS as your platform, there is not really any worries about different devices and their compatibilities. Your app only needs to be compatible with Apple devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you are probably thinking which platform is going to make you the most money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Android dominates the global market, it is </span><b>iOS apps that make more money<span style="font-weight: 400;">. The vast number of apps available for an Android user means they are more prone to find a free app than pay for one. iOS users, on the other hand, have no problem spending money over a quality app.</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as for the user count, Android definitely has more users than iOS, but when it comes to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">smartphone user market in the US, and Europe, there are more iPhone users than Android users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, there is an entire matter of wireframing. The wireframing process comes hand in hand with the platform choice making. Whichever platform you choose, the wireframe needs to be developed according to that platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wireframing process is important for the later design and graphics process. It is the skeleton of your app and it needs to be built with care and precision. Choosing the platform will help you with that precision.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can choose to develop your app for both platforms. But initially, you need to choose one platform which suits your immediate needs the best.</span></p>
<h2 id="Designing_the_UI_UX_of_the_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Should You Give Enough Attention to The Design And Layout?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To know how to develop an app that is going to be a wide success, you need to pay attention to the design and layout of the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the thought “I have an idea for an app” makes it in your head, you should start thinking about how that app is going to look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design and layout are going to create the first impression on your users, and first impressions matter more than you think.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only thing you need to remember when it comes to the design and user interface is that it needs to be natural. There is no point in having an app with a hard to use interface. Your users are not going to spend time learning to use your app.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9038" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9038" style="width: 675px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9038" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dmv1-1.jpg" alt="how to make an app design" width="675" height="476" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9038" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://dribbble.com/unifiedinfotech</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that your user can find stuff and use your app easily. You have to keep it as simple as you can, without adding too much on the screen. The clutter can encourage users to get rid of your app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s age of less is more,  having a minimal design with a seamless experience is the way to get users to love your app. Don’t try to cram your app interface with icons and texts. Just keep it simple. </span></p>
<h2 id="Fixing_the_Device_adaptability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Should You Worry About Device Adaptability?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a large number of devices people can choose from these days. So device adaptability should be one of your top priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users are going to use more than one device to access your app. So by making your app adaptable for multiple devices is going to expand your user base. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a couple of factors when it comes to device adaptability of your app that you need to keep in mind. These are- </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">screen size and resolution,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">network bandwidth of different devices, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">connectivity issues, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage capacity </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">configuration details.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are trying to get your app suitable for a device, make sure to have a complete understanding of the functionality of the device before you start custom coding for it.</span></p>
<h2 id="The_size_of_your_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11. How Much Should The File Size Be? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one wants to download and install an app that is too big in size. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile phones may have become more improved over the ages, but they still don’t have as much space as a desktop computer. So making your app file size smaller is really going to pay off.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9043" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9043" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9043" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/average-mobile-app-file-size-1-1.png" alt="how to make an app and what should be the size" width="635" height="317" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9043" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://sweetpricing.com/blog/2017/02/average-app-file-size/</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cutting down the amount of data consumed and the file size without hampering the experience should be your number one priority. Giving the users an app that has fast performance and small size means they will enjoy using your app for a longer time.</span></p>
<h2 id="Need_for_app_localization"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12. Should You Localize Your App?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localization of your app means translating your app into multiple regional languages specific to different countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localization of your app is a great way of getting global recognition. But what comes before localization?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you translate your app and localize it, you need to internationalize it. Internationalization is a process through which you optimize the code of your app so that it can be used globally. After that, you can go ahead with the localization of your app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localization is going to give you a larger base of users from different countries. But does your app need localization?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no point in making an app available in a different language if it is only solving the US-based problem. Your app has to have a global appeal to achieve success through localization.</span></p>
<h2 id="Testing_testing_testing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13. What Is Even Beta Testing?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to make a mobile app that satisfies your users?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through beta testing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beta testing is having your final product tested by a group of experienced testers. Through beta testing, you can get an idea of how your app is working. You can also find out what other optimizations need to be done to make your app ready to be launched in the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is crucial that you test and then retest your app before releasing it. With the help of an experienced team of beta testers, you can get important feedback on your app. This feedback is going to help you make your app better and user ready.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a strong number of beta testers, you can choose services like </span><a href="https://betalist.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BetaList</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.betabound.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betabound</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and many more. These services are going to connect you with a strong team of public betas, giving you honest and useful feedback on your app. </span></p>
<h2 id="Launching_and_marketing_of_your_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">14. How Is Marketing Important For Your App?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because you are thinking “I have an idea for an app, and it is so unique that it doesn’t need marketing.” does not mean it really does not need marketing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing your app is going to be more important than you think it is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More often than not, app makers actually ignore the importance of marketing. Which is how they end up with a stellar app but make no profit out of it. A marketing strategy that suits the functionality and features of your app is incredibly important.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9325" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9325" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9325" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Graph-1_app-marketing-budget_pt.-2-1-1-1.png" alt="how to make and app and do its marketing" width="635" height="646" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9325" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://themanifest.com/app-development/why-marketing-critical-mobile-app-success</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may miss out on the marketing opportunity because you along with the development team are focusing all your energy and investment on the development of the app. Which is why you need to make a clear marketing strategy and stick to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marketing of your app needs to start from an early stage. You need to get your target audience hyped up about your app. They need to know about your app, and why they should install it so that as soon as your app is launched, you get instant users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/proven-mobile-app-monetization-strategy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make money with your amazing app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, marketing is also incredibly important. So don’t forget to plan a proper marketing strategy to make the most out of your app. </span></p>
<h2 id="Fixing_the_app_description"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15. Writing The Right Kind Of App Description</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the one thing anyone does before installing an app?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read the app description.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most of us, the decision of installing the app is made halfway through the app description on the app store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need a good app description to make people want to install your app. Google Play store and Apple app store both display only two-three lines of description before the read more option. You need to make sure that those initial lines get the potential user hooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how to write a good app description?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about the first time you thought “I have an idea for an app” what was your vision then? How did you convince yourself to start working on your idea? And start from there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your description simple but interesting, telling the user what exactly is the apps purpose and why they need it. Don’t add too many embellishments, and don’t provide details they don’t need.</span></p>
<h2 id="Maintenance_and_upkeep"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16. Final Maintenance And Upkeep Of The App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just launching the app is not enough, you need to maintain the app as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the app is launched, you need to make sure that the app still functions well. Along with that, you also need to roll out updates, fixing the problems and bugs the previous version had. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that you listen to user reviews as well. They might have their own suggestions about the app and its features. Listening to them and taking their advice is going to make sure that they stay loyal to your app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So even after you have launched the app, you need to keep paying attention to the maintenance and upkeep of the app. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few Last Words</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know all the answers to the basic questions related to how to build an app, it is time for you to start working on that app idea you had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before you start working on it, don’t forget to ask questions. It is your idea and your app. You have the right to know all the information you want to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an app and making a successful app are two different things. To make your app successful, you need to ask as many questions as you can about the app and its development, test the app, again and again, to make it perfect for launch, and then keep up with the quality of the app even after it has been launched. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right planning and strategy, your idea can also be the next breakthrough app. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9047" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-freelancer-vs-agency-2-1.png" alt="how to make an app freelancer vs agency" width="981" height="227" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-freelancer-vs-agency-2-1.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-freelancer-vs-agency-2-1-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-freelancer-vs-agency-2-1-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right planning and strategy, your idea can also be the next breakthrough app. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonus: Should You Patent Your App Idea?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever heard of patenting an app?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it is an actual thing and you too can patent your app,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how to Patent an App Idea? What are the things you need to know before running to the patent office?.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Eligibility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you are thinking “I have an idea for an app, and it is really unique.” but just because it is unique does not mean it can be patented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin the patenting process, the first thing The USPTO (US Patent &amp; Trademark Office) would recommend you to perform a patent search before filing for a patent. You need to search for any related keywords to your app, or idea and see if someone has already filed for that patent or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can&#8217;t just patent your ‘idea’. To patent app idea, you need to have a complete understanding of how your app is going to work. On the application, you’d have to give a complete description of what your app does and how it works. So if you just have a vague idea, then develop the idea a little before going for a patenting application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with being ‘novel’ your app idea also needs to work in a non-obvious or an unexpected way. This is where it gets a bit complicated. The basic idea is that people who are particularly skilled in your field need to consider your idea as extremely unique and unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last criteria are really easy- your app needs to work. It needs to solve a problem, or just simply work.  Which is why you need to know exactly how your app is working. Knowing this, you would be able to give a detailed description of how your app is useful to the people.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Filing Process</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing you need to do is to file for a provisional patent application to secure a filing date for your patent. This is cheaper than filing for a non-provisional patent application and needs little effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securing your filing date is important. It determines who was first-to-file in case of a legal problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to include visual elements in your application such as flow chart, drawings, and sketches of the app layout. This will help the patent officers decide whether your app is worth the patent or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-year timeline provided to you in the provisional application gives you time to see if your app idea is going to be successful or not. Once you file the final Patent application, the final patenting process will start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you are probably not going to get the patent on the first time. The process would probably take anywhere from 1-3 years. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is Patenting Your App Worth It?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So patenting your app sounds like a good idea, and you are probably going to see if your app is worth patenting or not. But at the end of the day, is patenting worth it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After knowing how to patent app idea, you need to know about why to or why not to patent it. Sure patenting your app means protecting your idea and making sure no one rips it off, making a profit at your expense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But patenting is not going to protect your idea from being copied. The code can be copyrighted, sure, but at the end of the day, no code is really unique. There are numerous code libraries available online. You can easily find codes for any feature on your app there. So there is really nothing unique about coding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most importantly, getting a patent for your app is a wild card. You already have to invest enough money to build your app and get it going. On top of that, investing money on the patent is going to cost you anywhere around $5000-$20000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are, once you got your app in the market, if it doesn’t do good enough business, you are going to shut it down. In that case, the money you spent will go down the drain.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/ben-lee/you-dont-need-a-patent-for-your-app-heres-why.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you don’t really need to patent your app. It takes too much effort and resources away from you, which you could use to build your app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So before you start the process of patenting your app, think about it carefully.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since you are here, you must have figured out <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">how to make an app</span></a>. And now you are looking to make money out of it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading all about <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/proven-mobile-app-monetization-strategy/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">app monetization strategies</span></a>, now you definitely want to know all about the working ways of monetizing your apps. There are many ways of doing just so, but before we tell you about that, you need to know something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though there are different app monetization ideas you can use to monetize your apps, you can’t blindly implement them. Just because one monetization technique earns more money than the other, it doesn&#8217;t mean it is going to work out for your app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s move onto explore the ways you can make money with your app with these proven app monetization ideas.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Various Ways For You to Monetize Your App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you know all about how to make your app worthy of monetization and which platform is best for making money with your app. Now we are going to talk about some app monetization ways.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/proven-mobile-app-monetization-strategy/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9016" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-monetization-strategies-2.png" alt="app monetization ideas" width="981" height="227" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-monetization-strategies-2.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-monetization-strategies-2-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-monetization-strategies-2-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get steady revenue streams for apps by using any of the following app revenue model, based on the compatibility with your app. Some of these mobile app monetization models have been here since the genesis of smartphone apps, some are relatively new, but they all have one thing in common- any of these can help you make money through your app. So let’s look at how to make money from the app.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Paid Apps / Premium Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the oldest of app monetization ways paid apps have been here from the beginning. It is the very first app monetization models used by app developers. By principle, ad monetization strategy is very simple. Whatever app you have, you can launch it on the app store, and put a price on it, meaning that when people try to install your app, they have to pay a price for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a surefire way of making money with your app. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the price is, you get to keep 70% of it while the app store takes 30%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But, this is also one of the oldest and backdated way of making money through the app. Let&#8217;s face it, even you don’t like paying for an app. If there is a similar app which is free, you’d probably opt for that instead for a paid app. And most of the people out there are like that. While some may pay for an app, most would rather install a free similar app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then again, if you are sure that your app is the best out there and it is worth paying for, then go ahead and put a price on it. Once everyone starts paying for your app, you’ll start to receive money for it straight away, making up for all the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown/" target="_blank">effort and cost you put into developing the app</a></span>.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Try The Freemium Before You Buy The Premium</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doesn’t the word Freemium sound fun and interesting? Well, the concept of freemium apps is one of the interesting ones among app monetization ideas. It is basically a free trial version of your app. The users are going to download this version, and if they are satisfied with the entire app, they might buy its premium version. This ensures freemium app revenue for your app idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freemium is by far the best app revenue model. It gives the users a taste of your app before you ask for them to pay for it. Most users are going to wonder whether your app is worth paying money for or not. With the freemium app, you can clear their doubts. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types Of Freemium Apps</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few options you can choose from if you choose Freemium to monetize your apps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trial version: A trial version of apps are a great way of giving the user experience of the app before you ask them to pay for the full version. Launching a trial version app, which they can use only for a limited time is a better app mobile app monetization strategy than asking them to pay for your app up front. You can get a better freemium app revenue if you can satisfy your users in the trial version.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special paid feature: You have probably noticed how on Spotify you need to buy the premium service before you can download the songs offline. This is another way you can make your apps freemium. Your users will pay for those special features, only if they are worth it. If you are wondering how to monetize Android apps, go for special paid fetaures.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free to play: This freemium model works best if you are thinking about monetizing a gaming app. You can offer the user a limited time of free to play, before asking them to buy the entire game. Once they are hooked, they are sure to pay for the rest of the game.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. In-app Purchase</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever got stuck on that one level of candy crush, with no lives left, but with this fierce urge to finish that level then and there? Yeah, we all have. Thankfully though, the game offers this sweet feature where we can pay a small price to get our lives back (the game lives of course.) and the implementation of this feature is called in-app purchase.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8981" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-lazy-man-guide-1.png" alt="how much does it cost to make an app cta" width="981" height="227" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-lazy-man-guide-1.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-lazy-man-guide-1-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-lazy-man-guide-1-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The premise is simple- you offer some features within your apps, which need to be paid for. If you have a gaming app and want to use in-app purchase in your app try the following ways-</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaming upgrades: to save time and level up easily, there are in-app upgrades on the apps. Gamers would pay you in order to level up their gaming characters, their farm, or even their in-game kitchen equipment. It’s all about leveling up.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumables: every game offers in-game consumables. It can be life, or food, or trendy clothes and gadgets to make your gaming character look cool. All this can be bought for money, and trust us when we say this- the die-hard players are going to pay for these consumables, all you have to do is to make sure they love your game.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game currency/virtual currency: ever had to stop upgrading your farm or city because you ran out of game cash? Yes, even that can be helped.  While developing your mobile game, put in-app-currency purchase, with which the players can keep on developing their in-game characters, or city, and never run out of game cash.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only for games, these days a lot of apps offer in-app virtual currency you can buy with cash. Later you can access special features with those in-app currencies. </span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_8999" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8999" style="width: 670px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-8999 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/most-used-monetization-methods-670x335-1.png" alt="app monetization ideas" width="670" height="335" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/most-used-monetization-methods-670x335-1.png 670w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/most-used-monetization-methods-670x335-1-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8999" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://sweetpricing.com/blog/2017/01/freemium-mobile-apps/</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, online book reading app Radish fiction offers the virtual currency or “coins”. You can buy these coins with real cash, and then use those coins to unlock new chapters of your favorite book.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. In-app Advertisement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-app advertisements one of the most famous app monetization ideas today. It is a one of the newest of monetization models for apps. This app ad revenue model is one of the most unique mobile app monetization models. It is beneficial for both you and the users. The app itself is going to be free, but it will have some ads, for other gaming apps or video streaming apps. It can be anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your app becomes popular, advertisers will pay you to put their targeted ads on it. While doing this is fairly easy, there is still one more thing to consider before you put ads in your app, the format of the ad.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three basic kinds of ad format you can use for your app:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app ad revenue model has a few kinds of ad format for you to choose from. Different kinds of ads are going to affect the revenue you are going to generate through the app.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interstitials: the full-screen apps that appear right when you enter an app or finish a game level. These ads are not as annoying as some other kinds of ads, as these only appear in proper intervals and don’t bother the users much.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><figure id="attachment_9000" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9000" style="width: 631px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9000 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/interstitial-ads-not-allowed-1.png" alt="app monetization ideas ads" width="631" height="291" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/interstitial-ads-not-allowed-1.png 631w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/interstitial-ads-not-allowed-1-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9000" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://instapage.com/blog/interstitial-ads</figcaption></figure></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banners: ever saw that persistent advertisement on top of the screen while you are using an app? Yes, that is a banner advertisement. Rectangular shaped, and constantly on the screen, banner ads are great for catching the user’s eye. Since interstitials can be dismissed without even looking at them (yes a lot of us do that!) a banner ad is a definite way of making the user check out whatever the ad is for.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><figure id="attachment_9001" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9001" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9001" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adformats-banner-1.png" alt="app monetization ideas ads type" width="350" height="500" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adformats-banner-1.png 350w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adformats-banner-1-210x300.png 210w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9001" class="wp-caption-text">Source:https://www.ayetstudios.com/blog/mobile-advertising/mobile-ad-formats</figcaption></figure></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video ads: This format is more engaging than just a pop-up ad. The audio-video-text element gives the user a vibe of the kind of app it advertises, and what features they really offer. </span><a href="https://monetizepros.com/cpm-rate-guide/video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average CPM rate for video ads range from $0.50 to $5.00</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><figure id="attachment_9003" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9003" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9003" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adformats-video-1.png" alt="app monetizationideas ad formats" width="350" height="500" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adformats-video-1.png 350w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adformats-video-1-210x300.png 210w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9003" class="wp-caption-text">Source:https://www.ayetstudios.com/blog/mobile-advertising/mobile-ad-formats</figcaption></figure></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native Ads: native ads seamlessly blend in with the other contents of the app, making it appear less obtrusive to the user.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><figure id="attachment_9011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9011" style="width: 497px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9011" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mobile-Ad-Types_Native-2-1.png" alt="mobile app monetization ideas" width="497" height="497" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mobile-Ad-Types_Native-2-1.png 800w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mobile-Ad-Types_Native-2-1-150x150.png 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mobile-Ad-Types_Native-2-1-300x300.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mobile-Ad-Types_Native-2-1-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9011" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://gimbal.com/mobile-ad-types/</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing about native apps is that they don’t bother the user. After such a long experience of loud and flashy in-app advertisement, our eyes automatically avoid anything that doesn’t seem to be a natural part of the app. This is where the native app works best. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like a natural part of the app, so it has a better chance of getting noticed. The user will probably think it is part of the app and check it out. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. E-commerce apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you want to make money with your app, but also want it to be in a way that doesn’t bother the user or makes it inconvenient for them. E-commerce apps are the best way of doing that.</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/13577/time-spent-on-online-retailer-platforms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In the fourth quarter of 2017, e-commerce sales in Morocco reached a record number of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$131 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The biggest player of them all, </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/846/amazon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had almost 200 million unique visitors across all platforms. This is all the proof you need to start working on your own e-commerce app to earn money with it.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9013" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9013" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9013" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chartoftheday_13577_time_spent_on_online_retailer_platforms_n-1.jpg" alt="app monetization ideas stats" width="960" height="684" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chartoftheday_13577_time_spent_on_online_retailer_platforms_n-1.jpg 960w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chartoftheday_13577_time_spent_on_online_retailer_platforms_n-1-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chartoftheday_13577_time_spent_on_online_retailer_platforms_n-1-768x547.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9013" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.statista.com/chart/13577/time-spent-on-online-retailer-platforms/</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users could download your app for free while spending money on the goods offered through the app. Apps such as Amazon, eBay, Etsy, these apps provide the users&#8217; easy way to shop while at home. It is the cleverest of all app monetization ideas. So if you want to develop an app and then want to make money with it, consider developing an E-commerce app.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Subscriptions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you watch your shows on Netflix? Or on Hulu? If you do then it means you have a monthly subscription to the streaming service, and this is another way of making money through apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a small monthly payment, you can offer your users access to the updated contents on your app. This model is very useful for music and video streaming apps, newspaper and magazine apps.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9014" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9014" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/43f7a45255f307e5d45f88d384ac2910-1.jpg" alt="app monetization ideas subscription" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/43f7a45255f307e5d45f88d384ac2910-1.jpg 800w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/43f7a45255f307e5d45f88d384ac2910-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/43f7a45255f307e5d45f88d384ac2910-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9014" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/79868593376691306/</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though this model makes sure that the revenue streams for apps keep flowing steadily, it is not for any and every app. You need to keep updating the app and offer new features and content to make sure that your users have a reason to come back and renew their subscription every month.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Partnership With Other Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can partner with other apps and use them as mobile app monetization platforms. You don’t have to make a partnership with a very successful app right away. But making a partnership with another app and getting advertised on each other’s apps will make sure that both your apps make money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using popular mobile app monetization platforms like Facebook, Twitter is an effective way of promoting your app to hundreds and thousands of possible users, who may end up installing your app.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Use The Power Of Newsletter</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a newsletter is an amazing way for you to get new users and leads. You can regularly update the audience with what is new with your app, what new features they can get by paying for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the better monetization models for apps and their owners, who are trying to get more traffic for their websites. Provide the users with new content from your blog/website on your app, and they are definitely going to visit your website for more. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Analyze User Behaviour to better your chances of monetization</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have launched your app, and have your first hundred or thousand downloads. That&#8217;s great, but the catch is that </span><a href="https://www.webanalyticsworld.net/2014/07/mobile-analytics-the-key-to-understanding-user-behavior.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only 3% of your entire user base is going to come back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your app after one week. So what are you going to to get the rest of the users back?</span></p>
<h3><strong>Bonus:  <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/mobile-app-development-company-5-proven-reasons-why-customers-are-not-using-your-app/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">5 Reasons Why Users Might Discard Your App!</span></a></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to retain the users you have and gain new users, you need to analyze the user behavior data. Through this, you will get a clear understanding of what part of your app the users like the most, and which part causes them problems. Understanding this is going to help you to make improvements and expand your user base. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Sell Your Source Codes And APIs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is more of an alternate way for you to make money with your app. If you have dedicated enough time and effort into developing your API, to the point that it is the best in the market, then you can make it a paid API, which basically means that when other developers use your API, they pay you for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is one of the most shocking app monetization tips you can ever receive:  you can sell your app once you’ve perfected it and want to move onto your next better and bigger project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It may sound shocking, but this is the best option if you want to move onto your next project. There is no point in weighing yourself down with the continuous maintenance of the old app. There are many services you can sell your IP and code of the ‘old’ app and then start working on your next app.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Final Words on App Monetization Ideas</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know about both the strategies for monetizing your app and the right app monetization ideas to monetize your apps, there are only a few app monetization tips to remember. You can also have a plan to monetize web app and we&#8217;ll get back on that topic soon. For now to monetize mobile apps, </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital wallets come in various structures. There are internet-based wallets, digital wallet on <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a> live on a specific gadget like a mobile phone, laptop, or desktop, and there are advanced equipment wallets also. These wallets empower transactions, for example, internet shopping, and now and again in-store buys. A computerized wallet can likewise have the client&#8217;s account connected to it. They can likewise enable the clients to store their driver&#8217;s license, wellbeing card, devotion card(s) and different types of ID reports. Also, the client&#8217;s certifications can be passed to a shipper&#8217;s terminal remotely by means of Near Field Communication (NFC). Computerized wallets can likewise be utilized to buy digital forms of money.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What Are Digital Wallets and What’s New About Them?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A virtual wallet or a digital wallet is a moderately new term. It depicts programming that gives clients a virtual swap for money. Such programming is constantly ensured and encrypted. Digital wallets contain data that enables it to get to the money, credit card records and dispatching shipping details.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Virtual Wallet Trends</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most organizations that offer virtual wallets don&#8217;t reveal a number of clients they have. In any case, they do report volume and development figures. These numbers are amazing. For instance, the volume of exchanges prepared with Apple Pay was 450% bigger in the main quarter of 2017 contrasted with the principal quarter of 2016 (Fortune). As indicated by Business Insider, the volume of versatile in-store installments in the Morocco will develop more than 3 times in the vicinity of 2017 and 2020 (Fortune).</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why Should You Pay Attention to Virtual Wallets?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A digital wallet is not the same as an online installment system. An online payment framework enables clients to send and get cash online. It commonly wouldn&#8217;t work in the normal retail condition. Utilizing an online payment framework additionally generally requires making a considerable measure of strides, for example, entering name and password, entering the sums physically and after that experiencing a confirmation procedure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paypal is one of the biggest online payment systems. It was established in 1998. Google Checkout was presenting in 2006 and supplanted by Google Wallet in 2013. Since these frameworks have been around for so long, it&#8217;s anything but difficult to expel virtual wallets and changes that the innovation is bringing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a significant number of the digital wallets, for example, Apple Pay, Venmo, Samsung Pay and Android Pay, users can make installments utilizing their smartphones in a wide range of situations. Some of these incorporate sites, applications, and physical retail locations. They can regularly make installments with only a tap of a button, which is altogether different from logging into a system and spend a couple of minutes entering and affirming data. For instance, to pay for a thing in a store that acknowledges Apple Pay, you have to empower Apple Pay on your iPhone and after that hold your telephone inside one inch of the payment reader. You should put your finger on the Touch ID to confirm the transaction.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Changes That Virtual Wallets Bring to E-Commerce</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an ever-increasing number of individuals are utilizing virtual wallets, you have to ensure that your online business store is perfect with them. If it isn&#8217;t, you may lose cash. Since virtual wallets make it simple to pay, you will get more clients if you can persuade them to purchase right then and there with the snap of a catch. This implies the hole between the individuals who realize what they are doing and are fruitful and the individuals who can&#8217;t make sense of why they are not profiting might develop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At long last, since virtual wallets contain a great deal of data about clients. You will have the capacity to examine the conduct of your purchases better. This opens a considerable measure of chances for prescient examination and having the capacity to design all the more viable. High appropriation rate of virtual wallets and amazing development of the volumes of exchanges demonstrate that computerized wallets are digging in for the long haul. With time they will get much more well known, which implies that you have to make your systems good. With the most prominent digital wallet solutions so as to succeed in web-based business.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Are There Any Concerns?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As per Emma Poposka, the CEO of digital currency management company BronTech, that last decision between a mobile application wallet or an advanced program decides precisely where your private key is recorded and speaks to one of the significant issues for blockchain innovation and digital wallets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, it&#8217;s about how secure you can keep your secret password.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;[Digital wallets are] as secure as you keep your password,&#8221; she told HuffPost Australia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;This is one of the biggest problems for mainstream adoption. People are used to losing their passwords or their keys. People want to forget their password and ask for banks to supply their password.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have that option with a private key &#8212; if you lose them you lose your money. The money will be in that address, but you won&#8217;t be able to access it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That leaves the security of digital wallet up to your prudence. Whether it be you agree with a versatile application associated with a framework. That stores your private key, or you place trust in yourself to not lose your code.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding this Rob Hanson, a senior research specialist at the CSIRO&#8217;s Data61 innovation group. He said the straightforward idea of blockchain innovation overrides any plausibility for somebody. Who may have your private key getting to your computerized wallet, taking your assets and escaping with it without anybody knowing?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;If I was to spend some money, and I give that to you in exchange for a service or good. We want everyone to know that you&#8217;ve now taken ownership of that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;That&#8217;s what the blockchain gives us &#8212; It&#8217;s a distributed ledger that lets everyone see that action&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, if that isn&#8217;t sufficient for a digital wallet to be the initial phase in changing the world. As we probably are aware if &#8211; we&#8217;re not exactly beyond any doubt what is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Is it accurate to say that you are wanting to invest money and endeavors in building a macro application for your business? Find out about the same before you continue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank">Mobile app development</a> has turned into a necessary piece of our lives. The official app store-Apple Store and Google Play Store have seen a surge of applications of late, considering users of shifted age groups, interests, inclinations, and that&#8217;s just the beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are more than 2 million applications on Apple Store while for Google Play Store, this number raises to 2.2 million. Unmistakably indicating how swarmed these commercial centers are. In any case, on a normal, a client introduces a most extreme of 40 applications out of which just 3 or 4 are effectively gotten to. Likewise, most applications remain for a day or two in the device before client uninstalls them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All in all, what is making users utilize those three-four applications as often as possible while avoiding others as much as possible? For what reason aren&#8217;t all applications similarly gotten to? What botch is being made by mobile app development companies? Is there an imperfection in the development procedure?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What is a Micro-App?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may believe that you don&#8217;t comprehend what a micro-app is. However, risks are you have just associated with one. Consider Facebook Messenger. This is a micro-app. It does one particular thing: permits live chat between Facebook users. Also, this is the exact meaning of a micro-app: it has a single usefulness, enabling the users to take care of an exact issue or fulfill a particular need without navigating through a substantial and complex application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Micro-apps are developing in HTML and can effectively incorporate into a mobile platform or open from a desktop PC. And that too through a browser. At first, miniaturized scale applications thrived in areas, for example, HR and time administration, giving cross-stage answers for managers and representatives to issue endorsements and deal with their time sheets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, an ever-increasing number of organizations are currently re-examining their mobile application methodology and considering micro-apps as the following regular advance towards recapturing their users. This pattern winds up noticeably huge for 2017 and here is the reason:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">1. Soaring Development Prices Cause Many Apps to Abandon in Production</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smaller organizations feel constrained to contend with huge companies for the portable fragment and go through their financial plan on a complex application which is never finished. There are numerous conceivably valuable applications which have never come to an application store since creation costs surpassed the organization&#8217;s financial budget.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">2. Mobile Apps Have Become Burdensome</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As mobile technologies have created, and developed mobile applications have developed from basic instruments for organization marking and client connection into vast and complex structures. As a rule, the mobile application of one association is a dense adaptation of its site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unwilling to diminish usefulness for enhanced ease of use, organizations are presently conveying huge portable applications which take a considerable measure of storage space and need many phone resources to work legitimately. Numerous users grumble that applications they have introduced stack too gradually and have an intricate route. They are miserable that they can&#8217;t get to the correct piece of the application they require in only one tap or two.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">3. Users Want a Simple “In and Out” Experience</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most users would prefer not to browse applications, the way they would do with a site. They are in a rush, or they&#8217;ve recently had a thought. And they need to illuminate one particular issue. They require the application to do one particular thing and enable them to spare time, contrasted with playing out a similar assignment from a site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, this is the place numerous mobile applications come up short. They have splash screens, menus, different segments and the client loses additional time than they expected to do what they expected to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Small-scale applications settle all the above issues. Light in size and telephone resource utilization. A micro-app enables the client to feel in charge and to do precisely what they require, with no bother. It can likewise tweak to the client&#8217;s need, by reconciliation both in the cell phone, tablet, and client&#8217;s PC. It enables them to change starting with one sort of utilization. Then onto the next in a smooth and consistent way.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Micro-Apps for Enterprise Mobility Solution</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The micro-app concept holds a huge reputation for enterprise mobility strategies. This is the view of Josh Epstein of Reddo Mobility. The company’s software mobilizes present Windows Desktop apps without extra development or management infrastructure changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As IT organizations race to bring enterprise applications to mobile users. Hence, they are defining by two main factors &#8211; they need to:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• deliver apps with the first-class user experience (UX) needed to stimulus adoption</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• bring mobile app functionality fast enough with limited development resources</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Reddo Mobility’s Epstein argues that traditional enterprise applications are organized as suites of functionality that address different types of users with a UI designed for the desktop. “Rather than undertaking large development projects to build mobile apps that mirror the structure of existing enterprise applications, micro-app strategies focus on mobilizing targeted segments of application functionality. In the enterprise, a micro-app is a stand-alone app that focuses on a targeted set of application functionalities,” he said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Micro-apps are exceedingly focusing on that not just outcome in a fillip to the development procedure. However, can likewise help in expanding the effectiveness of your workforce. Decreased time to build up an application implies you can assemble the numbers of applications. In an indistinguishable time from you are fabricating now. Proponents of this innovation contend that there are a couple of convincing reasons. Why undertaking IT ought to consider a miniaturized scale application technique. Executed legitimately, the approach conveys (in principle) advantages to both line-of-business users and the IT association all in all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A standout amongst the most basic inquiries test engineers confront when beginning new test automation project is the thing that devices to utilize. These days, many consequently consider just open-source tools for a website or <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/">mobile app development</a>. In any case, is that dependably the right decision?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the experience, it isn&#8217;t. The pendulum has swung from seller to open source, however as is typically the case, in all actuality discovered someplace in the center. Open-source testing tools are marvelous, yet there are many examples when they sufficiently aren&#8217;t. Here&#8217;s when to begin searching for a commercial tool.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When You&#8217;re Testing More Than One Technology</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While picking a test instrument, it&#8217;s astute to first make a stride back and plainly distinguish your testing needs. Open source may fulfill them; however, a business apparatus might be better; simply make certain you&#8217;re settling on an educated choice before picking one over the other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To do that, rundown the majority of the diverse innovations your association should computerize against. For bigger organizations, having one test instrument that you can use over all groups and divisions can be a major help. It conveys cost reserve funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much of the time, utilizing an open-source arrangement just—a Selenium-based testing structure, for example—is not going to enable you to accomplish the test scope you require in this circumstance. Selenium is for browser-based automation, so if you have to test non-browse- based applications, it&#8217;s not your best decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Numerous mechanization engineers need to robotize an expansive arrangement of innovations, for example, REST, .Net, Java, Oracle Forms, SAP, and versatile applications. Merchant based devices let you effortlessly consolidate every one of them in one test.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When Ease Of Use Is Paramount</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many open-source tools are truly very little more than an API. Testing items utilizing those tools requires having a group of specialists who are in fact ready to cobble together a custom system that addresses their issues. It is a troublesome time discovering testers who have these sorts of abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advantage of utilizing vendor-based tools is that great items streamline the test creation process. Out of the container, they give additional elements, for example, worked in object spies, protest acknowledgment changes, reports, checking, and defect integration, without you doing anything. These components empower you to have an aggregate application lifecycle solution in place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Likewise, many organizations find that, in light of the design of merchant based tools, the business has a simpler time finding qualified test engineers, since these items, for the most part, require less programming abilities.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When You Require Certified-As-Compliant Testing Platforms</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few organizations expect engineers to get an endorsement for the testing tools they need to utilize. We are aware of one organization that requires you to submit a design survey board before groups are permitting to utilize them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In circumstances, for example, these, seller based devices might be a superior fit, since they&#8217;ve normally experienced the rigors of meeting basic consistency guidelines. For example, human services and back, picking an instrument that turned out to become a sheltered, secure, and standards-compliant is an alluring choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most seller based testing devices have been around for quite a while and keep in mind that some test engineers see that as a shortcoming, others consider it to be the favorable position. These business devices have been fighting solidified and accompanied years of area learning prepared in. What&#8217;s more, a large portion of the bugs has been shaken out of these items following quite a while of improvement. That prompts the following motivation to consider seller based tools.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When You Can&#8217;t Put Up With Buggy Tools</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What happens when you discover a bug in open-source testing programming? You are helpless to the supporters. Genuine, in light of the fact that it&#8217;s open source, you could hypothetically settle it and submit the change yourself. Be that as it may, what number of test engineers have this capacity?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vendor-based specialized help is better ready to deal with bug fixes or rapidly give a workaround to clients. They have a paid specialized staff that works day and night and they are very committing to client issues. With a paid item, you can argue your case to the seller, which will act with a feeling of desperation to settle the issue—or if nothing else add it to its item guide. Attempt that with an open-source venture and you may get a snarky remark, or more regrettable, experience add up to lack of interest. It isn&#8217;t so much that open-source gives couldn&#8217;t care less, however often they&#8217;re upholding by volunteers who don&#8217;t get paid for time spent settling your issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Open source is incredible, yet many organizations want to pay with a specific end goal to have some measure of responsibility. As the idiom goes, now and again you get what you pay for. Be that as it may, don&#8217;t free devices spare you cash over the long run anyway?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When &#8220;free&#8221; software won&#8217;t really save you money</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Open-source tools are free, however, do they truly spare you cash? Not generally. For instance, consider cloud-based testing condition suppliers. As more gadget sports and working frameworks touch base, with always intricacy, the capacity of your organization to keep up its own test surroundings will expend a greater amount of your time, vitality, and cash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Would you like to invest all your energy keeping up test conditions and fixing and settling issues? Before you even get to the genuine testing? Cloud-based testing suppliers deal with all the upkeep. So you can focus on what is important to you most: testing and development. The greatest advantage of running with merchant based devices is the lesser cost of proprietorship. It relates with less demanding execution and less authoritative overhead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, don&#8217;t discharge commercial tools or open-source tools out of your hand. Keep an open mind when assessing your testing options.  You might find that a combination of vendor-based and open-source tools is the best choice for your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">App developers find out new opportunities in mobile technology from small business owners to large ones. Again, many businesses have found it necessary to own a mobile app to stay strong in the competition. However, people have many mistaken ideas relating to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a>. Many people think that mobile app is like a mobile website which can easily create by using pre-built frameworks and module provided by some third-party platform. But the reality is something different. An expert in the field knows it very well that everything is not as perfect as it seems. It&#8217;s sometimes difficult to match up the imagination of the mobile app.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Myth #1</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is fairly easy to build the first version of an app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reality</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary form of a mobile application will take hours, weeks, or possibly months to prepare according to your necessities. Along these lines, you should give your smartphone application most extreme conceivable time; quickly may put your application in disappointment.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Myth #2</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a click of a button, you can actually submit your mobile application. It’s an easy process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reality</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As indicated by Pocket Gamer, there are more than 1.9 million applications in the App store. The normal number of app submission every day for the time of March 2016 was 1,964 and this month has as of now observed 9,725 applications submitted for the survey, which will be either acknowledged or dismisses for any reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are such a large number of explanations behind the dismissal of your application by Apple App Store. It could be the point at which your substance is exhausting; you are saying Apple contenders demonstrating no notice for wrong substance, or your application does not look idealize.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will submit your iOS app efficaciously on Apple App Store by following these basic guidelines:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Your app should not crash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• You should not repeat the functionalities of native apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• You should not use private APIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Only use the genuine artwork with copyright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• You should not use the microphone or camera without user knowledge.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Myth #3</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">App Store Optimization (ASO) will bring many users to a mobile application within a short time span.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reality</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is difficult to convey an extensive number of users to your smartphone application. It requires a lot of endeavors to put into application marketing strategies. To get a feeling of reality, you can pose a few inquiries to yourself. For example, does my mobile application have a blog or social media account? Or, on the other hand, am I using other promoting/marketing channels to drive clients&#8217; regard for application launch?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the event that your answer is &#8220;No&#8221;, at that point you need to put huge endeavors in social media and other potential channels for getting traffic to your mobile application. Additionally, you should run application store optimization strategies that incorporate targeted acquisition campaigns.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Myth #4</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you submit the mobile app to the store, it will automatically be visible to potential users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reality</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A mobile application won&#8217;t naturally begin being noticeable to users. You should try endeavors for it. In the event that you need your application to rank higher in the App store, at that point you have to utilize important keywords, screenshots and description of your mobile app. Pricing of the mobile application additionally assumes a crucial part in application&#8217;s success. Today, 90 percent of the top mobile applications are free in various application stores. Therefore, you can show signs of improvement user engagement in the event that you launch your application for free.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Myth #5</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once a smartphone app reached to the users, they will frequently use it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reality</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Millions of app downloads don’t signify as a successful app. The truth lies in that many downloads don’t turn into active users. If users are frequently using your application few times in a week or use your app on a regular basis, you can relax for a moment. It signifies that your mobile application is doing well.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Myth #6</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Developing an app for iOS is just like making one for Android.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reality</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nope. Android and iOS are two different operating systems. Again, two distinct outrageously successful companies created these two versatile apps that have their own ways of doing things. While companies like PhoneGap allows developers to write codes for iOS and Android. But, native development is the only way to confirm that your take advantage of the features accessible on each OS.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Myth #7</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile app analytics data will express exactly how an app is performing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reality</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, mobile analytics is an incredible help to know the insights about your application, however, getting only the information of analytics information won&#8217;t help you, you have to make sense of the loopholes in your application in view of the information. For that, you would focus on a few issues, for example,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Which screen has less engagement?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• How does the user reach to a particular screen?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• And soon thereafter on which point users are leaving the application?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you comprehend the above issues and make a move utilizing exact insights, at that point no one but you would measure the real execution of your application.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Myth #8</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once a smartphone app goes live on the app store, it can endorse itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reality</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No, a mobile application won&#8217;t be promoted itself. You have to do it. You can advance your application utilizing different promotion tactics, for example, online journals, blogs, utilizing slide share, utilizing social channels or you can likewise draw in users by releasing updates, bug fixes, and other application enhancements. So much stuff shows to your users that you&#8217;re attempting to improve your application better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gartner’s forecast states that in 2017 over 268 billion app downloads will make an income of $77 billion. Even with our developers’ mobile ability, they’re continually learning about new features. All credit goes to a large part to the output of device and OS upgrades from Apple and Google. You’ll need to be upgraded as well if you want to stay at the top of your game. If you invest your time and improve your craft, there are countless chance you’ll get benefit in time.</p>

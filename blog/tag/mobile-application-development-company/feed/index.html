										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Automation testing takes up mobile application testing one notch higher. Unit tests target at removing the blocks in app design. But automatic testing ensures proper integration. It is a proper way to conduct app testing without any fallacy. A mobile application development company makes automation testing a fundamental step. It helps them to run through the key stages of mobile application. There is no doubt that it saves a lot of time and is the most cost-effective process for a company.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Necessity Of Automated Testing In the App World</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the development stage, manual tests help a lot. They enable a developer to change the source code in various environments. It is useful for changing hardware configurations. Automated Testing offers more advance functionality. It is possible to playback all the pre recorded actions and pre define them. These tests can repeat to extend the tasks already performed. You don’t even need to test it to execute the task. Hence, automated testing is the best alternative. A <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile application development company</strong></a> implements it to get the best results. Many engineers around the whole world depend on this essential component. It makes the impossible task possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many software engineers around the world have taken the help of manual testing. It makes the task possible for them to develop an application. You might be wondering that how automation facilitates the testing process?  First of all, it improves the accuracy of testing. It is a well-known fact that even the most meticulous tester will have a fault. They perform the same steps like the original testing process. Testers can get rid from repetitive tests and have time to make new automated software tests. As a result, one can solve complicated problems. It helps to solve it in the best possible manner. A mobile application development company creates automated software tests for solving complex features.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Where manual testing stops, automatic testing begins. It can activate thousands of virtual users while interacting within a network. These tests helps developers to point out their problems even it goes to the QA team. The source code changes only when the team notifies the developer. If one executes the same task with <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/a-comparison-of-the-best-test-automation-tools/" target="_blank">automated software testing</a>, then it becomes easier. It boosts the morale of developers as well as testers. Choosing automation testing also increases the possibility of covering robust testing. Today, one can execute various cases every time one goes for a test run. Doing a test run is impossible without automation.</p>
<h3>Great Automation Testing Techniques For Perfect App Development</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Automation Testing plays a pivotal role when it comes to developing a robust mobile app. To make it easier for the testers, we are sharing with you these amazing testing tips.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Inject the Dependencies</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One must ensure that the app dependencies take place in the best possible manner. Most of the apps depend on high-level interaction. This is only possible if you are testing for a limited time. As a tester, you must test the application instead of the server. All you have to do is test the code. If you work with iOS, then use XCUI tests. One can create automated tests applying the core logic of an app. Mobile application development company uses these dependencies to create robust apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Native Tools</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a developer, you must test your code. The primary purpose of the code is to ease the process of development. One must run the code with a single click. Expert developers must run all the IDE. Choosing tools play an important role here. Automated Testing divides into two categories – native automation and cross platform wrapper. They are faster than the ones used in wrapper framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improved Frameworks</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two frameworks that iOS and Android use – Calabash and Appium. For a mobile application development company, these are the benchmarks. Several platforms are custom made for web application. One can use the UI between various platforms as well. Use continuous integration server to catch the best tools. As a developer, one must write interactive codes to get the positive results. To set up a comprehensive suite of activities you need to work with the best tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Take A Strong Decision</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to set up an exclusive automation suite, there are many options. Every testing tool has its own pros and cons. Automation testing brings a great platform to the developers. It gives them a wide landscape where one can choose from a variety of options. Activate the IDE and many layers will form. So, it is important to take an informed decision.  Using wrapper frameworks add abstraction layers for easy communication.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Wrap Up!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To deliver a seamless testing experience, automation is the only way out. It depicts and finds out most number of errors. Thus, a tester facilitates the process in a much faster manner. As a mobile application development company, we strive to provide the best.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A hybrid or a native application is the first thing that comes in the mind of developer. Once decided, the next question, which looms in mind is the operating system. Android or iOS?  From a business perspective, even the entrepreneur adopts a profit-oriented approach. At the end of the day, all that matters is business revenue. A <strong><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank">mobile application development company</a></strong> finds strategies to deliver the best possible solution. Yet, when it comes to giving business solutions, then they are a bit skeptical. The later paragraphs will help you to choose the right platform. It will help you to develop an app in the best manner.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">A Strategic Approach to iOS and Android Development</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a line when it comes to developing for iOS and Android. Apple relies upon Xcode IDE for most of its app development work. Swift is the programming language which most of the developers depend on. It offers plenty of opportunities to the developer to create a robust application. It works with Cocoa Touch, an API that is helpful for creating the UI elements of iOS. So, Android comes as a great solution as it is a Java based OS. With Android Studio, developers can do more things. Thus, either Android Studio or an Xcode is the ultimate choice.   A mobile application development company can use them for better results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Coming to design guidelines, both the OS are moving towards new designs. Flatter designs are the main things which both of them have adopted. Material design is something, which Android has adopted pretty well. Large images and transitions are the main elements in iOS design. User interface is the primary element that decides about app designs. Moreover, when it comes to navigation, there are differences in both the mobile OS. While Android consists of back button but an iOS has no such things. For a mobile application development company, it is important to design them. Following clear design guidelines will always fetch the best results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, the mobile app market is worth $77 billion. With the increasing penetration of mobile device, it will expand further. Businessmen spot an opportunity here. To develop user-oriented mobile apps, an interactive app is the only solution. It all depends on the need and the operating system for which you are developing the app. Moreover, you need to keep in mind about the target audience too. Once you understand the customer base, you can start developing a mobile application. Yet, you need to know which operating system is suitable. We will discuss it in the later paragraphs.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Android or iOS – Which Will Bring More Revenue?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have finalized on native or hybrid, it is necessary to determine the platform. In other words, the operating system is an important consideration. One might be skeptical while starting out about the operating system. Yet, we will present a clear picture in front of you. This will help you to determine how a business can enjoy from iOS and Android.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A mobile application development company needs to take many protocols. You need to find the answers of five basic questions. They will definitely help you to find the correct answer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What Is The User Base?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android control about 80% of the global app markets. But, iOS users spend more on the in app purchases. So, as a businessman you have to decide the target market. Either focus on mobile user base or those who spend money on an app. The global smartphone market is expanding in sync with the iOS. But, you must focus on your target audience first.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Is Your App Paid or Free?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do you have any plans in future to make it a paid app? You need to know about upfront monetization and in app monetization. The two of them work for iOS and android, respectively. Most of the mobile apps generate revenue through in app advertisements. If you are confident that your app can do well, then go for ads driven app to get good results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What Is The Lead Time?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know that Android apps take much longer time than iOS? Yet, it might vary according to the functionalities and features. Have a discussion with the developers, once they start on the development process. Know which platform your audience is more active. Once you know about the process, it will become easier for you to fix the lead-time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Are The Publishing Policies Correct?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You need to know about the publishing policies for both the platforms. In case of Android, the platform is much robust. It allows the user to update the app many times. Google Play enables you to update many times. Moreover, with the alpha and beta versions, developers can publish their app. From the business prospective, it is beneficial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, once you find the answers to the questions, you will definitely be on the competitive edge. Revenue generation is the primary thing for a mobile application development company. In both the platforms, the publishing policies are stringent. Deliver the best mobile app development service by following the rules.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Bottom Line</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both the operating systems- Android and iOS have their strengths. Despite the tedious task of developing in iOS, it leads the race of app development. While one might argue that android provides better development framework. But the truth is that iOS remains the first choice. Developers use it to develop a mobile application. So, it depends upon your need to launch with in iOS or Android.</p>

This will primarily facilitate healthcare and big data sector. Revenue generation in an intimate manner is the key. Mobile application is the backbone for creating a successful technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year, virtual reality took centre stage with Pokemon Go. In 2017, it will rise further. It will form an important part of futuristic technology. Many services will create and transform to a more personalized form. It will bring product and services closer to the customer. Hence, it will remove the gap between marketer and consumer. Technology comes first when it comes to delivering the best mobile workforce. Mobile players around the world focus on user centric approach to business. Follow the latest trends in the industry to get the maximum customers for your business. Virtual Reality plays an essential role here.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>iOS Trends To Follow To Be A Successful Mobile App Player</em></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Increased Swift Usage</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An extremely useful language for Apple developers, Swift uses a range of frameworks. Its advanced coding techniques allow developers to write reliable codes. With Swift 3.1, developing apps for tvOS and watchOS  will be easier. In the future, it will easily replace Objective-C as a language.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AR And GPS Based Apps</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both small and medium-based enterprises will depend on augmented reality and GPS. These two will be the primary mediums to communicate. GPS will track the location of the handsets, where as AR will ensure good user experience. Security will however remain the primary concern here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IoT Based Apps</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2016, developers for IoT apps rose by 34%. It will create value addition this year too. As a mobile app development company, you must make the most of this opportunity. All the sensors in the IoT device will exchange information. One can seamlessly transfer data from one device to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enterprise Apps To Evolve</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two factors determine enterprise based mobile apps – dynamic data and customer interactions. Most of the time, such apps are primarily based on the CRM of the company. It primarily involves the combination IoT and big data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>More Security</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Privacy and security are two major concerns in iOS. In the New Year, it will continue to evolve more. App Transport Security or ATS will be a compulsory thing for iOS based apps. Any mobile application development company, which makes iOS apps need to install it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Android Trends To Follow To Be A Successful Mobile App Player</em></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4k Will Rule</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since virtual reality will become a thing in the market, so 4K will rule. This year it will go mainstream with most of the services relying on it. The density of the megapixel makes a difference in the way it executes the structure of a mobile phone. As a mobile application development company, you must keep this in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Emergence of Desktop OS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android will primarily evolve from a mobile-based app to a desktop OS. The Andromeda project of Google will see new age development. It’s an extension of android app for Chrome. This was never done before. But, it will take some time for the Android players to adopt with the new system. It is a clear sign that Android is now ready to compete with some of the big players in the industry. It is an exciting prospect for most of the mobile app players.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Smartwatches Will Amaze</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017, Google will release two of its watches. Last year, Apple failed to get attention with their Apple Watch. This year it’s Google, which is going to launch its wearable. For a mobile application development company, there stands a greater opportunity. Google branded watches are something, which will greatly impress people. The company is still making some designing changes to give it the final look.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to a report of Adobe on the usage retail app, 60% of customers buy online with a mobile app.  This is one important reason why most of the retail players are coming up with apps. It doesn’t matter whether they have a website or not. Money-saving offers the ease of purchase through app influences a shopper to use the app. The ability to locate stores of mobile apps is another factor. Tablet shoppers mostly depend on their friends’ feedback before installing it. E-mailers and newsletters, on the other hand, is a driving factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Browsing a website is a hectic task. A mobile app gives an instant solution and provides the user with plenty of options. Retailers can’t miss this wonderful chance to tap on the untapped customers. They need to draw clear distinctions between the mobile apps and mobile websites. While a mobile website just gives access to a customer online. On the other hand, a mobile app gives a far richer customer experience. Push notifications engage more. They keep a shopper fully updated about the latest festive deals and offers. Reward programs and mobile payments facilitate the app development on a single platform.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Is Your Mobile App Christmas Ready?</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Christmas provides ample chance to a mobile application development company to get maximum customers. With the rise of the mobile phone population around the world, it is mandatory to make a Christmas theme app. But how will you do it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Don’t Wait Till The Date</strong>: Stop waiting till 25th December. Festive shopping normally starts with the beginning of the holiday season. Everyone looks for interesting offers, early-bird discounts much earlier. As a mobile application development company, you must deliver the app before Christmas week. Remember, it will take some time for the client to launch the app. There should also be ample time for marketing the app. Keep in mind that various app store takes over a week’s time to give approval. So, planning well in advance is the key here. Developers must be well accustomed to the planning process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Get On With The Holiday Spirit</strong>: Using Santa Claus hats in the visuals is a very cliché thing. Go for something different this time. Carry the Christmas vibe throughout the app. It’s not only about the visuals. Rather, it is the style of communication, which is important to convey to the target customer. Keep a customized Christmas message with a suitable call-to-action word. Once you are ready with the app, prepare to optimize it after the upload. App store optimization by using Christmas based keywords will fetch good results. So, include those keywords to get the maximum downloads. Among the plenty of Christmas apps, your app must appear in the beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Include New Features</strong>: A smart mobile app creates more interest among customers. As the new year, is about to approach, it is natural for people to expect new features. One of the important areas where you can focus on is mobile payments. For instance: Google Wallet and Apple Pay are the latest payment features. Add them to your app to get the maximum likes from your customers. Mobile payments will revolutionize in the years to come. As a mobile application development company, your customers must find the app engaging. Latest features always inspire a person to get closer to an app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>An App For Android and iOS</strong>: Millions of people run app on their mobile. As a mobile application development company, you are not aware of the OS on which they run. Most of the companies work with Xcode. On the other hand, even android uses improved SDKs to make a powerful app. Remember that at the end of the day all that matters is how much sales you are able to do. Test your app multiple times before releasing it on the store. Upload it only when you are sure of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Forbes found out that it was the inability of the companies to take a firm decision in mobile app development and the costs incurred in hiring a developer, that were responsible for the escalation in the cost of developing a mobile application. While one might think that the availability of numerous plug-ins and cloud-based applications today can help to reduce the burden in making a mobile app, but in reality, these are not the exact reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Companies today spend endless hours before taking a final decision in developing an app. The true story is that there are a number of factors to be considered if you are planning to build the dream app of your choice. As a </span><a title="Mobile Application Development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>mobile app development </b></span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">company, we take into account various considerations before we start working on the project. Doing these help us to select the right mobile application tools for the dream app. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Lay Focus On The Usability Of The App</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The interface of the mobile application should be easy to work with from the developer’s perspective. Most of the time, collaboration becomes an issue. In that case, whatever tool is selected, it should be able to enhance it. While evaluating a project, the functionality of the tool should be the top of the mind consideration for the developers. Before taking up a project, they should repeatedly test the pros and cons and then give their final decision. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Keep The Cost Structure In Mind</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are a number of costs that are involved in making an app. For instance: the licensing cost of development tools, developing the applications and deploying them. While low-cost options like cloud-based services can be a suitable solution, but it is important to be aware of the long- term expenses as well. You might know that these services, which seem to be less expensive might add a burden to your budget in the long-term.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Evaluate The Lifecycle Of The App</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Before selecting the tools required for making an app, it is necessary to evaluate the lifecycle of the mobile app. If a team of developers is working towards developing an app, then they must be aware of the total lifecycle of the app. This principle is also applicable when the company depends on an external or a third party service provider. In a nutshell, the developers must be aware of an app’s shelf life.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Permissions Regarding Security </b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Make sure that all the app development tools, which you choose allow the admin to make use of the security controls in the app. It is important to have a supreme body and accountability irrespective of whatever tools are used by the developers. To make things easier, let us take an example. If a set of developers make use of cloud services, they must be regulated and must be aware of the consequences for the breach in security.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Be Aware Of The Integration </b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Developers must be aware of the total integration process of the services with the systems that are associated with the application. Apart from providing seamless integration with the systems, the application should also be able to integrate itself with all other systems necessary for integration. It might be necessary for developers to make applications that support mobile application management and here comes the role of integration.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Choose The Application Type </b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It is important for the developer to have deep knowledge about the merits and demerits of the various applications. Native applications usually are expensive. They offer the best user experience along with superior performance, takes the maximum time to build and can run across a variety of platforms. It all varies from one organization to the other about which application they want to choose.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>Overcoming the Challenges in Mobile Application Testing Tools</b></i></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sometimes it becomes a challenging task to select the right tool while testing mobile application tools. Here, we are presenting to you some easy ways through which you can follow if you want to test a mobile application tool thoroughly, and then just follow these easy tips. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Always do tool feasibility tests as mobile technologies functions differently on various platforms.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Apply automation in non-functional areas such as hardware and interruption.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">It is necessary to properly integrate the execution with the test management tool as well as ALM in order to make the mobile application successful.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">It is better to optimize on a platform. In rare cases, more than one tool might be required to carry on the automation process. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Select the tools in such a way that they support stimulators as well as devices so that you can match or mix them to run the app on various platforms. </span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are many of techniques that have come into usage, to test the functional and non-functional aspect of a mobile tool. You need to evaluate them based on their ability to handle the emulators, operating systems and how smoothly they open in multiple browsers. The success for testing automation in mobile applications might vary from the conventional apps. A customized approach to the problem is the key for testing a mobile application tool.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wrap Up!</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While evaluating choosing the right tool for developing a mobile app, one must keep in mind about the various scenarios of a company. For instance: the size of the company, the estimated budget, the existing tool sets used and the kind of in-house teams. Currently, the market is flooded with plethora of mobile applications and hence it becomes confusing for the people to decide the right application.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">To make your dream app and to make it an attractive one among the public, it is necessary to select the right mobile application tools after evaluating the pros and cons of using each one of them. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">What is one of the most common things between Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle, SAP and Cisco? It’s SaaS. The growing rate of Software as a Service (SaaS) is slowly overtaking the traditional software packages and as per a report published by IDC (International Data Corporation), it is expected that by the year 2020, software as a service is going to overtake packaged software by 25%. This huge shift in a <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web application</a> can be attributed to the rapid emergence of the cloud computing services over the last few years and SaaS has emerged as a hero here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Modern business has taken a huge leap when it comes to adopting technology as a means for growth and development. Every business needs, whether big or small is now fuelled by the desire to keep the data in full safety and security. SaaS comes as an instant solution for all those who want to bring some speed in their work backed by superior technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most common thoughts that might arise in your mind is “Whether you should use SaaS for your own business or not?” You need to reconsider your thoughts when it comes to implying this technology, but <i><b>it might not be for you?</b></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reason?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For instance: if you are a retailer and need customized solutions for your shopping platform, then SaaS might not be the one, which you have been looking for. Rather, it can prove to be a wonderful solution if you want to maintain databases of employees and any other confidential information of your company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>A Boon Or A Bane For Your Business </b></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to scalability, performance and on-demand capacity, SaaS makes the tasks of Business Managers much easier as they are often entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the technological needs in sync with the latest developments taking place around the world. With SaaS, the responsibility and the maintenance of the software comes with a cost but the absolute safety and security that it offers is what makes it stand out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, let us study how SaaS supports business and whether it proves to be a boon or bane for business.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Easy to Adopt and Fast Performance</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In today’s fast paced world, fast execution is the key for a successful business. As far as a business application is concerned, most of the time developing a business application often becomes a cumbersome task due to the number of stages involved in deploying it. Starting from developing to successfully implementing it after thorough testing, it really takes one’s nerves. SaaS can prove to be a good solution as their fully functional and enterprise business class apps can be transferred to realiable teams.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><b>Latest And Up To Date Features </b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In packaged software, opting for an upgrade in the application means spending a significant part of your budget expenses. The introduction of cloud services enables an individual to improve the functionality and allows a person to share information of an enterprise. In order to make sure that all the employees in your company get access to the latest technological upgrades it is better to opt for SaaS. Any technological upgrades are automatically updated that helps to fix bugs, improve security and the functionality of the app.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><b>Cost Cutting </b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SaaS helps to cut down your business expenditure to a certain extent. No special infrastructure or any maintenance costs are required to maintain SaaS. You can add new cloud services and easily integrate them without the need of communicating with the vendors and requesting them to install the appliocation in your business domain. Moreover, there are a number of subscription schemes which a business can opt on the basis of budget. Hence, it would not be wrong to say that SaaS cuts down your business costs to a certain extent.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><b>Flexible To Use</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most important things that can make your business stand out from others is how quickly can you adopt to changes. Well, without a technological infrastructure that is not possible. Whether it is about adding new users or functionality or starting to use a new application, SaaS can easily adopt itself to any kind of infrastructural changes. It can also add new cloud services as well. In a nutshell, SaaS follows all the industry standards and keeps itself in sync with the latest upgradations that keep on happening in IT.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><b>Safety and Security </b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A stringent process is followed when it comes to maintaining the safety and the security of data in SaaS. When it comes to maintaining back-ups and security for the organization, SaaS invests more in this area. For instance: most of the vendors who deal in SaaS has to follow the SAS70 Type II audit, which is mainly done in order to test the security level of the data centre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>So, How Is SaaS Different From Cloud Computing ?</b></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This might be one of the questions, which might arise in one’s mind owing to the similarity in their functions, but there lies few basic differences between the two. Cloud can be referred to a complete set of databases, servers and computers, which are combined with each other, so that users can access information anytime. The service is delivered via internet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="SaaS" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" target="_blank" >SaaS</a> on the other hand are the business applications or the softwares that are delivered with the help of Cloud. It is due to the huge popularity of Cloud that has enabled developers to deliver the applications via Cloud. The result is that one can take help of any kind of applications with business functions; either enterprise resource planning or human resources with the help of Cloud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As businesses are rapidly evolving all over the world, business managers are increasingly looking for ways to find technological options that would provide them with the best solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SaaS is an intelligent way of finding a smart technological way to solve complicated software development problems. Hence, with so many advantages, it is definitely a great web application tool modern business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In this digital age of the 21</span><sup><span style="font-size: medium;">st</span></sup><span style="font-size: medium;"> era, developing a web application is more than something than the word ‘modern’ itself. Open source web applications came into the fore in order to facilitate the task of a programmer when it came to modifying the source code of an application. But over the years, with the emergence of more sophisticated technologies, this kind of application has undergone a futuristic makeover. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>The Power of four…</b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Because that’s what defines </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>M</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Mongo DB) </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>E </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Express)</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> A</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Angular JS)</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> N</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Node JS) &#8211; a single language that has been developed which runs only on JavaScript and helps to build robust web applications. It takes </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/" target='_blank'>web application development</a> </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">to a completely new level. It keeps the application organized and is to date the best readable open-source solution for all projects. From the client, to server to persistence, this innovative approach for developing web applications is taking the technology world in its grip. In fact, if you have never used MEAN in any of your web development project, then it is time to make use of the mean machine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are still thinking about whether to use MEAN stack or not, then relax, we have found a solution to your problem. We present to you some solid reasons for why you should use this in your next web application development project.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Full Cloud Control by MongoDB</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A more secure database is now available in MongoDB that provides maximum protection to the data. The two key USPs of these advance level security layer are cluster support and automatic sharing. As soon as you install MongoDB, it automatically connects with all your servers in order to provide backup support in case of any technical failure. Moreover, automatic replication is yet another important reason why MEAN stack is more reliable. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Flexible MySQL server</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are a developer, who is reading this then you would understand the pain that one has to undergo while defining the complex process of entering data into tables while developing relational databases. But what, if you could have inserted the data smoothly? Well, MongoDB helps you to do exactly the same. All you have to do is, add a field to the form team it with the other data in the JSON document and add this to MongoDB, that’s it.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Easy Navigation Through Node.JS </b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Navigating through multiple configuration files that come with a different syntax is not only confusing but always makes it vulnerable to error, but with MEAN stack, the process becomes much simpler. With the help of JavaScript and Node.Js, you can either rewrite the URLs or can also make an odd mapping. Moreover, you don’t have to write the pages of PHP or Apache anymore. Here, you have the flexibility to get everything in one layer that will leave fewer possibilities of bug generation that often arises due to the presence of multiple layers.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Cheap Disk Space </b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">JOIN is mainly used in order to save the storage area in the hard disk by removing fields like state, city and zip code. This prevents creating any unnecessary tables that in turn creates extra space in the hard disk. On the other side of the coin, the JOINs can take up some extra space in your RAM and might not be a good idea at all. Hence, using MongoDB is a necessity as it creates a lot of extra space in the hard drive. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Programming Becomes Easier</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Coding becomes much easier with MEAN stack. You can make use of it on the client’s side as well. This means if you write a code wrongly on Node and then find out that it would have been better using it in Angular JS, then you can easily shift the code. You also do not need to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-php-developers/" target='_blank'>hire a front-end developer or a PHP expert</a> as JavaScript does this all for you. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Node.JS Is Faster</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The event-driven architecture of NodeJS makes it the hero. In this era, where everything is driven digitally, it is important to understand that even the minute detail of an app’s performance matters to them. With Node.JS, you can double the performance of an app. Hence, it comes as an extra benefit in the MEAN stack package.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>A Great Combination Anytime</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While there are many developers who use MongoDB and Apache and sometimes mix it with PHP. On the other hand, there are developers who use NodeJS with MySQL and Angular JS as well, hence it is never a sin to mix and match. There is no fixed rule to use this combination. One is always free to experiment.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>JSON, a Common Factor</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Whether you make use of MongoDB or AngularJS, you can smoothly distribute the data between the layers without rewriting the code again. It also enables you to make use of PHP. You can use the code here to import all the data from MySQL and process it. One interesting thing is that MEAN uses the same format of JSON everywhere. As a result, much time is saved when it comes to reformatting by making the whole process simpler. The icing on the cake is that it enables you to work even with external APIs such as POST, present GET and manipulate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Final Words…</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Most of the developers think that MEAN will overcome LAMP in the years to come, but there is no guarantee to this fact. It is true that over the years LAMP has provided a plethora of benefits as far as web development is concerned, but the introduction of MEAN has taken the whole process of development to an advanced level due to its various benefits. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The large community of Mean Stack is always there for the developers to assist them in solving the hurdles they encounter while developing an application. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Hence, if you want to accelerate your web application development process MEAN stack should be your first preference. It is the bedrock and the ingredient of success behind the effective execution of a flawless web application. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the time the world is experiencing the era of digital transformation, web development has excelled rapidly and has opened the doors of infinite opportunities. Innovation and technology are taking a rapid leap in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and is entering into new realms. When it comes to web application development, a sea change has taken place in the last few years. These changes have given a new ways on developing a web application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby on Rails has always been the first preference when it comes to developing the website in the best possible manner. UIPL has come out with some interesting benefits of this web application framework that will help developers to design a website page easily.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Just The Right One For Web</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just as water can mix itself anywhere irrespective of the size and shape of the container where it is poured in, in the same way, Ruby on Rails is just the perfect match for your website regardless of the type of business where you are involved in. It’s ability to run on a prototype makes it the ultimate option for using in web development. Moreover, one can also fix any kind of issues at the early stages of development.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><b>Cost Effective For You </b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The framework of Ruby on Rails is completely free. You do not have to incur any additional expenditure at all. Being an open source application, it also runs on Linux. Most of the developers, all around the world find it convenient and easier to work with this type of framework. Even if you have migrated either from Microsoft Windows or from ASP, you won’t face any kind of problems.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><b>Saves A Lot Of Time</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a very well-known fact that coding takes a hell lot of time. The complexity in writing the codes in a way that are user-friendly and easy to understand is not only a cumbersome but also a time-consuming process. Developers can move very fast from the planning stage to the development stage very quickly without wasting much time. Hence, in comparison to the other technologies available, <a title="Ruby on Rails" href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> is much beneficial.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><b>Helpful Community </b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you require any kind of assistance or technical advice while making the application, then you can take help from a vast online community. The community comprises of people who have rich experience in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web application development</a>. In addition to this, there are many groups of developers who remain active all the time and are ready to share their ideas as well as experiences in web and app development.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><b>No Delay In Projects</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most frequent problems faced by app development companies is the unnecessary delay in delivering projects. This is caused by the developer who was working on the project and left working on it due to a job change. As a result of which, it becomes impossible to find the where the code began and how did it end. On the other hand, the code needs to be re-written in a fresh way. In order to avoid such kind of problems, Ruby on Rails has been developed. Here, all that the new developer has to do is just follow some simple coding techniques to get a hang of the project.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><b>Make Your Own Applications</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the stunning benefits of Ruby on Rails is that you can create your own plug and play apps. It’s not a cumbersome task to do at all. You can snap your fingers and make your app. This is as simple as that. One can also take elements from the current application and can implement them in developing the new app. Moreover, Ruby on Rails allows you to add more flexibility and make any necessary modifications to them.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><b>The Tag Of The ‘Big Players’</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twitter, Basecamp, Groupon, LivingSocial, name any popular website of the world and you will find one thing common in them – Ruby on Rails. The application is trusted by millions of companies around the world, due to its ability to carry out complex functions smoothly and offer a plethora of services. It is just the perfect tool for anybody who is planning to start his or her own business. As far as superior web development is concerned Ruby on Rails enables you to break free from the traditional way of developing a web platform and create something new and innovative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Step-By-Step Guide For Installing Ruby On Rails </b></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, if you want to install Ruby on Rails, then it is mandatory to install the following software in your system.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>A database system</li>
<li>A web server</li>
<li>Rails Framework</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, there are basically two kinds of operating systems where you can install Ruby on Rails – Windows and Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To install Ruby on Windows, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step-1:</b> Download and install the rubyinstaller-2.2.2.x.exe file</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step–2:</b> Install Rails</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step-3:</b> Check whether you have Rails or not by giving the command C:&gt; rails –v. You will get a message that will read, “<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Congratulations! You are now on Rails over Windows.</span></span></span>” This means Ruby on Rails has been installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To install Ruby on Linux, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step – 1</b>: Install the git-core first. Use yum for installing Rail dependencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step -2:</b> Once done, install rbenv and use the following command</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; echo &#8216;export PATH = &#8220;$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH&#8221;&#8216; &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; echo &#8216;eval &#8220;$(rbenv init -)&#8221;&#8216; &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; exec $SHELL</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; echo &#8216;export PATH = &#8220;$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH&#8221;&#8216; &lt;&lt; ~/.bash_profile</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; exec $SHELL</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step -3:</b> Install Ruby using the command tp&gt; rbenv install -v 2.2.3</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step –4:</b> Now, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-nodejs-developer/">Node.js</a> in your system and then you can install the database</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The easy to install process and the flexibility of use makes Ruby on Rails quite popular for developers. It is emerging to be one of the most popular web development platform mostly among the start ups. Although there are a number of open source programming languages which are available, but Ruby on Rails puts developers on the elite category when it comes to delivering the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">best web development and design project</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Ruby on Rails adventure in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">Unified Infotech</a> broke a few months back. Well, to be precise it took off a year ago. We had the sales team ready and a great business model, but we were missing the developers. Therefore, to launch the technology side of things we started our interview session and collected some of the <strong>best Ruby developers</strong> in the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, what actually is <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>? And why our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>website development company</strong></a> is venturing for the same like other companies? Well, we have our DevOps Engineer <strong>SNG</strong> to speak today on RoR, the recent fascination of Team Unified–</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Now, what’s RoR or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> It is just a framework to build websites to make it more affordable to create and maintain, simultaneously offering improved performance and faster development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>When Unified started Rails sites?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> Well, a year back, we have started building rails sites and ever since that, we have successfully created rails sites for our global clientele.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Why we call RoR as the “bang for bucks”?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> As a business owner you get many advantages from RoR as it help you to build a website without compromising on flexibility and performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Tell, the brief story behind the framework</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> Born in 2003 and fathered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson" target="_blank">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> (DHH), along with a software development firm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basecamp_Classic" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>. The story goes like this &#8211; DHH was fed up with the use PHP and Java and though to give up programming and this frustration gave birth to ruby on Rails. It is an open source framework which gives the building blocks to build very own applications. This framework is a collection of shortcuts written in Ruby to build websites faster.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, Ruby on Rails is not a programming language, but rather a framework to build websites with the combination of languages such as Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It covers both front-end and the back-end. This means it will help you to build a cool web application without having to rely on someone else to build the back-end or the front-end. <strong><em><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/why-is-ruby-on-rails-essential-for-startup-coders-a-detailed-study/">A great thing for the Startups</a>, I must say!</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>A brief technical overview on RoR</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> The Ruby projects implement Model-View-Controller, or MVC. MVC splits up the process to get the information faster to the users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Model</strong> – it holds the data for your web applications such as if you have a list of names and the address you can keep it in the model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>View</strong> – It displays the data on what users sees and usually in the form of HTML templates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Controller</strong> – It is just like the coach, the one who calls for the shot. This gets the data from the model and sends it further ahead for the view. The controller allows editing, deleting and reading the data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If I compare the MVC structure to a shop it may sound like this &#8211; The <strong>model</strong> is the backroom or godown to stock materials. The <strong>view</strong> is the showroom to display the items and the prices. The <strong>controller</strong> is the salesperson or the shop’s employee who responds to the customer request of getting the item from the shelf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>How one can get started with Ruby in Rails</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> In the last few years while installing the Ruby on Rails, we have come across a number of tools called installers. The most popular among them are RailsInstaller or <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">rubyonrails.org</a>. In both the websites, a developer gets the information and desired files to install Ruby on Rails on the computer. You will get your <em>Hello World</em> app running in no time!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Now, tell me the benefits of RoR, which the customer might find interesting</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> For a business owner, <a href="https://unifiedinfotech.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/improve-your-business-agility-with-ruby-on-rails-development-services/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> enables three large benefits –</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Have quicker website launch</strong> – The sites, which conventionally took 12 weeks to develop, can now reach its goal in 6 to 7 weeks with RoR. It is time-saving since it is based on few lines of redundant code, reusing the existing components rather than building the site from scratch and use of available plugins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Enables easier changes</strong> &#8211; After you launch a site, the future modifications to your site can be introduced quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. It is cost-effective</strong> &#8211; Since the speed with which Rails site can be built, so the business owners get to spend less to create the main website without compromising on the quality, performance, and scalability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Which industries can benefit from Ruby on Rails?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> Well, Rails is an ideal solution for industries and verticals such as –</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E-commerce</strong> – The e-commerce sites of today can benefit hugely from the RoR and their user-friendly features and their modular approaches. We also include features that are easily found on the big-level e-commerce sites such as uploads in bulk, updates for products, photos, custom pricing algorithms, on-the-fly photo resizing and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Content Management</strong> &#8211; If you want to build a CMS website to stuff thousands of articles, news, audio files or database-friendly contents, rails cane be a primary solution for you. It allows users with navigate freely with the ease and flexibility to upload and manage the content effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Customized solutions</strong> – Most of our clients seek customized solution as per their business need. They require a novel database to support a new business model. In such cases, we find Rails as the ideal partner to build solutions for them at a fraction of cost and time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What must the developers do to keep Ruby on Rails from sagging?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> Overuse of a technology might die away the interest of the developer to use a technology or framework just as we have enough with PHP and Java, yet they remain the pioneer of the programming world. Similarly, the key philosophy behind Ruby on Rails is not to repeat yourself. Writing code repeatedly is a bad thing, it will be great if you collaborate with other developers for incorporating fresh ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby is able to make assumptions on what you want to do and how. You do not need spend the extra time tweaking every little detail. Ruby comes pre-loaded with out-of-the-box conventions, which help to speed up development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, at the end I can give a quirky tip to all our developer about using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems" target="_blank">Gems</a>, pieces of pre-packaged code that will give you functionality during your development. You do not have to write the code yourself, it’s there done and finished by another talented developer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>In the end…</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a bright conversation on Ruby on Rails over a cup of coffee, it’s time to wrap up. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>Web application development services</strong></a> like Ruby on Rails for quicker progress from the start. Team Unified has analyzed that they can develop a site faster and with more precision, but without spending excessive time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For our developers, Ruby on Rails was great to learn and a breath of fresh air professionally. It is extremely popular among our Startup clients because real-world web applications can be created quickly and easily. However, no one knows the future of programming work, but Ruby is growing strong every day and <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/" target="_blank">Ruby community</a> shows that clearly.</p>

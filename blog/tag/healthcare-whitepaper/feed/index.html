<p id="id_1"><strong>Six of the Most Promising Healthcare Software</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following is an overview of the most popular types of software in the healthcare industry:</span></p>
<p><b>1. </b>Electronic Health Record (EHR) Software<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Just like the CRM of a business maintains customers’ data and interactions, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EHR software is a database for patients’ medical records, medications, invoicing, and payment.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows physicians and patients to collaborate and create health plans on the EHR software and keep a track of the treatment progress.</span></p>
<p><b>According to recent research, the global EHR/EMR market will be worth $38 billion USD by 2025. (Source: </b><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2409/digital-health/"><b>Statista</b></a><b>)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">two most popular types of Electronic Health Records Software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Electronic patient record software (EPR)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; This is a database for patients’ medical records from history, treatments to the recovery process.</span></li>
<li>Electronic medical records software (EMR)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; EMR keeps a track of information like medicines prescribed, their dosages, diagnoses, and medical procedures.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. </b>Hospital Management System Software (HMS)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The HMS is a business tool that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automates all the day-to-day functions of a hospital like scheduling appointments, bed management, hospital inventory, claims, complaint handling, and more.</span></p>
<p><b>3. </b>Medical Billing Software (MBS)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; As the name suggests, the accounting department uses this software to keep a record of patients’ medical and hospital bills. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This online medical billing software provides a complete end-to-end solution to track all invoices, payments, and medical insurance. </span></p>
<p><b>4. </b>Medical Imaging Software (MIS)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hospitals and clinics need imaging software to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">visualize the results from CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Additionally, a medical imaging software </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">creates 2-D and 3-D images of the human body</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and organs. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D medical image processing software </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is used in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">printing implants and medical equipment to plan surgeries and treatments.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It helps to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">detect diseases at the initial stage, identify the prognosis and take preventive measures.</span></p>
<p><b>5. </b>Medical Diagnosis Software (MDS)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Diagnosing diseases and sharing inputs from various medical practitioners manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. AI technology is developing rapidly and it has not left the healthcare field untouched. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI-powered diagnosis software </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerated the treatment process with the detection of symptoms and timely diagnosis of diseases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This software helps to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer information between departments easily and add data to patients’ cards. Although these reports are accessible to doctors in the hospital, the software maintains the anonymity of patients’ accounts.</span></p>
<p><b>6. </b>E-prescribing Software (EPS)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gone are the days of trying to make sense of your doctor’s handwriting in prescriptions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of this AI-powered software solution, your doctor can directly connect with your local pharmacy. This speeds up the process of taking medications and eliminates human errors. With just a couple of clicks, you can extend, change or cancel your prescription at any time.</span></p>
<p id="id_2"><strong>Reasons Why You Need Digital Healthcare Software</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might think that the medical industry was doing just fine without </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/healthcare-application-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthcare software solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, it is very likely that if you digitally transform your practice, your work would be more organized, efficient, and completely patient-centric</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tasks like recording, manually looking up a patient&#8217;s history, invoicing and billing, all are time-consuming and they add up.</span></p>

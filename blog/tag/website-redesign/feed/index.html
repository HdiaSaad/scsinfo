										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The redesign operations for any site starts with a lot of planning and strategizing. But more often than not, these practices do not bring in expected results. What might be the reason for that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main problem is the fact that most of the time clients come in with the idea that web design and web redesign are the same processes. The familiarity with one assures them of familiarity with another process, and that produces problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a sharp variation within </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign challenge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and normal design challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both procedures are very contrasting from the inside. And that’s why I with my team have created this guide that intends to clear out the confusion and provide an in-depth understanding of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to redesign a website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Stock Of Your Website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the thing about</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> redesigning your website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;  it starts with an already existing and functional site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not a ‘build-from-the-scratch’ mission, rather ‘fix-the-problematic-area’ mission. And to do it right, the site has to be inspected first. And that’s why this is the first step of this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign guide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll find plenty of issues when inspecting the site. These areas undoubtedly need to be fixed. Now based on the website, you’ll find various issues. </span></p>
<p>During my experience in running a <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">web design company in Casablanca</a>, I have gathered information that can help you make the decision the right way.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of some basic complications that happen to every site. </span></p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> There are plenty of good analytics tools out there like Google Analytics,  Google Pagespeed Insights, GTmatrix, etc. Use these to get a full idea of the state of the website.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Lack Of Parallelity </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business has a unique identity. And the design needs to reflect it seamlessly. A lot of business owners looking for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">affordable website design</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forget to count in the matter of business identity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then disaster ensues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though initially your site matched with business identity, later on, it might not. The identity of the business can change as it grows, and the site design needs to change accordingly as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So take a look at the site and consider if it matches the business identity. If it doesn’t, then it is time to change it. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Where Are The Results?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of reasons for a business to have a site. From escalating revenue generation to getting traffics. But at the end of the day, only one goal matters, and that is- to make the business more successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when analyzing the old website, ask if the website bringing in the kind of result expected? If not, then put the site through inspection and pinpoint the problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be an important part of the entire </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign strategy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. The Relevancy Of The Design</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web design is evolving every day. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">modern website design trends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change regularly, and most successful ones out there are keeping up without any problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the site was designed in early 2010 and carrying the same design since then, it’s high time for a redesign. Backdated designs cause both aesthetic issues and technical issues, rendering the site unusable. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Issue With Engagement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good website is always appealing to its users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When considering a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think about whether the website is attracting the users. Inspect the web content, images, information structure of the website. If it is failing to engage and excite the visitors, then it is time to change it all.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. The Bounce Rate Dilemma </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This issue puts a lot of sites in jeopardy. The more people leave as soon as they enter the site, the bigger problem will be.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There can be plenty of reasons for users to desert the site. These reasons can range from misleading page content to slow website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever it might be, the website analysis stage can determine these reasons and help in finding solutions. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outline The Website Redesign You Want</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website redesign</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fixes the problems of the site as well as adds more elements to it. This is the time to consider the ingredients that make a perfect site is like and include those elements on the website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process won’t work without a clear action plan. After acquiring the basic idea of what needs to be changed, go on and list out what needs to be added to the websites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The requirements might be different based on the type of trade. but the basic requirements for a successful website remain the same. And if the website is lacking any of these, then add it to the list of requirements ASAP.</span></p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For the <span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, conduct a market and competitor inspection. Analyze the prosperous websites in the industry, and compare that to the website. Find out what is lacking, and add those requirements to the list.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Well Planned Page Architecture</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every page needs to follow an architectural pattern necessary to help site visitors find the right information. This architecture is based on a lot of research and visitor behavior on the page. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12438" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12438" style="width: 987px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-12438 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low-fidelity-wireframe@1.5x.jpg" alt="website architecture " width="987" height="852" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low-fidelity-wireframe@1.5x.jpg 987w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low-fidelity-wireframe@1.5x-300x259.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low-fidelity-wireframe@1.5x-768x663.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12438" class="wp-caption-text">Low Fidelity wireframing</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this matter is going to be the best way to proceed. With proper help, it will be easier to understand how the demographic has changed and what kind of IA they prefer on web pages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The structure of the information on the page can always be improved for better results.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Website Navigation: The Smoother The Better</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This element is important to provide users with a clear way of finding information on the site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Done perfectly, it also assists the site to perform well among the search results. It works with the user intuition to provide them with a streamlined path to information on the site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s always room for improvement, and even if the website has a functional navigational flow, it can be improved upon. While analyzing, compare the entire flow of wayfinding on the site with other sites in the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comparison will help to understand what is lacking in the site’s navigation. This is going to be a much-needed addition to your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/website-redesign-tips/">redesign strategy</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Does Your Website Have The Client’s Trust?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No business functions without having their client’s trust. And when it comes to earning the trust of the clients, content is a key player. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12439" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12439" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12439 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clients-trust-1024x384.jpg" alt="client testimonial in website redesign" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clients-trust-1024x384.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clients-trust-300x112.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clients-trust-768x288.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clients-trust.jpg 1182w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12439" class="wp-caption-text">Example of portraying client&#8217;s trust</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The content of the website assists in convincing the people about the quality and authenticity of the work. The redesign is going to be the perfect time to do a content analysis, and then change them up to gain the client’s trust. Good quality content is necessary for earning the client’s trust in business. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Conversion funnel (including placements of CTAs)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every site exists to alter visitors into clients. There is a clear flow of path to this transformation and it is visualized as a funnel, and hence why the name Conversion funnel.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12423" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12423" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12423 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/conversion-funnel.png" alt="website redesign funnel" width="512" height="396" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/conversion-funnel.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/conversion-funnel-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12423" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Crazyegg.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are four steps to this- awareness, interest, design, and action. It is an automated system designed to attract and transform potential clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no need for any manual action if the site already consists of a clear path of transformation for clients. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> process is the perfect time to understand how to integrate this automated system to get, maximum clients. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Action Stage</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing changes without action. Even the previous two steps, necessary for the redesign would not work if the right actions are not taken. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of times problems appear at this stage due to the lack of knowledge on how to proceed through this project. </span></p>
<p>Here is a list of actions you need to take in order to ensure that the redesign process becomes successful.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Choosing The Right Team to Plan Your Website Redesign</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having the right team for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesigning process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is absolutely crucial. Whether it is an in house designers and developers, of hiring an agency, the team needs to have the right players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">professional website designers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other professionals needed for the entire project-</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Digital strategist:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is the member of the team who will define the whole strategy to transform visitors for the redesigned site. </span></li>
<li><b>Information architect:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the team member who will build the right structure to present information to the end-user as well as build an overall structure to help the user find the way through the website.</span></li>
<li><b>UX designer:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this person will take all the input from the above-mentioned people and then create a site that is designed for maximum levels of efficiency on the website. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of clients come in thinking that only a designer is needed for the redesign. The fact remains that it is the very last task. The above team members will conduct crucial tasks, such as market analysis, brand study, etc. The designer will build based on this research. </span></p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Even if a <span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign agency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> claims to include professionals, do not believe them. Check out the portfolio and client review of that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">agency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prior to making any decisions on hiring.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Aim High With Proper Planning for Website Redesign</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every site is built with different objectives in mind that are subjected to change over time. And the site needs to reflect this change perfectly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the redesign process, it is necessary to evaluate the previous goals and then change them when necessary. The changes occur depending on client demographic, changing industry scenarios, and the size of the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s crucial to consult </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">local website designer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before redefining the objectives and diving deeper into the process. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. A Fictional Persona To Understand The Requirments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the goals are set, it’s time for you and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’ve hired to think and imagine a client persona. This is essential for understanding the demographic, its needs, and how to best cater to it. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12440" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12440" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12440 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-persona@2x-1024x710.jpg" alt="website redesign" width="1024" height="710" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-persona@2x-1024x710.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-persona@2x-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-persona@2x-768x533.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-persona@2x.jpg 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12440" class="wp-caption-text">Defining the user persona</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of information required for this step-</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Age </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasons for accessing the internet</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How they access the internet</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What devices are used </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behavior on the internet (including the type of websites they search for, the kind of things they buy, etc)</span></li>
<li>Their needs, frustration, and motivation</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This stage assists with redesigning the site interface. This ensures a memorable encounter with the site for the visitors and makes them come back again and again. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Time To Finalize The Product</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final step is the culmination of all the research and tasks you’ve done till now. All the results and statistics collected go into the design phase, which can be divided into a few steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design phase is divided into four parts. And sure these often overlap but having clear and precise knowledge can ensure that the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ends successfully. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Wireframe creation</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first stage. It is when the skeleton frame of the site is built, depending on the information on IA, navigations best practices, etc.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Content creation</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the wireframing is done, comes the content creation stage. This stage is based heavily on the research and analysis data from previous stages. All content is aimed at impressing and gaining the trust of the visitors. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Designing the UI</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this stage, the interface of the site is revamped. Using the research information and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">modern website design trends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the site interface is updated, then handed over to the developers for development.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Development</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the last point. Once the site is finalized through coding and programming, it goes in for a final check for bugs and other problems. Once these are smoothened out, the site can go live for the users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s about it, the entire procedure of reconstructing the design. But before concluding, here is an extra advice section- the errors to dodge during this process.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mistakes To Avoid At All Costs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> redesigning your website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there are a few errors that can be extremely harmful. Keep an eye open throughout the procedure so that none of these errors happen to the site.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Not Testing The Website Before Launch</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not testing the site before launching is a grave error to make. Once the site is done developing, put it through the testing procedure in order to determine that it reaches all the necessary goals. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Not Integrating A Sitemap</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sitemap of a site helps the bots to scan it. It is important to improve the navigation of the site, as well as for improving site rankings. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Spending Budget Yet Unnecessary Integrations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ordinary misconception about the entire operation often leads the clientele to blow the budget over unnecessary integrations on the site believing that it is going to help it to be successful. However, this only increases the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">web redesign cost</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and produces problems. So frame the budget carefully before starting the operation.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping Up</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different kinds of clients perceive web redesign in different ways. Some consider it to be incredibly daunting, while some think of it in a lightweight manner. No matter what, the right moves in redesign operation is crucial for the success of the site.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you’ve just launched a brand new website for your business and expecting loads of online clients. All in all, you’re very excited!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even after enough time, there is no business from your website. There are no clients coming in, and the bounce rate is sky-high even after trying out all the web page tricks. And you kind of feel like a kid being handed socks as presents on Christmas morning…</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/l41YzNlhKqyJqQZG0" width="298" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, before you compile the best in class strategists to find out where you went wrong with the website strategy, hear us out&#8212; it’s probably the design that crushed all your dreams of getting high numbers of clients from the website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might seem fake, but it’s true. When browsing for any product, most site visitors are going to check out the design of your website before they check the content to determine if your product is credible enough. If you can’t impress them with the design then forget about impressing them with the content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what should you do in this situation? Well, the most obvious solution is the website redesign. Partially or completely overhauling the website design to make it user-friendly can go a long way to ensure the success of the website. Now if you are thinking about how to redesign a website, then you’re at the right place, cause we are going to tell you about all the steps you need to follow to redesign your website for better.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Steps To Be Taken: For The Redesigning Of Your Website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we dive into the details on how to redesign your website to answer all your web redesign questions, let’s have a quick look at all the steps you need to take to redesign your website-</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have the web redesign checklist, let’s go through them and see what they entail.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step By Step Process Of Redesigning Your Personal Website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of redesigning your personal website is pretty simple. It’s all about recognizing the problem areas of the design of your website and then designing them again to match the requirements of your business. </span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eTpesGfqObU" width="727" height="409" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, before you hire website redesign services, you have to understand the steps, and below, we have discussed each of them in detail. </span></p>
<h2 id="Analyze_your_old_website_design"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Before Changing The Old, Let’s Analyze It</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you begin the website redesign process, stop and look at the already established design you have on your website. This will help you to design the website design strategy template to draw up the web redesign proposal. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11556 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Polaroid_Website.png" alt="analyzing before you find out how to redesign a website" width="610" height="555" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Polaroid_Website.png 610w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Polaroid_Website-300x273.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important for you to analyze the old design because you have to circle out the flaws of the old design to change them. Redesigning the website without analyzing the old design will only create more problems. Before understanding the website redesign requirements, you have to understand why you need redesign in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are asking why to redesign a website, then you need to analyze the old design of the text. Pretty sure you will find many reasons to redesign your website Here are a few of those reasons-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: The Design Is Ages Old</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first reason why you would need to redesign your website is the age of the design. We all know that fine wine is something that ages well, sadly it is not the same when it comes to website design. The design of a website needs to be updated with time, adapting to the latest design trends and techniques. Failing to do so will make your website look positively medieval, and that is not going to be appealing to the website visitors. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B: Designing Better UX</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second reason why you might have to redesign your website is to give the users a better UX. if the UX of the website is not up to par, you might receive complaints, or maybe have the bounce rate speak on behalf of the users. In any case, designing a better UX can be one of the main reasons why you might find yourself having to go through the web revamp process. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C: Integration Of Latest Tools</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology is advancing by the minutes. And that’s why we have more tools available for website designing today than we had last year. And it goes without saying that to leverage the best of these tools, you have to redesign your website to match their technical requirements. </span></p>
<h2 id="Find_ELTWO"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Finding ELTWO: Elements That Work</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because your website needs redesigning, does not mean everything needs to be changed. In fact, you will find that many aspects of your website work perfectly fine. And if they do work fine, then there’s no need for any web design changes. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11557 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-process-landing-page-concept.jpg" alt="elements that work in website redesign" width="626" height="626" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-process-landing-page-concept.jpg 626w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-process-landing-page-concept-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-process-landing-page-concept-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">These elements can include the logo, images, typography, or the colors used on the website, anything. When analyzing the old design of your website, if you happen to find any elements of the design that works perfectly fine, you should integrate them into your website seamlessly. </span></p>
<h2 id="Make_proper_use_of_your_user_data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Make Use Of The User Data</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the user from the very beginning of the website design process should’ve been a priority for you. But if you failed to apply it, then no worries, you can do it during the redesign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will collect plenty of data throughout the operation period to analyze and learn what exactly went wrong with the design of your website in the first place. This user data will answer all your questions about where the users got stuck while navigating the page, where they got exhausted and left the page altogether. It will help you recognize all the snags in the design and smooth it out. </span></p>
<h2 id="Build_your_idea_wireframes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Build Wireframes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How about before you redesign and launch it, you build an interactive MVP or wireframe, and have it tested?</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11558" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11558" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11558 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Toonyport-Wireframe@1.5x.png" alt="website redesign tips" width="1600" height="865" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Toonyport-Wireframe@1.5x.png 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Toonyport-Wireframe@1.5x-300x162.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Toonyport-Wireframe@1.5x-768x415.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Toonyport-Wireframe@1.5x-1024x554.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11558" class="wp-caption-text">Web design wireframe idealized by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will help you to have built a wireframe first and have it tested before actually implementing the design. You can collect data on how hard or easy it was for the users to navigate through the entire design, the points they got stuck on and the navigational points they were confused about. Creating a wireframe before redesigning is going to only enhance the benefits of the redesign process. </span></p>
<h2 id="List_the_elements_that_need_a_redesign"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. List The Elements That Need Redesign</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we come to the most important part- the design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, when talking about website redesign we can not skip over the part of the design. There are many elements of designing you have to take care of while redesigning. Below are a few of them.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Make It Responsive</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first design element you have to consider is the responsiveness of the website. You need to keep in mind that today most people will be using their phones to access your website. And in order to accommodate them, you have to make sure that your website is responsive. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11559 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/responsive-web-design-devices.jpg" alt="how to redesign a website and make it responsive" width="626" height="626" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/responsive-web-design-devices.jpg 626w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/responsive-web-design-devices-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/responsive-web-design-devices-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, it doesn’t take a lot of effort to turn your website into a responsive website and helps a lot to impress and convert clients. So if your website is not already mobile-friendly, then make sure that it is during the redesign phase. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B: Using Proper Images And Illustrations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have briefly talked about the importance of visual design, but for this point, we have to talk about it in detail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The visual impact of the website design is more important than you think. Apparently, </span>46.1% of visitors<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a website decide on the credibility of the website after looking at the design. This is why to make the most of the visual impact, you have to use authentic images and illustrations that are relevant to your product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is an easier and perhaps even cheaper solution to use stock images and illustrations you might find online. But, they are not going to help with the credibility of the website. Even though these photographs are of high quality, they still seem fake, and you can not increase consumer trust in your brand with fake images. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11560 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/use-of-proper-images.png" alt="how to redesign a website and not ruin it" width="512" height="242" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/use-of-proper-images.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/use-of-proper-images-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of authentic images will help users to build up trust in you. So, conduct a photoshoot, or have your hired designers from website redesigning company design up some original and unique illustrations. Sure it might be a little costly and time consuming, but the positive effect of it will be worth it. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C: Branding Through Colors And Logo</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When analyzing your previous design, make sure to check if the entire aesthetic of the website, including texts and typography, colors and logo are matching your brand value. Is it how you want your business to be known? If not, then you have to opt for a complete redesign for your website to reflect the brand of your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the many aspects that’ll affect the brand image of your website are color and logo. In the long haul, users are going to remember you by the colors you used and the logo of your business. For maximum effect, you have to place the logo on the top left corner of the page. That is where the user is going to look first to find the logo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzing the famous brands in the market will help us better understand the importance of color in branding. Think of Facebook, what color do you see? Is it blue? That’s because from the beginning facebook has used the color blue to present themselves as a calm, secure and steadfast social media platform. The color of your website should reflect the nature of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When rebranding becomes necessary during redesigning, ensure that the color you choose for your brand reflects the value of what your business does, along with invoking a positive emotion among them. This simple decision will go a long way to make your brand a world-famous one. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D: Adding Landing Pages</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the conversion is one of the main website redesign objectives for your website, then you have to make sure to create new landing pages. The landing pages are going to be focused on converting the site visitors through discounts, offers, or email subscriptions list. The conversion rate of your website is definitely going to rise with the right landing pages. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11565 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/contact-us-concept-landing-page_52683-22797.jpg" alt="website's contact us concept landing page" width="626" height="417" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/contact-us-concept-landing-page_52683-22797.jpg 626w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/contact-us-concept-landing-page_52683-22797-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have the proper landing pages in place, analyze the user response to them. When you run website optimization reports, you will get a whole lot of insight into how the user is reacting to the page you have designed. And based on that insight and web page design ideas and tips you can later change the design to match their requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above-mentioned points can be a little overwhelming, but that does not mean it’s impossible to achieve the perfect redesign. Don’t believe us? Well, let us tell you all about the web redesign best practices we follow at Unified Infotech. And once we are done, you have to believe us when we say, website redesign might seem daunting, but it is easy as well. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Practices That We Follow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To deliver the best product in the market, you have to follow some best practices in the market. And throughout the years we have gathered enough experience to create a list of best practices we follow like the sacred texts. What are these best practices you ask? Well, let’s see-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: We Know The Secret Language Of Design</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing a website is all about earning the trust of the user through the psychological influences of the design principles. And when it comes to following the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">web design principles popular in Casablanca and other areas</a>, no one can do it better than us. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11561" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11561 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-principles.jpg" alt="web design principles" width="512" height="314" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-principles.jpg 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-principles-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11561" class="wp-caption-text">Source: interaction-design.org</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We make sure to follow all of the important design principles, whether we are talking about the rule of the third or the proper use of negative space. We focus on design principles that bring on maximum conversion for your business. At the end of the day, the design is not just a matter of aesthetics, it is a matter of fulfilling your website revamp objectives. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B: We Can Help The Users To Find Their Way: On Your Website</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we talk about navigation, we don’t mean navigation of a ship, but the navigation of a website. We make sure that the navigational flow from pages to pages on the website is smooth and without any hitches so that users can go from point A to point B on the website without any problems. We strive to make the navigation of the website so easy that the user feels like an expert sailor, of the internet. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C: No More Confusion For The Users When Making Choices</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting the users with so many options will only make them confused and dazed. And that’s why we follow the Hick-Hyman Law. According to the law, narrowing down the choices presented to the user to the very basic and necessary few will help them to take action. Being too confused with numerous choices will only annoy them and they will eventually leave. And that’s why we make it easier for the users to make their choices. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D: How Fast The Website Needs To Be?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one has the time for slow loading web pages. Any page that takes more than 2 seconds to display any kind of information will be abandoned by the user in a heartbeat. And that’s why our web redesign best practices include making the website a fast loading one so that the user doesn’t have to wait to begin their journey with you. </span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/DDe8RfqPKEgiA" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways of making the website faster, including compressing images, caching the static data and many more. And we follow all of them to make your website load faster than any other website on the internet.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E: How Important Is It To Go Social On Your Website?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting social is very important today, especially if you want more sales and customers. And that’s why we made sure to integrate social media integration as a part of our web design best practice. Whether it is sharing your website blog through social media or being a part of your social media journey, we help the users to connect to you on a social level so that the connection only gets deeper with time. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel as if your website is not working, then there’s no reason to get disheartened. Through a redesign, you can not only change the complete look of your website but also turn it into a lead generation machine.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As per Hubspot, the bounce rate of a website increases due to two factors – users are unable to find the right information they look for and the web page was very complicated when it came to using it. The market of <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>website redesign in Casablanca, USA</strong></a> is changing today. A well-designed website rests on a number of factors like research about the customers, rebranding and implementing the research insight in the website for successful implementation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Website Redesign – The Necessity </strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tradition of using Flash to make an attractive website has long been out of the trend. A dull looking website drives away all the traffic and most importantly fails to connect with the customers. Users always look for more engaging things that bring out the best and let them feel more special. Website redesign in USA has gone a level up by offering its targeted customers a redesigned website with a completely new appearance and a fresh new look. The online world is today replete with a number of websites along with appealing designs. To stand out among them requires a strong USP. If you have that,as a businessman, then it’s good, or else there is one more way out – Website redesign.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A great website redesign constitutes taking care of all aspects present in your website. The primary task here is not only concerned with changing the designing elements, rather it also includes changing the non-designing elements as well. For instance: changing the navigational structure, coding and other technical aspects of a page. Making such changes can bring direct results for your company and ensure guaranteed positive changes in the company’s growth. This is one aspect of a business, which always brings success. So, the next time you go for a redesign, you must know that it is not one but multiple aspects taken together to change a website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the question “Should I go for a website redesign?” is still making rounds around your head, then we must say that you will reap the following benefits if you go for one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Create a mobile friendly website</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Give a more professional look</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Break the monotonous design from a user’s perspective</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Score over the call-to-action words</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Live up to the expectations of the customers</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, by now you must have realized about the necessity of website redesign in today’s world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Boosting Website Traffic With a Great Redesign</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Redesigning your website can really fetch some very good results. If you apply them in the correct way, then it is time to brush up your redesigning skills and start getting the maximum leads for your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But how will you do it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t worry as a company that deals in website redesign in USA, we are here to give you a complete solution on how will you utilize your skills to redesign a website and get the maximum website visitors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Keep An Eye Over Analytics</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Analyze the current behavior of your target customers. Once you have analyzed it, then keep a record of it. This will include the number of visitors in your website, bounce rate, time spent on the website, domain authority, a number of leads and the total sales generated. The best way to do it is by keeping a Google Analytics account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Overcome Difficulties With Assets</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Redesigning a web page comes with a hefty price if you have not taken any backup previously. Your current website consists of many assets. By ‘assets,’ we mean the most shared content, the page with the maximum traffic and the number of inbound links. So, before redesigning a web page, always keep a backup of all your data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Design For the Target Audience</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Believe it or not! If you are not successful in making a website interesting to the users, they will abandon the website immediately. It is, therefore, necessary to speak them in their language. Study closely about their tastes and preferences and know the thing they like the best. You can then accordingly make the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Optimize Your Website</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can call this as the golden rule. Yes, optimizing your website can bring all those loose ends together and make it a better one in terms of visibility in the search engine. You can do this by keeping an account of your most researched page, creating a 301 redirecting strategy and know your shortcomings. Remember, that every page requires a keyword to drive more visitors. Take advantage of SEO and optimize your header and footer tags.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Make a Great Content Strategy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A great content on a website is the key towards getting more customers. Fresh content with relevant keywords not only brings more traffic to the website, in fact, it also generates more leads. You can start with a blog with relevant information about the current industry trends or any other updates. Write press releases of your products giving more information about your products and services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Target Your Audience Well</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No marketing is possible without the right knowledge of the customer base. As a businessman, it is mandatory for you to know about the likes and dislikes of your customers. Once you are aware of your preferences, you can easily understand what do they expect from you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Tracking The Changes After Redesign</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Merely implementing the changes doesn’t suffice. You need to measure its effects as well. Factors like bounce rate matter a lot. Website redesign in USA will not be successful until and unless you measure its efficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Benchmark Your Performance</strong>: You can evaluate the current performance of the website in three ways – goal conversion rate, bounce rate and page visit per session. You can track the goal conversion rates with Google analytics. At the same time, it also shows the percentage of bounce rate. Pages per session time will help you to determine the average time spent by the user on your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Keep A Track On Traffic Quality</strong>: Now that you have got a new appearance for your website, it is very important that you keep a constant watch on the traffic movement. Keep a watch to assess whether website redesign has doubled or not as compared with the previous designs. This will give you a fair idea about the impact of adding or deleting a particular element from a website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Generate A Report</strong>: With the help of Google Analytics, you can prepare a report and maintain it throughout the year to compare the performance of your website right after the website redesign in USA. It is a very easy process to keep on evaluating your website’s performance and improve it subsequently. No need to rely on any external sources, these tools will help you to constantly monitor the performance.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap Up</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the change in preferences of customers, there is an increasing need of website redesign in USA today. As a marketer, it is your responsibility to live up to their expectations. One of the ways to do is by redesigning your website if needed. However, it is always recommended that you always take a backup first before going for a redesign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">With the festive season approaching near, the excitement level has reached its crescendo. People are now waiting for the D-day of celebration as a number of occasions comes ahead in the next few weeks, starting with the Thanksgiving Day, followed subsequently with bigger celebrations like Cyber Monday, Black Friday, Christmas and New Year. With most of the retailers going online with their business, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>website redesign</strong></a> is a game-changing factor for them, who want to revamp the structure and design of his or her website, this holiday season.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Holiday Season And Buying Behaviour</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The PwC 2016 Holiday Outlook report, estimates that holiday spending in the US is going to increase by 10% in 2016 as compared to the previous year. Moreover, the positive aspect is that there will be a 25% increase in digital sales, which is a great news for online retailers. Shoppers will spend an average amount of $1,121 on per head basis. Hence, these strong statistics strongly suggest that there will be a blast in the selling carts and retailers will reap away the maximum profits from this year’s holiday season sale. Faster checkout options, affordable prices, and well-stocked stores are the three characteristics which are going to rule the shopping industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As global borders continue to blur in online shopping, there has been a wide acceptance of mobile commerce all over the world. The increasing usage of mobile phone hence acts as a contributing factor to the massive holiday sales this year. Brands are available today within a tap on the mobile screen and consumers are eager to get an instant delivery of their desired product. Independent retailers and local businessmen have a great opportunity to tap potential customers from the market. With mobile phone usage at a rapid rate, it will be become easier for marketers to understand the consumer&#8217;s behavior. At the same time, they can also imply the right marketing strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Website Redesign is an important area that always remains on top of the website checklist especially during holiday season. This part of the year is perhaps the best ever time when one can utilize all the resources and implement them to earn the maximum revenue. A clever website redesign combined with the right marketing strategy will lay out the perfect revenue-earning path. After reading this blog, you will be more confident and take the right decision when it comes to redesigning your website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>So, Is Your Website Ready For The Holiday Season?</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make your website ready for the upcoming holiday season, it is necessary to go for a redesign. However, you must ask yourselves to ask some questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Are The CTAs And Buy Buttons Effective?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want visitors who keep on hopping from one website to the other get stuck to your website, then the only way to do it is by designing effective call-to-action buttons that converts the visitors in to full time customers. For instance: just below the purchasing item, you can keep a number of options like warranty options apart from the ‘Add to cart’ option. An ‘add to wish list’ item is yet another interesting way to keep customers stay at your website for a longer time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Can Your Website Handle Multiple Visitors? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you go for a website redesign or any other development feature, always ask yourself, can your website handle multiple visitors? Holiday season is the peak time when you will witness a flood of visitors. Well, if you think that your website is not capable enough, fret not. Either go for shared hosting or a dedicated hosting. While you might have heard about these two kinds of hosting, however, Colocated hosting is yet another kind of hosting which can ease your task. Here, the company purchases server in its own name and has the host facility with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do You Want To Go For Redesign?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have been experiencing a slump in the number of visitors in your website, then it is the time that you go for a website redesign immediately. This is perhaps the best time to rebrand your business. Make changes in the navigation structure of the website and its URLs to help the customers get a new look for your website rather than experiencing the same bored look. You can also implement a 301 redirect plan. In addition to this, one can also change the fonts. Add a festive touch to the fonts to have a maximum impact on the visitors.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Jazz Up Your Website With These Amazing Holiday Tips</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use a pop up on the home page of your website with a nice animation. This could also be a gif.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Write a holiday special blog post.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Send holiday special coupons to customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spread the word in social media regarding any new deals or offers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep in touch with last year’s buyers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Showcase the holiday special products in your home page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Highlight the sign up portion of email.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Introduce customers to new brands.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap Up!</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no better time, other than the holiday season to improve your bottom line. Website redesign acts as a catalyst to keep the profits consistent through the year. Keep in mind that your website is bound to get busier during the holiday season, hence it should be redesigned in such a way that it attracts the maximum traffic to the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Customers always look for something unique and interesting. You cannot let them down especially during the holiday season. Understanding the customer psyche and turning them into real time customers is the key to making your e-commerce website ready.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">You face many serious product-level issues when you ignore publishing, re-configuration, or customization of your CMS. Collectively these issues push your company’s ability as not to use your website as a weapon for the marketplace. That is depressing, isn’t it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, it tells that your website needs a revamp or rather a redesign. Previously, in our web 2.0 blog we have been discussing testing ideas to determine whether websites need a redesign, and now we would clarify doubts of <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/web-design-trends-2019-for-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank">website owners on redesigning</a>. We thought to share some self-assessment signs that would help owners to determine on the change of website design.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Do You Have Separate Publishing Tools for Website and Mobile? – Pretty Confusing</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, having two channels are a confusing concept and errors have to occur. On the other hand, when you use a contemporary CMS, it manages multiple publishing channels. Enter the content once and publish to your intended channels, this gives your content omnipresence.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Having So Many Variations of a Single Image &#8211; Its Tedious</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a tedious task to spread a source image in your target areas in various sizes. You need to do much of cropping and resize. Moreover, have to verify the input, whether the dimensions are correct or not and assign the correct image variant to the appropriate target. Gosh, it is a time-consuming task.<br />
With CMS website redesigning, you are going to get a contemporary CMS that creates variants on the fly. Simply point the source image to the multiple target areas and leave the rest upon image engine.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>What Time You Take to Publish Breaking News, 15 Or 20 Minutes – Time-Taking</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gathering copy, images, creating or selecting tags, previewing them in multiple channels is a long 8-step process…. PHEW! Will you like to embrace such a long step to launch a breaking news?<br />
Get ahead choose contemporary CMS that comes with highly flexible UI for editors. This UI editor would allow you to arrange the content faster into one authoring environment.<br />
<strong>This featured UI would offer – </strong></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>A layout editor</li>
<li>DAM comes with an image-view in thumbnail form</li>
<li>Can add or delete a list of components from the page</li>
<li>A tag manager for all into one-screen view</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Is the CMS Code Hiding from You? – Makes thing Difficult</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That is surely going to make de-bugging difficult for you. Since, you are unable to access the code it becomes difficult to find and fix issues. Worse can happen, you have to request a quote to the CMS vendor or a partner if you want to customize your CMS. Since, many vendors do not transfer development or extension straight away to their customers.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Do You Need to Re-Negotiate Licensing With Your CMS Vendor For a New Project – Poor Choice of Vendor</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A vital part of the marketing is spin-up new projects. If your license terms dictates you to notify vendors for every new project and incurs additional fees, then it is your time to change. Most vendors in the marketplace are moving towards fluid licensing model that allow organizations to add domains without getting prior approval of the vendor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>WRAP UP</b><br />
Hope you are not facing face this concise list of pain points or hope not your CMS vendor is incurring undue expenses. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank">If so the opt for a professional CMS web development</a>.<br />
Wait, make sure that the new CMS addresses the blockers and gives a boost to your publishing and development pace. Never concentrate of a long wish list or a POC that you might get in an Apache project, not in CMS. Since, a CMS never fulfills out-of-the-box needs. It would meet most of your needs, but that customization largely depends on the developer.</p>

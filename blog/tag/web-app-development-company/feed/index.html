										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The principle reason behind creating HTML5 was to synchronize all mobile applications in various platforms. You might get some similarity of this Hyper Text Markup Language with Adobe Flash as both these applications enable you to play both audio and video. The only difference between the two lies in the usage of components such as JavaScript and CSS3. The evolution of the language in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>web app development in USA</strong></a> started from 2012 when the World Wide Web Consortium started to lay more focus on creating a single standard application.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What Makes HTML5 Special?</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With each version of HTML, it is getting better. It is no doubt that even the fifth version is going to surprise the developers. In the latest version, three new features namely audio, canvas and video empower and increase the capability of the language. Powered by these features, HTML5 has increased its capability to play both audio and video. The other notable features are the scalable vector graphics and MathML. They support the mathematical formulas. To make it easier for the end user, six more elements have come in this version; they are an article, section, header, nav, aside and footer. They enrich the semantic contents present in the document.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other side, there are many input elements, which are still present. It is a well-known fact that menu and cite option have been a part of HTML. They are still present in the new version with subtle changes. However, there is some syntax which doesn’t exist anymore are the centre, frame, and font. CSS has replaced them with improved capabilities. One good news is that API and DOM are now an important part of HTML5. This is one markup language, which will work on all platforms and is one of most anticipated technologies, which the web app development in USA has been waiting for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to applicability, 153 out of 500 Fortune 500 companies use HTML5 as a programming language. Using the language has helped them to reap profits of about $4.2 trillion, which is almost 34.4% of the total revenue earned by the companies in one financial year. When it comes to industry-specific usage of the language, the materials and glass industry lead the league followed by computer software, entertainment and communication industry. Well, one important reason why web app development in USA companies flock to HTML5 is that it can easily process data like data and images.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>HTML5 Mistakes Developers Make With Solutions</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless of the kind of application, there are some most common mistakes, which an HTML developer might make while executing it. We, as a leading company of web app development in USA are here to make you aware of those flaws along with the solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, take a look at the five most common HTML5 mistakes and how to avoid them easily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Relying on Local Storage<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the internet came to usage for the first time, one could find small data left by web applications on the computer. For instance: user data, locally shared objects and browser data from Microsoft were something, which was far behind the normal data sharing process. Depending on local storage was an impediment definitely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Solution</strong>: Do not ever store security on a local storage disk. Doing this leaves the possibility of the data to be vulnerable to third party access. At least, it is the best solution instead of using cookies. One can store session storage and local storage values at any time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Working With Compatible Browsers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The interpretation of HTML5 in various in different browsers. This is something which s similar to JavaScript. It is a painful thing to reduce the time between deviation in various browsers. Connecting more platforms and devices makes the problem more complicated. Some of them even ignore vital elements of HTML5.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Solution: Use web animations and run them in Chrome or Opera. Take advantage of the notification feature to enable the user from creating a web page like email delivery. Plan well, for any browser compatibility to deal with issues, in advance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>High-Performance Expectations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just because HTML5 finds its usage in many high profile companies, you cannot expect a company that works in web app development in USA to make use of it. The reality is that many development teams are not finding the language too convenient as they expected it to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Solution</strong>: Do not give up your expectations so early, because many game development companies are implementing HTML5 in the finest manner possible. They are using the language even in their browsers to give even better user experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IDEs Makes Better WebPages</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using IDEs for developing a web page because the code is not in use, is another common mistake which developers commit. No web app development in USA using IDE can make better use of a code apart from DreamWeaver. When you write a code in one IDE it Is completely portable to another IDE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Solution</strong>: Use a text editor like Notepad++. Now run the page in hosting or through a server. Avoid IDEs if you are new in the industry of web app development in USA. They just make thing more complex and creates an obstruction in development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Using Too Much Text Editors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the developers have the habit of using text editors while writing fresh code or modifying the code in case the code doesn’t work out easily. Any developer who is new in the web app development world can make use of it easily. Using many text editors not only creates confusion but also results in wrong coding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Solution</strong>: Write code smoothly along with the correct extension. Notepad comes as a handy tool for writing a code. Syntax highlighting is one of the major benefits for these kinds of editors. Don’t forget to save it with the right extension.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the mistakes mentioned above are common and is the result of implementing HTML5 directly on the website in various browsers. One must avoid the common problems to deliver the best results efficiently. One should spend more time in understanding the latest features of HTML5 and then implement them according to the project requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know that about 30% of the time spent by the developers goes in surfing the source code? The cost of fixing bugs is almost 10 times and 100 times higher in the construction and designing phase respectively. Considering all these <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/want-the-best-web-app-development-use-these-5-javascript-frameworks/">web app development factors</a>, changes have come from time to time to facilitate the process of development. In other words, trends have come to the fore that helped developers to adapt themselves to the latest trends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through this blog, we intend to empower the knowledge of developers or any other code lover who want to keep themselves updated with the latest inclination in the programming industry.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Programming Revolutionizing Our Lives</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The blessings of programming on the human race are immense. It changed our approach to things in everyday life. The great evolution of apps now brings tasks at our fingertips. There is hardly any work left today which doesn’t comply with an application. From development languages to frameworks and development tools, programming underwent a metamorphosis since the last one decade. It is growing rapidly every day with new changes in the client expectation and project execution strategy. Another aspect of programming is that it also includes cloud computing which implements the same programming techniques.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Business is another important area where programming has bestowed its blessings. From the web app development perspective, DevOps, these days are focusing more on the outcomes. They are working closely with the operational team to give meaningful results to every project, which they undertake. Agility and continuous emphasis on development thus remain the two major components in app development. Whether it is PHP or Python, name any programming language today. Each one of them is directly co-related to business. Empowering business websites, extending the functionalities and making agile web apps is the core agenda for any web development company today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two ways of delivering a web app – either as a web application or as a client side application. If you are making an Android based app, you can specify style properties as well as viewport in order to accommodate it on all types of screen. Even defining an interface is now possible with the rise in the technological development happening in the industry. You can also call APIs based on a web application. From debugging to building web apps, programming has ignited the hope of success in web app development since the day of its evolution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest programming trends will act as a guide to DevOps, which they can utilize in their next project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Must To Know Programming Trends</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 1: Rise of Backend Service</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 21st-century programming will primarily focus less on self-managed applications. Rather, it will shift towards using third party services. The benefit will be to handle important aspects of a project in an organized manner. Cloud storage, user administration, and push notifications are some of the things that will come to the fore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rise of BaaS or Backend as a service will become popular and will facilitate the utilities of a web-based application. This will be beneficial from the enterprise point of view where scalability forms a vital part of developing the large-scale application. Now, the operations and engineering teams can compete with their rivals when it comes to delivering the best services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 2: Image Handling Becomes Easier</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With Backend as a service, uploading projects to the cloud or in any other social APIs is easier. But, there are many applications till date which fully rely on the good servers and improved development stacks to function in the best manner possible. Server positioning, on the other hand, becomes too much time consuming and difficult for the developers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Generating images in the machine while working simultaneously with frameworks, languages, libraries and OS help to make containers, this consists of machine images. If your team has not yet adopted or started utilizing it then it’s time to make use of it. The containers also have the ability to create existing services or making a new one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 3: More Dependency On Functional Languages</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest sophisticated applications need more storage capacity, with faster processor requirements and increasing bandwidth. Working with a single machine model makes it cumbersome for a developer to use the systems as the configurations do not match at all. The rise of functional programming has made it mandatory to adapt to new languages for complicated web app development process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Subsequently, there is a need for developers who has the ability to work with such languages. Functional programming, on the other hand, relies heavily on the mutable state. Here, comes the role of a functional language. It has a strong advantage over the normal object-oriented languages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 4: More Focus on Material Design</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the early days of web app development and design, flat design is something, which one was dependent upon, as a modern approach to UI design. But, it was the introduction of Material Design in 2016 that shifted the focus completely. It has given some stiff competition to companies like Apple and Microsoft, which heavily relies on flat design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary USPs  of material design is the three-dimensional effect with a lighting design. It gives a completely different depth to the components used digitally. For instance: when you use drop shadows, it enables the user to understand whether the element used in the application is clickable or not. It is expected that there will be a rise in UI design patterns as creative designers continue to embrace material design.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap up!</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Functional languages in web app development play an important role in increasing the user experience. Knowing the latest trends prevailing in the industry will make the DevOps aware about them and implement them successfully in a project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Single page web applications are something, which has no existence without JavaScript. On the other side of the coin, developing interactive web applications using JavaScript is a cliché in the world of fast <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web app development</a>. Hence, the solution is to use JavaScript frameworks. These frameworks act as steroids and powers up HTML and JavaScript. They help developers to focus on the interactive elements, which creates a great user interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Use of Frameworks In Modern Web Development</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contribution of frameworks in this digitally developing world is immense. Previously, writing codes was all about applying knowledge to develop a robust code. But now, the process has changed. Today, most of the codes consist of APIs. Moreover, a number of tools have evolved today to fasten the process of web app development. One of them is a framework. It enables developers to write a generic code. A good framework consists of tool sets, code libraries, application programming interface, compiler and support programs. They help to club together various components required to develop a project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the JavaScript frameworks mainly run MVC designed structure code to ensure reusable and scalable JavaScript Code. However, it is not necessary that such frameworks should solely base on MVC pattern. Variations might change and implement in accordance with the requirements of the project. The best approach is to maintain a proper code structure. Remember, it is difficult to write an excellent code; hence, the smarter way is to run the API according to the requirements of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These days what matter the most is to have a good knowledge of architecture. Apart from making the traditional API calls, optimizing Objective – C compilers will help you to pick the details of the framework rather than the syntax of the language. Most of the time spent goes in making the inner loops of the libraries. A developer can correct the language details after he or she comes to know about the libraries. Make sure that it’s a changed algorithm. Do not stash it inside the variables. The correct way is to know about the various frameworks and applies them wherever required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With advanced JavaScript frameworks, it’s possible to make the most complex single page applications within minutes. We bring to you 5 most robust frameworks that will simplify the process of web app development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5 Most Robust Frameworks For Best Web App Development</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take a look at the most powerful Javascript frameworks, which are an alternative to JavaScript.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AngularJS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Google product, it’s the most popular frameworks till date. With the biggest online communities, it is just the best web app development framework for single page web application. This framework gives powers to HTML by offering all the features, which are necessary to make dynamic views. Two-way data binding gives the ultimate inputs that enable a developer to view the JavaScript objects. Hence, the hectic process of writing manual code for manipulating the DOM is something, which a developer can avoid. Moreover, the recent release of AngularJS 2 has fixed many bugs and issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>React.JS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most common thing between Facebook and Instagram is it’s user interface which consists of  React.JS. The large scalability of the framework makes it the perfect choice for developers to make complex applications. One of the strong points of React.JS is the use of virtual DOM. A virtual domain makes gives a boost to React.JS. One can render it on the server as well as the client side. Other advantages of React.JS include server-side rendering of DOM, comparing the virtual domain with the actual DOM and updated specific nodes of browser domain instead of rendering the entire domain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ember.JS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s an open-source JavaScript framework. When it comes to usability and functionality, it can compete with AngularJS as well as React.js. Its functionality is somewhat similar to AngularJS where a developer can update the model in accordance with the view, thus synchronizing both the model as well as view changes. To enable better UI rendering, and speed up the performance, the server side rendering facility is something, which is already present in this framework. Something similar to React.js. Hence, combining the two-way binding data and server-side rendering, Ember amazes the developers with its super powers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aurelia.js</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is one framework which is suitable for next generation web app development, then it is Aurelia.js. It is an expert professional community and is one of the strongest frameworks to work with. It consists of numerous modules along with small libraries. As a developer, you can use the full framework while executing a project. Select it on the basis of the project and create a customized framework. The strength of the framework is that it has no external dependencies other than polyfills. For all those developers who have worked with AngularJS 2 and its previous versions, this framework comes across as a fantastic migration path.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Meteor.js</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are somebody who wants to utilize JavaScript fully for complete web app development, then Meteor.js is highly recommended. It consists of features as well as elements used in the backend, frontend, managing database management and business logic. This framework enables you to use JavaScript for overall application development process. A number of server-side packages are available. You can run node.js in all most all the packages to access the database. From the performance point of view, any kind of change in the database reflects in the user interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap up!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, a JavaScript framework has become the basis for developing single page web applications. However, there are many frameworks available in the web app development field today, but the use of these five frameworks ensures that the best project delivery goes to the client.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the advent of what is known as the ‘internet,’ HTML is a synonymous name that has been doing the rounds everywhere. Over the years, it has progressed largely and has undergone an immense change. It has created ripples in the world of <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web app development</a> with its interactive application and stunning designs. As far as functionality and syntax improvement is concerned, HTML 5 has provided the boost when it comes to developing a web page. When combined with CSS3, it can result in making the next generation web application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">HTML might not be a new thing to the web today, but big organizations like Google and Microsoft have recently realized the importance of this standard markup language and is harnessing it even in their browsers as per this latest <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/flash-and-chrome/">blog</a> from Google. So, we can say that the transition of the web from a simple text-based document to a modern program based document is something which has provided the perks to the modern world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Features that make HTML5  stronger</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Semantic Elements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s the presence of the semantic elements that make HTML5 capable enough to be used at such a large scale. Now a web page looks much completed due to the presence of elements such as navigation bar, header, and footer. If you have been using the previous versions of HTML, you might have noticed that as a developer, you were required to make use of &lt;div&gt; along with ID or attributes. Now with the help of HTML5, the semantic structure of the document is uniform. One important thing to mention here is that the use of &lt;div&gt; is perfectly valid as you can keep it for future. Some of the primary elements that are used in HTML5 are &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;hgroup&gt;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Canvas Elements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was originally developed by Apple in order to use it in the Mac OS X. It was again adopted by Opera and Mozilla. Later, the element was standardized and added in HTML5. Along with this, 2D drawings were included in the APIs, which were in turn used in making texts, animations, and transitions. Most of the people believe that canvas element is an important part of HTML, but it doesn’t prove to be of much help in web app development. APIs is an intelligent option to make use of. With the help of an API, a developer can draw shapes, apply a colour of the desired choice and transform the canvas objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Web Enhancements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You must be familiar with HTML’s controls. We’re talking here about the basic input functions here such as file, checkbox, radio, submit text and image. One interesting feature about HTML5 is that it has two stunning features – Autofocus and Placeholder attribute. While the first one instructs the browser to focus on the particular form field, on the other hand, the later enables the developer to enhance text when all the contents are empty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the above-mentioned features of HTML5, there are plenty of other features such as web worker, geo-location, cross document messaging, drag and drop and much more that make this scripting language the best option for web app development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Setting Benchmarks With CSS3 Features</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There have been new additions in the latest version of CSS, which make it the favorite among the developers. It is by far the most wonderful update. The latest versions have come up with a new set of advanced features such as new selectors, negation pseudo classes and state based selectors. A number of effects have been made available in various image formats starting from PNG to GIF and JPEG. Some of the features are widely being used as all other networks are degraded easily in other web browsers. They are similar to that of a newspaper layout where the text is stretchable over the columns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Adjust Multicolumn Layouts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the help of multicolumn layouts, you can effectively manage the property of column gap. This will help the developer to expressively define the space where the column width method will be used. Not only this-this will also enable him or her to make use of the border style in between columns.  Currently, multi-column layouts are supported in both Mozilla and Webkit. Currently, they are implemented with temporary proprietary. The perfect decision is to move the browsers to CSS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Web Fonts For Better Results</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know that the usage of web fonts was out forward for CSS2? However, it could not be implemented at that point in time as there was a need for a proprietor and there were no browser vendors at that moment who would be able to distribute the web fonts. The latest versions of all browsers starting from Mozilla to Firefox and Chrome, a developer can make use of the @font-face on the web page. One important thing to keep in mind here is that these fonts are used as images. You can either pay for them or can also make use of the royalty free web fonts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Supporting New Features</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a host of other features, which make CSS3, the preferable web app development tool. Its support for new colour values like RGBA and HSLA are the unique features, which help the developers to handle media queries. For instance: as a developer, you can mention styles for devices, which has less than 500 pixels. The speech module enables you to adjust specific properties of a screen reader such as balance, stress and voice volume.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both HTML5 and CSS3 prove as a support to each other when it comes to developing the most modern web apps. They are inseparable and is making a big breakthrough in the web app development world. All the important mobile platforms today use either android or iOS and any other WebKit-based browsers, hence it is evident that CSS3 and HTML5 will prove to be of greater benefit. All the major browser vendors are increasingly making use of HTML5 plugins instead of using the plugins of Adobe Flash.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Google may or may not have intended to have something of deeper understanding to announce their new instant publishing product AMP at Sadelle’s, known for its bagel. There are has been a lot of escalation in the technology in the past few years and we have found the big daddies to fight over almost every aspect to change the media industry forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last few months, there are some quick launches let us take a wrap-up of them –</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Facebook launched <a href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/solutions/instant-articles" target="_blank">Instant Articles</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Twitter launched <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2015/moments-the-best-of-twitter-in-an-instant-0.html" target="_blank">Moments</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Apple launched <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-news/" target="_blank">Apple News</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. Amazon thinking to give away <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/09/washington-post-now-free-amazon-prime/">The Washington Post</a> to Prime subscribers for free</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now Google plans to join the race. Well, we can guess from now that these tech giants and not the publishers will be steering the chief distributions of news that we consume daily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google has launched their new AMP short form of the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project and it is a continuation of the trend. However, the tack is different from Facebook and Apple. Google is after all about web thus AMP aims to ensure that the web content loads much instantly and look sleek as it would have done with the native apps. As per Google’s head of news Richard Gingras, “This is about the World Wide Web,” “This is about making sure the World Wide Web is not the World Wide Wait.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The end goal is not that like of Facebook’s Instant Articles, which helps the publishers like National geographic, The Casablanca Times and Buzzfeed to publish stories directly to Facebook. Therefore, users never have to click out of Facebook to read an article. The stories are going to load ten times faster.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we talk of AMP, we will find that it is a part of the open source project at Google. While Facebook onboard the publishers leaving others to wonder how their stories will appear in the New Feed, Google in comparison to them is not at all selective. They are opening publishing platform for all. What’s more, the opening code base on GitHub allows the developers to write the code easily. AMP is “a deal-less environment.” You have no particular nations participating in it, open source projects means we all can participate irrespective of your nation or background, Gingras puts it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google has been working at present with selected group of publishers to test AMP like Buzzfeed, who have also collaborated on Instant Articles. Dao Nguyen, BuzzFeed’s publisher, says she does not see the two products as competitive. “It’s completely different,” she said. “This is the web.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google announced AMP on October 7 Gingras says the new format won’t be live until “a later date.” It will be working peculiarly in this way – people types in “Bruno Mars on the mobile web, and soon will find a carousel of stories with brighter images and clickable headlines. Click on a story, content, image, and advertisements, all will be loading instantly and simultaneously, so a slow-loading ad will not cause a page to scroll up or down abruptly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now the question is when AMP opens to the public, how will this new format affect the mass of publishers and their search engine ranks? Google is not going to privilege certain formats over others, so publishers can choose to try to maximize performance on their own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is will interesting to note down the reaction of Facebook team after all an article becoming AMP compatible will show up instantly on the Facebook, according to Melissa Bell, co-founder of Vox.com and vice president of growth and analytics for Vox Media, which is an early AMP tester. This could help the users rather the publishers to surface contents on Facebook faster without having to be part of Facebook’s walled garden.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Google is leveraging the mobile web solution with the de facto advantage of speed as they feel, “Anything less than instant simply shows a degradation and decline in engagement,” says Gingras. They hope to provide the publishers with faster, cleaner content on the web will drive engagement. Users put less attention to the web as they know that there is something else ready to read if one articles just does not open in the nick of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the greatest beneficiaries will be Twitter, while they are not dealing with the publisher but are playing a pivotal role in the News platform. Most recently, they have launched the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/meet-moments-twitters-new-feature/" target="_blank">Moments feature</a> which makes new easier to follow Twitter, by organizing Tweets in chronological manner, you can also call it a coherent timeline. Twitter is now going to load articles or news automatically compatible with AMP as AMP files, this means it will benefit from the same speed inside the Twitter app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Technically speaking, Google plays the decisive role in determining which news is important, so do Facebook and Twitter plays a similar role. These platforms are not only determining what news matters to us, but they also deciding on the best way to present and publish it, as well. And as they continue to achieve success, the media industry will increasingly look to these companies for evidence of what works and respond earlier and what not. It is going to change the way we read news!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, spanking new opportunities opening up with the Web, hence <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/" target="_blank">web app development company</a> looks for new possibilities to jump-in.</p>

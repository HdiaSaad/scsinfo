										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">To make a sustainable business and make it user-oriented, it is imperative to have a mobile app. From entrepreneurs to small business shop owners, it’s a faster way to communicate with their target customers. The process of <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank">mobile app development</a> is evolving at a rapid pace today than it was five years ago. Commercialization and monetization are two vital aspects that matter the most these days.  In fact, it all depends on the choice of the platform. Now-a-days, a systematic and user-oriented approach can help to develop the right mobile app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the dearth of time in the development period, app developers often face the challenge of making an app within the deadline mentioned by the client.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">For mobile developers who are looking to extend the functionality of an application in more than one platform without changing the tool set and language of the platform, Apache Cordova comes as an instant solution to them. With the growing demand of mobile application around the world and the rapid advancement of mobile app development (where mobile app downloads are expected to reach 268.69 billion by 2017 as per this Statista report) the demand for innovative mobile apps are fuelling the rise of advance mobile technology frameworks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/robustness-of-hybrid-mobile-application-development-and-its-utility/">mobile app development industry is growing</a> by leaps and bounds today, there are some robust technologies which are making it possible to develop scalable applications. One of them is Apache Cordova. Throughout this blog, we are going to analyze how can this mobile framework contribute towards making the app development process more advance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Brief Outlook of Cordova</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The emergence of Cordova is due to the need of such an open source mobile development framework that would work even while developing a cross platform development app. It removes the hassles of relying on APIs of iOS, Windows or an Android; instead, it helps mobile app developers to make an app using HTML 5, CSS3 and JavaScript.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Which Development Paths To Follow?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before you start developing an app in any OS, it is important to know which development paths are you going to use. Well, there are two main workflows which you can follow – Cross platform Workflow (CLI) and Platform Centered Workflow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cross Platform Workflow, as the name suggests can be used to run an application in various operating systems. It is mainly centered around Cordova. Web assets with similar sets are copied and transferred into subdirectories in separate mobile platforms. The developer can also use a different set of plugins on a common interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, platform centered workflow, can be used if you want to combine the custom native components along with the Cordova components. Here, lower level shell scripts are used for each platforms. Plugins are available for each one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To give you an idea of the Cordova architecture for developing a mobile app or web app, we are presenting you with an exclusive graphic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Simplifying The Mobile App Development Process</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cordova eases the process of mobile app development by offering an array of benefits. Take a look at them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Implementing  Modern Web Technologies:</strong> In the beginning of this blog, you might have come to know about the use of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3. Well, it might be difficult for a developer to adopt to Cordova, he or she can at the same time learn modern technologies like AngularJS and JQuery as they are used often in Cordova.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saves Coding Time:</strong> In Cordova, one can write the same code in various platforms. One doesn’t have to face the problem of porting as no changes are required to be made. As a result, the development time can be reduced to a large extent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>UI Problems Solved:</strong> Browsing a website in a Smartphone might be at times cumbersome as the user has to scroll through a web page thus making it a difficult process. Cordova comes loaded with multiple libraries that makes user interface an interactive and engaging experience for the users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advanced Plugins:</strong> In order to make a native app, you require multiple plug in, but in Cordova a number of plugins are already included. As a result, the developer is empowered with accessing special features such as determining the current location, accessing the file paths and many more. Another benefit of Cordova is that it has a number of community plugins, which makes it easier for the developers to manage any issue within the app with complete ease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Things to Consider to Make a Cordova based iOS or Android App</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, iOS and Android are the two most popular mobile operating systems that exists around the world. Keeping Cordova at the backend and using it as a framework offers some exceptional benefits to both these operating systems, but at the same time it is important to keep in mind some important things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s take a look…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Plugins Intelligently:</strong> Since Cordova comes with considerably less number of APIs, it is important that to add some plugins. You can search them in the Cordova Plugin Registry; they provide an easy access to the geo location, Camera and Battery, that are supported across multiple platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Decide About The Versions:</strong> Are you going to use Cordova in the recently released iOS 9 or Android Nouget? all the third party plugins are pretty advanced in Cordova, hence it is important to check that whether the operating system which you are using support such plugins or not. You can even add various platform versions in order to simplify the CSS selectors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Form Factors To Consider:</strong> As far as the forms are concerned, keep in mind about responsiveness as the whole world today accesses a website either through a tablet or a Smartphone. Moreover, the designers as well as the testers should be aware about the methodologies to be applied for developing apps both for iOS and Android.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Offline Support Is Important:</strong> While making a Cordova based iOS or Android application you must keep in mind about how a particular app is going to work that doesn’t need any internet connection. For instance: a calculator. In that case you can make use of the Cordova Network connection in order handle the connection issue properly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Testing Matters:</strong> It is a known fact that emulators or simulators fasten the process of testing a mobile application, but one cannot ignore the usability of real time testing. A real device might be more effective in handling bugs or issues as compared to the manual devices, which are already available. Debugging Corodova based application can at times be difficult but if you are accustomed with Safari and Chrome, then nothing beats that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cordova not only simplifies the app development process, but it saves the development time to a considerable extent. We recommend to the developers that they use an existing framework while making an application. Doing this will not only structure the application but will also add a number of components that will give the mobile application a more native look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to develop a robust Cordova based iOS or Android app, then write us a mail at <a href="mailto:info@unifiedinfotech.net">info@unifiedinfotech.net</a> with your requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">You probably know whom to blame if you have been glued to your mobile phone since the last one month. The addiction has reached to such a level that it has superseded Facebook as far as user engagement is concerned. Within a month of this augmented reality game, Pokémon is really riding high with more than 26 million daily users.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Let the stats speak for you</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The intensity of the game is such that previously even games like Temple Run, Candy Crash Saga have not witnessed such global acceptance at such a humongous level. Now looking at it from a business point of view and that too using it as a learning tool by a mobile app development company is something that will help business owners, marketing heads and each one in an organization to make further developments or bring any changes in the way they operate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, is it the social part or the fun factor attached with this game that makes it such a huge hit among the masses? Well, all mobile retailers around the world are giving a ball of time with this game and we being an app development company will let you know the different lessons that we can learn from Pokémon Go.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Go The Pokémon Way</strong></em></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 1: Make Mobile Ready Experiences </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of merely developing an app for enhancing the user experience in desktop or mobile web browsing, one should focus more on <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/react-native-app-development/">developing native apps</a> for making their services available to the end level customer. Here, it is important to study the choices and preferences of the target audience. Secondly, the uses of native apps enable any web page to open faster, which is a catalyst in increasing the engagement of the customer. Hence, higher conversions lead to increasing revenue.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 2: Synchronizing Online With Offline</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just as Pokemon Go merges a native app with a mobile device thus connecting the offline with online, in the same way, retailers can promote their product as a brand that can be enjoyed by the customer both at the retail store and in an ecommerce website as well. Merging the world of online and offline has resulted in more engagement. Thus, the concept of multi-channel and omni-channel is made use in just the perfect way. Once, you find a Pokemon, you enter in the virtual world. In the same way, to give a similar delightful experience to the users, retailers can optimize their channels.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 3: Innovation For More Engagement</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have been a Pokemon fan, then you must have known about its previous forms starting with a comic character to a movie and then to a toy. By innovating itself into an augmented reality app, it has utilized innovation to increase the user interaction. If the same principle is applied even in case of a mobile app development company. To make your mobile business a hit, you can also combine technology and be in the front line of companies, which is famous for innovation. Geo fencing can be one of the innovative measures that can be adopted.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 4: Branding Can Sell Everything</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if you have made one of the finest apps, then you won’t be able to make it popular, until and unless you are branding your product. Think about Pokemon, it has been in the market for more than 20 years, and still continues to rule, the reason? Good branding! So, this can be another takeaway for businesses that branding should form a major part in planning the marketing strategy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 5: Going Social Is The Weapon</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A business will not come in the public glare unless somebody knows and talks about it. No marketing tool is better than social media. Starting from Facebook to Tumblr, Twitter, Pinterest and YouTube, the Pokémon madness has spread everywhere. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/10-tips-to-running-a-successful-social-media-marketing-campaign/">This is the reason</a> why you, the whole world and me are talking about this.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Factors That Make Pokemon Such A Hit</strong></em></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Engaging To The Core</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have played the game, then you will know that there are no end to collecting the Pokemons. It is endless. In other games, you will find a pro version or certain levels that ask you to complete in order to reach to the final level. No such things are present in this game. As a result, the users find it more interesting that ultimately increases the engagement level.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Retaining Is the Key</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to create a strong retention in the mind of the users, Pokémon Go has a unique capture session. You will notice that each angle of Pokémon is different in different angles. The interesting thing to note here is that there is user-generated content behind each session. Moreover, the mastery curve is smooth enough to help you build an array of Pokémon, which will help you to advance in the game further.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Viral Makes It More Popular</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can go on inviting as much friends as you want in this augmented reality game. It allows you to read stories on the internet and know about the player’s experiences. There never has been a game such as this that has spread virally around the whole world. Since, it is related to an existing social graph, this is the reason why people have started liking it so much. Niantic, the maker of the game has more plans already to make the game more interactive in the real world.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Monetization Factor</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to monetization, there is no doubt in the fact that it is topping the lists of downloads in the app store. It is merely not an unending game, but also gives an opportunity to the player to earn money. By purchasing the license, one can increase the rate of capturing sessions. The players do not have to wait, instead they keep throwing at each other and at the same time enjoy a delightful experience.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Wrap Up!</em></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These lessons are precious for an organization that deals in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/">mobile app development</a>. Once you imply them, you will certainly witness an increase in the customer acquisition and retention. The key to successfully making your product popular among your customers is to market it well like Pokémon Go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From a basic communication device to using it as a virtual reality device, there are merely any functions left behind by mobile technology. By introducing extended capabilities, it has helped mankind to witness the technological upsurge in a rapid phase, but what lies next? Is there something more in store? Will mobile technology amaze us with new discoveries? Such questions are bound to come in our minds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout this blog, we will share with you the upcoming changes which you are all set to witness in the field of <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a> and how will mobile technology shape up the world in the years to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s put an end to all your curiosity and present to you the future of mobile technology which we and the coming generation are going to witness.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‘Augmented Reality’ Close To Reality</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Virtual Reality is making news everywhere, Augmented Reality is the next one in the line. Using the GPS on your smartphone to find the nearest restaurant or places of interest is a cliché now. Augmented Reality will enable users to find them offline just by activating their camera. Yes, this is going to be this easy. In the next few years, this feature will undergo many new transformations to give the user more relevant search results. Combining computer data and fetching it to the users in real time will be a challenging task, though, but nevertheless, it will pave the way for mobile app development.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Foldable Flexible Screens</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tired of carrying your large screen Smartphones everywhere? Why not fold it? Yes, the dream of carrying that large screen smartphone will finally come true as foldable screens will come in the near future to make your phone pocket-friendly. The Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) technology will make this possible. This means you can view from both sides of the phone and perform dual activities from both sides. If accepted well, by the masses, it can further evolve into a wearable device. Imagine you are wearing your smartphone on your wrist. An interesting concept. Isn’t it?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advanced Voice Control</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The voice recognition system will now be at its best. Many researches have been done in order to develop the quality of voice, but time and again it has proved to be a hectic task. Just as Siri introduced the system of voice recognition by interpreting the diction and syntax of the speech, in the same way, use of a natural user interface at a more advanced level will overtake the current way of communication. Seamless voice control will emerge as the next voice control app. Such kind of feature will increase the interactivity as far as Smartphones are concerned. Thus, this mobile technology will certainly prove to be the best.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Moving Beyond 3D Screens</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Apple has raised the bar with retina display, the introduction of 3D screens have brought forward crystal clear screen display by enabling the user to view from three dimensions. The more advanced level of viewing experience beyond 3D could be the use of holograms. This could totally change our viewing experience in a smartphone. Integrating the movements along with the 3D displays will allow you to compress or adjust the size of your pictures just with the help of a single touch.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What To Expect From Android In The Future ?</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than half of the mobile population around the world makes use of Android Smartphones.</p>
<h3><strong>1. An All New Google Map</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can expect a much more sophisticated version of the Google Maps with helpful features. Google is already in talks for hiring the street view cameras so that it can allow the users to get a clear inside view of a building or a monument. Detailing will be the primary focus of the app.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. More Secured Payments </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though many secured methods for payments have been adopted such as OTP and an SSL payment gateway, but in the near future, it is all set to get complicated, so that transaction becomes much easier. Fingerprint recognition and iris scanning can be the next process of payment.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Innovation In Hardware</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There could be a complete change in the hardware of your smartphone. As discussed in this blog earlier, that one could also see a foldable screen in the future. In future, Smartphones could be the new wearables and will completely change the way we communicate with a mobile.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What To Expect From iOS In The Future?</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the Worldwide Developer’s Conference, 2016, Tim Cook announced a number of technological upgrades apart from releasing iOS10.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Upgraded iMessaging </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the recently released version of iOS10, one can reply to a message instantly on receiving the notifications. In the near future, the focus of Apple will be to extend the concept of messaging to third parties. Moreover, the secondary focus will be mainly on increasing the font size and creating bigger emoticons.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Improving the User Interface</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In each version, Apple has upgraded its user interface, but what holds in the near future is really a matter of curiosity for iPhone lovers. Shifting to OLED screens is an indication that can change the user interface that Apple has been maintaining all the while. As a result, the user can benefit from saving the battery even in dark mode.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Richer Notifications  </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apple has taken a significant leap as far as adjusting the notifications are concerned. Media rich notifications will be the key agenda and no application will be required to open in order to view the notifications box. This up gradation will pull the user more towards installing the application.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Transformation For Business </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the years to come, mobile technology will have a transformational effect on the business. Starting from IT to marketing and corporate sector, it will have a chain of effects and will drastically change the way we work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rise Of The Virtual Office</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By 2020, it is expected that one doesn’t need to be physically present at the workstation. Digital space will overtake the cabins and desks. With the rapid evolution of video calls, messaging and email, business houses need to strategize in the most calculative manner in order to get the work done.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mobile Tech To Become A Real Player</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, most of the people around the world depend on a smartphone rather than on his laptop or computer. With the massive mobile user around the world, there is no doubt that in future, people are mostly going to use their mobile for all kinds of official work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ERP Systems To Rise</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The need to real time availability of business reports and data is becoming the need of the hour in this era of competitive business development. Everything must be at your fingertips every time. With the introduction of ERP, you will have access to custom reports from anywhere. Hence, this will ease the process of business development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile devices have revolutionized our life since their advent and it will continue to amaze us with their amazing impact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The term ‘communication heavy internet services’ might sound alien to you, but not too big IT giants like Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft. In fact, the term can be termed as a source of revenue generation for them. The gradual shift from display-based information through programs to browser-based information has a huge role to play in the age of digital transformation. As we are blazing forward in this age software based technologies, data is becoming outdated and is in the dire necessity for usage of the more sophisticated storage platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The challenges prevailing in the online industry are being replaced easily with cloud computing. This rapid development is characterized by advancements made in technology such as the introduction of more disk storage, faster internet access, and inexpensive servers. All of these are pushing the concept of cloud computing forward in such a way that by 2020, the cloud market is going to earn a revenue of nearly $55 billion as per a report published by International Trade Administration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Native cloud apps, the new name in the <a title="Mobile App Development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a> world is of immense benefit from the developer’s perspective. Apart fro <span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1.  <strong>Automatic Management Of Resources</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any third party application, the resources that are to be used in making an app are provided to the developers. A native cloud application enables a developer to take advantage of the resources as they are automatically available. With self-service, programmatic provisioning and on-demand allocation of resources, all critical business applications run quite smoothly. Such kind of application can handle the task of pooling the resources, managing the data analytics very swiftly.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2.  <strong>Easily Manage Business Needs</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is an ‘auto scale’ feature, which is available in the native cloud applications. In case of any emergency situation such as a complicated up down process, it enables the enterprises to come up with a solution easily. Hence, by paying only for computing resources, an enterprise can provide backup for its business needs quite easily.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3.  <strong>Minimize Risk Failure</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the powerful benefits of using such kinds of apps is that they can tackle outages and make corrective actions in case of app failure. The application processing moves from one data center to the other without causing any disruption in the service and the surprising thing is that the user doesn’t even come to know that whether there was even an outage or not while running the application.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Cloud Native Apps And App Architecture</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a direct co-relation between the native cloud and the architecture of an app. These two often prove to be the best combination and help to develop an app in the most sophisticated manner. Now let’s see how do they help to improve an app’s architecture.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1.  <strong>Advanced Frameworks</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The infrastructure used in a native cloud app is based on container driven architecture and highly automated infrastructure. This is the reason why the software runs so easily which is developed with a native cloud app. The basic mechanism that works behind this is the single code base that helps to organize from many environments using a single codebase. Moreover, the presence of cloud as a platform helps to declare the dependency in a more organized manner.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong>Better App Run Times</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What makes such apps a hot favorite is the use of the containers. Being lightweight by nature, such apps work well in a cloud-ready environment by improving resource efficiency as well as fastening the process of mobile app development. In the development stage, the presence of a container reduces the time of a developer to write codes and create a developer oriented cloud apps. Thus, a developer can have full control over the resources each time he or she develops an app.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. <strong>Improved Infrastructure For Automation</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The robust automation process of native cloud apps does everything starting from updating routers to provisioning services by deploying apps and managing the log aggregation activities. It also serves as an excellent platform for managing the elasticity of computational resources. These advanced automation practices help the developer to avoid the extra task of deploying each node of the app infrastructure.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. <strong>Complete Control Over Documents</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as data security is concerned, cloud computing is no doubt the ultimate solution as it helps to protect your data in a safe manner, but did you ever wonder how it helps to improve the security of an app. All the important documents related to mobile application development are stored in the most secure manner in the cloud. Since the files are stored centrally in one server, it streamlines the process of development. No matter who accesses the machine of your organization, you can be at complete peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is due to the looming deadlines of clients that make a native cloud app so much popular. Since the architecture of an app plays a key role while making one, it is vital that one should make use of the most robust technologies and dynamic databases that are supported by cloud.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>The Future Ahead</strong></em>…</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as the software delivery capabilities are concerned, cloud-based native applications will help to transform the capabilities of an IT organization and help it emerge as a strong player amidst the competitive market. Developers are the ones who will be benefitted the most with such kinds of technologies. Hence, a bright future lies ahead for native cloud apps.</p>

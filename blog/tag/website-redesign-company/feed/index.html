										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The redesign operations for any site starts with a lot of planning and strategizing. But more often than not, these practices do not bring in expected results. What might be the reason for that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main problem is the fact that most of the time clients come in with the idea that web design and web redesign are the same processes. The familiarity with one assures them of familiarity with another process, and that produces problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a sharp variation within </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign challenge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and normal design challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both procedures are very contrasting from the inside. And that’s why I with my team have created this guide that intends to clear out the confusion and provide an in-depth understanding of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to redesign a website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Stock Of Your Website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the thing about</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> redesigning your website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;  it starts with an already existing and functional site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not a ‘build-from-the-scratch’ mission, rather ‘fix-the-problematic-area’ mission. And to do it right, the site has to be inspected first. And that’s why this is the first step of this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign guide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll find plenty of issues when inspecting the site. These areas undoubtedly need to be fixed. Now based on the website, you’ll find various issues. </span></p>
<p>During my experience in running a <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">web design company in Casablanca</a>, I have gathered information that can help you make the decision the right way.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of some basic complications that happen to every site. </span></p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> There are plenty of good analytics tools out there like Google Analytics,  Google Pagespeed Insights, GTmatrix, etc. Use these to get a full idea of the state of the website.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Lack Of Parallelity </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business has a unique identity. And the design needs to reflect it seamlessly. A lot of business owners looking for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">affordable website design</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forget to count in the matter of business identity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then disaster ensues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though initially your site matched with business identity, later on, it might not. The identity of the business can change as it grows, and the site design needs to change accordingly as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So take a look at the site and consider if it matches the business identity. If it doesn’t, then it is time to change it. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Where Are The Results?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of reasons for a business to have a site. From escalating revenue generation to getting traffics. But at the end of the day, only one goal matters, and that is- to make the business more successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when analyzing the old website, ask if the website bringing in the kind of result expected? If not, then put the site through inspection and pinpoint the problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be an important part of the entire </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign strategy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. The Relevancy Of The Design</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web design is evolving every day. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">modern website design trends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change regularly, and most successful ones out there are keeping up without any problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the site was designed in early 2010 and carrying the same design since then, it’s high time for a redesign. Backdated designs cause both aesthetic issues and technical issues, rendering the site unusable. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Issue With Engagement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good website is always appealing to its users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When considering a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think about whether the website is attracting the users. Inspect the web content, images, information structure of the website. If it is failing to engage and excite the visitors, then it is time to change it all.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. The Bounce Rate Dilemma </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This issue puts a lot of sites in jeopardy. The more people leave as soon as they enter the site, the bigger problem will be.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There can be plenty of reasons for users to desert the site. These reasons can range from misleading page content to slow website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever it might be, the website analysis stage can determine these reasons and help in finding solutions. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outline The Website Redesign You Want</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website redesign</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fixes the problems of the site as well as adds more elements to it. This is the time to consider the ingredients that make a perfect site is like and include those elements on the website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process won’t work without a clear action plan. After acquiring the basic idea of what needs to be changed, go on and list out what needs to be added to the websites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The requirements might be different based on the type of trade. but the basic requirements for a successful website remain the same. And if the website is lacking any of these, then add it to the list of requirements ASAP.</span></p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For the <span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, conduct a market and competitor inspection. Analyze the prosperous websites in the industry, and compare that to the website. Find out what is lacking, and add those requirements to the list.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Well Planned Page Architecture</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every page needs to follow an architectural pattern necessary to help site visitors find the right information. This architecture is based on a lot of research and visitor behavior on the page. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12438" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12438" style="width: 987px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-12438 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low-fidelity-wireframe@1.5x.jpg" alt="website architecture " width="987" height="852" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low-fidelity-wireframe@1.5x.jpg 987w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low-fidelity-wireframe@1.5x-300x259.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low-fidelity-wireframe@1.5x-768x663.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12438" class="wp-caption-text">Low Fidelity wireframing</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this matter is going to be the best way to proceed. With proper help, it will be easier to understand how the demographic has changed and what kind of IA they prefer on web pages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The structure of the information on the page can always be improved for better results.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Website Navigation: The Smoother The Better</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This element is important to provide users with a clear way of finding information on the site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Done perfectly, it also assists the site to perform well among the search results. It works with the user intuition to provide them with a streamlined path to information on the site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s always room for improvement, and even if the website has a functional navigational flow, it can be improved upon. While analyzing, compare the entire flow of wayfinding on the site with other sites in the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comparison will help to understand what is lacking in the site’s navigation. This is going to be a much-needed addition to your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/website-redesign-tips/">redesign strategy</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Does Your Website Have The Client’s Trust?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No business functions without having their client’s trust. And when it comes to earning the trust of the clients, content is a key player. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12439" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12439" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12439 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clients-trust-1024x384.jpg" alt="client testimonial in website redesign" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clients-trust-1024x384.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clients-trust-300x112.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clients-trust-768x288.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clients-trust.jpg 1182w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12439" class="wp-caption-text">Example of portraying client&#8217;s trust</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The content of the website assists in convincing the people about the quality and authenticity of the work. The redesign is going to be the perfect time to do a content analysis, and then change them up to gain the client’s trust. Good quality content is necessary for earning the client’s trust in business. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Conversion funnel (including placements of CTAs)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every site exists to alter visitors into clients. There is a clear flow of path to this transformation and it is visualized as a funnel, and hence why the name Conversion funnel.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12423" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12423" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12423 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/conversion-funnel.png" alt="website redesign funnel" width="512" height="396" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/conversion-funnel.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/conversion-funnel-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12423" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Crazyegg.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are four steps to this- awareness, interest, design, and action. It is an automated system designed to attract and transform potential clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no need for any manual action if the site already consists of a clear path of transformation for clients. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> process is the perfect time to understand how to integrate this automated system to get, maximum clients. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Action Stage</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing changes without action. Even the previous two steps, necessary for the redesign would not work if the right actions are not taken. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of times problems appear at this stage due to the lack of knowledge on how to proceed through this project. </span></p>
<p>Here is a list of actions you need to take in order to ensure that the redesign process becomes successful.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Choosing The Right Team to Plan Your Website Redesign</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having the right team for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesigning process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is absolutely crucial. Whether it is an in house designers and developers, of hiring an agency, the team needs to have the right players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">professional website designers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other professionals needed for the entire project-</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Digital strategist:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is the member of the team who will define the whole strategy to transform visitors for the redesigned site. </span></li>
<li><b>Information architect:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the team member who will build the right structure to present information to the end-user as well as build an overall structure to help the user find the way through the website.</span></li>
<li><b>UX designer:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this person will take all the input from the above-mentioned people and then create a site that is designed for maximum levels of efficiency on the website. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of clients come in thinking that only a designer is needed for the redesign. The fact remains that it is the very last task. The above team members will conduct crucial tasks, such as market analysis, brand study, etc. The designer will build based on this research. </span></p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Even if a <span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign agency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> claims to include professionals, do not believe them. Check out the portfolio and client review of that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">agency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prior to making any decisions on hiring.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Aim High With Proper Planning for Website Redesign</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every site is built with different objectives in mind that are subjected to change over time. And the site needs to reflect this change perfectly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the redesign process, it is necessary to evaluate the previous goals and then change them when necessary. The changes occur depending on client demographic, changing industry scenarios, and the size of the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s crucial to consult </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">local website designer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before redefining the objectives and diving deeper into the process. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. A Fictional Persona To Understand The Requirments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the goals are set, it’s time for you and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’ve hired to think and imagine a client persona. This is essential for understanding the demographic, its needs, and how to best cater to it. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12440" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12440" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12440 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-persona@2x-1024x710.jpg" alt="website redesign" width="1024" height="710" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-persona@2x-1024x710.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-persona@2x-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-persona@2x-768x533.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/user-persona@2x.jpg 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12440" class="wp-caption-text">Defining the user persona</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of information required for this step-</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Age </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasons for accessing the internet</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How they access the internet</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What devices are used </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behavior on the internet (including the type of websites they search for, the kind of things they buy, etc)</span></li>
<li>Their needs, frustration, and motivation</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This stage assists with redesigning the site interface. This ensures a memorable encounter with the site for the visitors and makes them come back again and again. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Time To Finalize The Product</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final step is the culmination of all the research and tasks you’ve done till now. All the results and statistics collected go into the design phase, which can be divided into a few steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design phase is divided into four parts. And sure these often overlap but having clear and precise knowledge can ensure that the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website redesign process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ends successfully. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Wireframe creation</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first stage. It is when the skeleton frame of the site is built, depending on the information on IA, navigations best practices, etc.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Content creation</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the wireframing is done, comes the content creation stage. This stage is based heavily on the research and analysis data from previous stages. All content is aimed at impressing and gaining the trust of the visitors. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Designing the UI</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this stage, the interface of the site is revamped. Using the research information and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">modern website design trends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the site interface is updated, then handed over to the developers for development.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Development</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the last point. Once the site is finalized through coding and programming, it goes in for a final check for bugs and other problems. Once these are smoothened out, the site can go live for the users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s about it, the entire procedure of reconstructing the design. But before concluding, here is an extra advice section- the errors to dodge during this process.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mistakes To Avoid At All Costs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> redesigning your website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there are a few errors that can be extremely harmful. Keep an eye open throughout the procedure so that none of these errors happen to the site.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Not Testing The Website Before Launch</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not testing the site before launching is a grave error to make. Once the site is done developing, put it through the testing procedure in order to determine that it reaches all the necessary goals. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Not Integrating A Sitemap</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sitemap of a site helps the bots to scan it. It is important to improve the navigation of the site, as well as for improving site rankings. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Spending Budget Yet Unnecessary Integrations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ordinary misconception about the entire operation often leads the clientele to blow the budget over unnecessary integrations on the site believing that it is going to help it to be successful. However, this only increases the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">web redesign cost</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and produces problems. So frame the budget carefully before starting the operation.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping Up</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different kinds of clients perceive web redesign in different ways. Some consider it to be incredibly daunting, while some think of it in a lightweight manner. No matter what, the right moves in redesign operation is crucial for the success of the site.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">With the festive season approaching near, the excitement level has reached its crescendo. People are now waiting for the D-day of celebration as a number of occasions comes ahead in the next few weeks, starting with the Thanksgiving Day, followed subsequently with bigger celebrations like Cyber Monday, Black Friday, Christmas and New Year. With most of the retailers going online with their business, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>website redesign</strong></a> is a game-changing factor for them, who want to revamp the structure and design of his or her website, this holiday season.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Holiday Season And Buying Behaviour</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The PwC 2016 Holiday Outlook report, estimates that holiday spending in the US is going to increase by 10% in 2016 as compared to the previous year. Moreover, the positive aspect is that there will be a 25% increase in digital sales, which is a great news for online retailers. Shoppers will spend an average amount of $1,121 on per head basis. Hence, these strong statistics strongly suggest that there will be a blast in the selling carts and retailers will reap away the maximum profits from this year’s holiday season sale. Faster checkout options, affordable prices, and well-stocked stores are the three characteristics which are going to rule the shopping industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As global borders continue to blur in online shopping, there has been a wide acceptance of mobile commerce all over the world. The increasing usage of mobile phone hence acts as a contributing factor to the massive holiday sales this year. Brands are available today within a tap on the mobile screen and consumers are eager to get an instant delivery of their desired product. Independent retailers and local businessmen have a great opportunity to tap potential customers from the market. With mobile phone usage at a rapid rate, it will be become easier for marketers to understand the consumer&#8217;s behavior. At the same time, they can also imply the right marketing strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Website Redesign is an important area that always remains on top of the website checklist especially during holiday season. This part of the year is perhaps the best ever time when one can utilize all the resources and implement them to earn the maximum revenue. A clever website redesign combined with the right marketing strategy will lay out the perfect revenue-earning path. After reading this blog, you will be more confident and take the right decision when it comes to redesigning your website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>So, Is Your Website Ready For The Holiday Season?</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make your website ready for the upcoming holiday season, it is necessary to go for a redesign. However, you must ask yourselves to ask some questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Are The CTAs And Buy Buttons Effective?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want visitors who keep on hopping from one website to the other get stuck to your website, then the only way to do it is by designing effective call-to-action buttons that converts the visitors in to full time customers. For instance: just below the purchasing item, you can keep a number of options like warranty options apart from the ‘Add to cart’ option. An ‘add to wish list’ item is yet another interesting way to keep customers stay at your website for a longer time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Can Your Website Handle Multiple Visitors? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you go for a website redesign or any other development feature, always ask yourself, can your website handle multiple visitors? Holiday season is the peak time when you will witness a flood of visitors. Well, if you think that your website is not capable enough, fret not. Either go for shared hosting or a dedicated hosting. While you might have heard about these two kinds of hosting, however, Colocated hosting is yet another kind of hosting which can ease your task. Here, the company purchases server in its own name and has the host facility with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do You Want To Go For Redesign?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have been experiencing a slump in the number of visitors in your website, then it is the time that you go for a website redesign immediately. This is perhaps the best time to rebrand your business. Make changes in the navigation structure of the website and its URLs to help the customers get a new look for your website rather than experiencing the same bored look. You can also implement a 301 redirect plan. In addition to this, one can also change the fonts. Add a festive touch to the fonts to have a maximum impact on the visitors.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Jazz Up Your Website With These Amazing Holiday Tips</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use a pop up on the home page of your website with a nice animation. This could also be a gif.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Write a holiday special blog post.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Send holiday special coupons to customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spread the word in social media regarding any new deals or offers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep in touch with last year’s buyers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Showcase the holiday special products in your home page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Highlight the sign up portion of email.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Introduce customers to new brands.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap Up!</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no better time, other than the holiday season to improve your bottom line. Website redesign acts as a catalyst to keep the profits consistent through the year. Keep in mind that your website is bound to get busier during the holiday season, hence it should be redesigned in such a way that it attracts the maximum traffic to the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Customers always look for something unique and interesting. You cannot let them down especially during the holiday season. Understanding the customer psyche and turning them into real time customers is the key to making your e-commerce website ready.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, experts believe that voice search is the next big thing in the eCommerce landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This technology has an accuracy rate of 95%. Already products like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Assistant</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Alexa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siri</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Cortana</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are trending in the market.

<h2 id="step5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Social Selling &#8211; To Reach Broader Audience</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, considering the power of social networking in eCommerce is no more surprising! Most of the social media big players are offering some kind of eCommerce integration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see that Twitter is launching product pages. Instagram added a “shop now” button. Facebook now allows brands to use a “buy” button. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2017/Facebook-Reports-Third-Quarter-2017-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q3 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Facebook earned around $10.14 billion in advertising revenue alone. No wonder why brands see social media networks as a huge pool of potential customers today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How social media platforms attract brands? They offer different user targeting options to businesses. Also, if managed effectively, they offer businesses</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High levels of customization and consumer reach</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profitable conversion rates</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detailed reporting, and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High engagement rates</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, while scrolling through their feeds, customers have to leave the page to make a purchase. It creates friction in the buying process. You have to overcome this friction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can allow customers to click or swipe on your product straight from the feeds. And allow them to pay instantly. Thus, using social selling, you can increase the rates of impulse buys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistent social selling increases sales goals by 40% than non-social sellers. Also, it generates leads and creates a deeper relationship with customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is expected that by 2020, more brands will understand the importance of social selling. Just running Google Shopping ads is not enough anymore! So, make sure you are connecting sales to your social media account.</span></p>
<h2 id="step6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Holy Grail of Growth &#8211; Personalization</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization is about creating a personal experience for each consumer. It is usually done through tailored recommendations. Search queries, purchase history, geolocation, and browsing history are some of the aspects based on which tailored recommendation is done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, let’s take a look at some of the surprising stats on personalization.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of customers feel frustrated when website content is not personalized.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">81% of consumers want brands to get to know them. They expect brands to understand when to approach them and when not to.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">75% of consumers are more likely to buy from a retailer that recognizes them by name. Recommends options based on past purchases. Or knows their purchase history. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder why </span>personalization increases businesses’ profits by 15%<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, want to shine in eCommerce business? Embrace more personalization while approaching your customers.</span></p>
<h2 id="step7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Chatbots &#8211; The Ultimate Shopping Guide For Your Customer</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We already mentioned the role of Artificial Intelligence in the eCommerce business. Now, one of its successful implementations is chatbots. The successful implementation of chatbots makes your eCommerce business way smarter than your competitors. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10200" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chatbot.jpg" alt="chatbot" width="626" height="626" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots not only save time but also provide automated and fast answers to customers’ queries. Instead of waiting days for an assistant to call, customers get instant answers. Bei it early morning or midnight, customers never have to wait for answers. It undoubtedly offers great customer satisfaction. Thus, your business’s customer service reaches a new height! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, integrating chatbots in your </span><b>eCommerce trends 2019</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>-2020</strong> can save a lot of operational costs. How? Well, investing once in the chatbot integration is cheaper than hiring a dedicated worker. Businesses do not have to pay for overtime, sick time or vacation time then. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you already have not planned for it, it is high time to do so. Implement chatbots in your online store. And enjoy great ROI by improving your customer service and 24X7 availability. </span></p>
<h2 id="step8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Conversion Optimization &#8211; Product Page Vs Home Page</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, businesses have an obsession to design intriguing home pages. However, especially for eCommerce websites, putting a bit more emphasis on the internal pages can do wonders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason is quite simple. The homepage is more often seen by repeated visitors. Either they search your brand name in Google. Or they go directly to your website. The new visitors tend to land on internal service or product pages more frequently. Also, this is probably their first interaction with your brand. Hence, an impressive internal page design may turn your new visitors into regular customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put yourself in the customers&#8217; shoes. And design the product pages in the way your first-time visitors want to see it. A stellar first impression is crucial for increasing the conversion rate. Hence, put more efforts to optimize your internal product page designs. Thus, this is definitely going to be a major part of the </span><b>eCommerce web design trends 2019</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; 2020. </span></p>
<h2 id="step9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. The New Normal &#8211; Mobile Payments</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is no more a trend. But, mobile payments have become a necessity for today’s eCommerce businesses. According to a Statista report, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2021, 53.9% of all retail eCommerce is expected to be generated through mCommerce</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10201" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/online-payment.jpg" alt="online payment" width="1600" height="1067" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the rise of mCommerce is no more surprising. With the growing trend of smartphone usage and eCommerce mobile apps, we all knew this had to happen someday! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we all are aware of digital wallets like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Pay</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samsung Pay</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Pay</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Worldwide eCommerce businesses are widely implementing these digital wallets. All these digital services allow users to make purchases through electronic transactions. Undoubtedly, it allows more frictionless shopping experiences for the customers. Also, a market survey reported that </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/dell-technologies/the-economics-of-change/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of people expect that by 2030, digital payments will overtake cards and cash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, cryptocurrency is also cooking up a storm. Though we have not seen it being implemented by eCommerce businesses so far. Still, we can expect things can go this way soon! Well, definitely, maybe! </span></p>
<h2 id="step10"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Subscription-based Business Models</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. alone, 5.7 million subscription box shoppers are there! No doubt why subscription-based business models have become the new trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscription-based eCommerce has gained a lot of traction. The two main reasons for the demand for subscription-based eCommerce are as follows.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ease of automated monthly direct debit.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The excitement of monthly products delivered.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product subscription boxes are becoming fun these days. From makeup to pet products and from food boxes to shavers. The subscription-based eCommerce entices customers by offering personalized boxes right to their doors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, introducing a subscription element into your eCommerce business can be a game-changer! </span></p>
<h2>11. Bonus: eCommerce Web Design Trends</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, you saw the major eCommerce website development trends in 2020. Now, we are going to talk about some eCommerce web design trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the internet, a site is a business’s storefront. Especially for eCommerce businesses, it is crucial to attracting prospective customers. And ultimately turning them into paying customers. Just like a brick and mortar store, the designs and layouts of an online store play a game-changing role here. It can be the difference between turning a prospect into a potential customer. Or bouncing away in favor of a competitor! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital experience can dictate the entire experience a customer has with a business. So, you can afford to get left behind.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Mobile Era</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A huge percentage of online shoppers prefer using mobiles to shop. So, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">designers have to create e-commerce websites for mobile-first. And then only adapt to larger screens. In the coming years, we will see more mobile-friendly features. Card-like layouts, finger-friendly icons, and long scrolling pages will be seen on most of the eCommerce website themes. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Thumb Navigation for Mobile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As continued from the above point, the next eCommerce web design trend is obvious! Statistics show that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">94% of smartphone users hold their devices vertically</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hence, to facilitate thumb use, positioning the navigation buttons at the screen bottom will be a good practice. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Striking Colors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the use of white space and minimalistic design are already trending in the market. However, this year, we are probably going to see the experimental use of striking and bold colors in eCommerce web design trends 2019-2020. For eCommerce websites, the monochromatic design is not very appropriate. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Vintage Photography</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviving the vintage styles is one of the most trending eCommerce trends in recent days. In vintage photography, we can see the use of a muted color palette. This is reminiscent of the gritty, low-fi photography of the 70s. Also, colors are here imbued with more black than other modern styles. It heightens that dated look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, other than all these, you have to make sure your eCommerce site design implements the following points. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micro-interactions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more video content</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contextual logos</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storytelling approach, etc. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping Up</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no doubt that technology is evolving at a rapid pace. It is a great catalyst for both diversification and expansion of the eCommerce industry. So, implementing the ongoing technological trends in your online store can assure success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the eCommerce trends mentioned in this blog were derived from the success they have brought to many eCommerce sites.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As the world is gearing up for Christmas and the preparations for the grand celebrations are at its peak, a golden opportunity stands for e-commerce websites and online retailers to earn maximum revenue. The brick and mortar stores come lively in this part of the year as they decorate their stores with ballons and many other decorative items. Carrying the same philosophy forward, even online retail stores are going a step ahead in order to make their website look as if they are in a celebration mood. With less than a week left for the big day, retailers are preparing for the big day with their unique sales strategies. After doing an intensive research, we have come out with some e-commerce sales strategies that will help you earn the maximum revenue during Christmas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before we proceed further, we would like you to know that Rjmetrics, a research company found that e-commerce revenue reached the maximum during November and December in non-holiday months, apparels, accessories, and computers are the products that mainly drives holiday sales. Moreover, it also found out that Black Friday generates more revenue in comparison to other shopping days of the year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Strategy I &#8211; Give Your Website A Christmas Makeover</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just as you watch the stores decorated with mannequins of Santa Claus, Christmas trees decorated with colorful lights as you walk through the streets, in the same way, give a complete makeover even to your <a href="https://unifiedinfotech.wordpress.com/2015/09/28/online-shopping-is-the-buzz-in-the-upcoming-holidays/" target="_blank">online store</a>. Make use of festive colors such as red, white, green and yellow in order to make your website look more attractive. Make use of buttons and links and make it more interactive. Your homepage is the first thing that appears when a user opens your website. Hence, keep the home page as attractive as possible. Go for Magento based themes and make your store look creative and unique. You can also take the help of a designer who works in an <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/" target="_blank"><strong>e-commerce web development company</strong></a> to get an idea about website design during Christmas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Strategy II &#8211; Announce Free Delivery On All Products</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you really want customers to keep coming back to your website especially during Christmas, then follow the golden rule of announcing free delivery on all your products or if you can also announce a special free delivery offer for purchasing a particular product above a specific price then nothing works better than this. It is ok to sacrifice a bit of margin in order to get the maximum return from the purchases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Strategy III &#8211; Make Your Page Keyword Specific</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to get your website noticed especially during Christmas, then make sure that the keywords are optimized according to the most searched items during this time. Merely inserting keywords won’t solve the purpose, use the appropriate keywords in headlines related to Christmas. According to a <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/5-holiday-shopping-trends-to-watch-in-2015/" target="_blank">research</a>, 53% people will log on to <a href="https://unified-infotech.blogspot.com/2015/06/5-ways-to-make-your-ecommerce-shipping.html" target="_blank">online shopping</a> website through mobile in 2015, hence also optimize your website so that it is easily accessible even through the mobile phone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Strategy IV &#8211; Take Advantage Of Last Minute Shopping</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if there is only a week left for Christmas, then don’t worry, you can even announce the last minute shopping offer now. All you have to do is ensure that you deliver the product to the customer before Christmas. Remember, the trend of an increase in sales starts from the Thanks Giving Day and it continues for many days. Hence, you can continue with your Christmas Campaign and get plenty of orders from customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Strategy V – Take the Help of Social Media</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spread awareness about the special Christmas offer through social media whether it is Facebook, Google+ or Twitter. Let the word spread among everybody. Blog about Christmas and any other thing related to gifting ideas. For instance: take a topic that says, “What to gift your sweetheart this Christmas?” These topics will spark interest among the readers and they will come to your website. Moreover, solve any queries or problems related to the product and the customers will surely come to your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. Strategy VI – Take the Help of Paid Marketing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During Christmas, people tend to scroll more than a million websites in order to find the best Christmas deals. If your website has the best deal to offer, then don’t limit yourself in terms of marketing. Take the help of paid marketing in order to reach the right kind of target audience Take help of the Google Analytics tool to filter your audience in terms of demographics, age, location and then plan the marketing strategy of your product. You can also take the help of Facebook Page ads in order to get maximum visitors to your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. Strategy VII – Be Clear About Your Product’s Return Policy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Communicate clearly about the return policy of the product along with the payment option. You might want to reconsider these options due to the special holiday season, but at the same time also keep in mind about the consumer’s psyche. There are a number of online stores that offer exchange and extended return policy, therefore, you need to plan out your return policy so that the deal is always more attractive than others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are thinking that the strategies end here, then you are wrong. We have come up with some more creative strategies</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>a&gt;</i> While offering discounts, don’t reduce the price of the product too much as it can have a negative effect on your brand value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>b&gt;</i> Have post-Christmas Deals in January in order to keep your customers coming to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>c&gt;</i> All the vouchers you offer must have the option of redeeming so that people keep coming back to your online store.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>d&gt;</i> Keep updating your customer about their product’s delivery time. The purpose is to have faith on you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>e&gt;</i> Keep the option of fast delivery in order to assure the customers that the product will be delivered before Christmas.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know, if you do not have a smooth payment gateway, then it can drive your buyers away? The complex payment gateway asking too many details about customer puts off anybody who comes to your website, shopping for his or her favourite product. If you are planning to start your online store, then keep in mind that a payment gateway is one of the most important areas where you should concentrate. Make the payment process hassle free, so that customers don’t have a tiring experience while making the payment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/" target="_blank">Any e-commerce web development company</a> wants a good reputation among its customers. A smooth payment gateway is vital for any business that wants to stay longer in the market. UIPL recommends six types of payment gateways that will help you to decide the best payment gateway for your e-commerce website.</p>
<h2>Hosted Payment Gateways</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, the customer is redirected to a third party website of the payment service provider once he or she clicks the ‘Pay Now’ button. He needs to fill in important details such as ‘Name on card,’ ‘Expiry Date,’ ‘CVV.’ Once he fills the details, a One Time Password (OTP) is sent to the customer, once this process is done, the customer will again be redirected to that particular online shopping website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">iFrame or inline Frame is another payment gateway. Here, a link is created by the payment service provider to the merchants. The customers do not have to insert any details. All they have to do is fill up a form and the PSP automatically transfers the data. In case, the customer has any outstanding payments to make, the PSP creates a profile of the specific customer and goes on deducting the recurring amount while sending notifications to the website from where he or she purchased the product.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Benefits to the merchant</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. All details of the cardholder are captured by PSP</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. The logo of the merchant’s business can be attached in the payment page</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. The PSP takes care of the payment set up</p>
<h2>Self Hosted Payment Gateways</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, the customer is not redirected to any third party website. All the details are taken by the e-commerce website itself. After this, the data is sent to the URL of the payment gateway. This is done by either sending the data in a specific format or by sending any secret code. Any outstanding payment from the customer’s side is debited by the payment gateway. As soon as this is done, a notification is sent to the e-commerce website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Benefits to the merchant</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. the way a customer navigates through the website till the checkout process in order to get an idea about the things that a customer looks for when he or she visits a website for the first time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Get insight about the customer’s shopping preference.</p>
<h2>Non-Hosted Payment Gateways</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want your customers to enter their details in your website, then Non-Hosted Payment Gateways are something, which you should opt for. Also known as API, here any information of the customer related to the transaction can be accessed on the web page itself. This is done with the help of API. Based on the information provided by the customer regarding his payment details, payment calls are made after which notifications are sent to the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Benefits to the merchants:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. View the User Interface of the payment page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Enhanced customer experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Connect internet payment solution with mobile phones, tablets or any kind of technological device that can access an e-commerce website.</p>
<h2>Direct Payment Gateway</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many payment processors that do not give instant payment notification. The amount is debited from the user’s debit or credit card without informing the system. Only a notification of the credit card’s approval is generated. In this situation, the system constantly updates the payment processor whether the payment is received or not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Benefits to the merchants:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The user is not redirected to any payment gateway.</p>
<h2>Platform Based Payment Gateway Solutions</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an excellent platform for selling your goods directly from the server itself. After the users have selected the items they want to purchase, customers need to subscribe themselves first and then they are redirected to the checkout button. The purchase can be completed in any language or currency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Benefits to the merchants:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Improve the conversion of buyers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Shows the price as well as currency of the shopper. You will get an idea about the geographic location of your buyers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Receive foreign payments according to the latest exchange rates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The above mentioned payment gateways will help you to decide which is the one that suits your business need, but before deciding the payment gateways there are a number of factors that you have to keep in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Know the transaction fees charged by the payment gateway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Do not opt for any kind of payment gateways that asks you to register yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Always choose a payment gateway that accepts multiple currencies. This is applicable only when your business is spread in more than one country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. Read the terms and conditions of the payment gateway carefully. Check what type of products you can sell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Check and make sure the payment gateway you have selected does not ask people to fill a plenty of personal details. This will certainly drive away visitors from the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. Your payment gateway must accept Credit Card, Debit Card and Paypal payments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A payment gateway plays a vital role in any business. The customers must rely on you when it comes to payment. At the same time, a safe and secure payment process will always make your customers coming back to your website. The concept of e-commerce is developing day by day and in the near future it is expected to increase. With the growth of internet penetration and tech-savvy population all over the world, e-commerce will certainly flourish. Along with this, payment gateway will also gain much <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/e-commerce-web-development-design-trends-for-2017/" target="_blank">importance while creating an e-commerce website</a> because this is one of the key factors for developing customer reputation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Must be convenient enough to add coupons</strong> – Many customers visit the websites due to coupons. Customers are sure to download an app that promises a discount coupon. What will happen if they provide you with a coupon but not a place to apply it? So the app must have convenient places to apply it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Abandoning the shopping cart</strong> – From the toddlers to juggernaut everyone faces the issue of abandoned cart.

So, always provide a scope to provide a review or give feedback on all products. It helps the users to take a completely informed decision.</p>

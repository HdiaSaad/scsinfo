										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online shopping has become a common practice around the world. But the significance of ecommerce future trends have come to the forefront especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. When quarantine and work-from-home became the new normal in 2020, businesses and emerging ecommerce companies had no choice but to go digital. This has contributed to e-commerce’s share of global retail trade from 14% in 2019 to about 17% in 2020.</span> (source: <a href="https://unctad.org/news/how-covid-19-triggered-digital-and-e-commerce-turning-point">Unctad</a>)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to research by Statista, e-commerce’s share of total retail sales in the US surged from 11% in 2019 to 14% in 2020. Since then, there has been no turning back for these businesses.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13428 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-924x1024.jpg" alt="e-commerce’s share of total retail sales" width="924" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-924x1024.jpg 924w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-271x300.jpg 271w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-768x851.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-1387x1536.jpg 1387w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01.jpg 1671w" sizes="(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="id_1">1. Taking Your E-Commerce Game Up a Notch</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With new trends enhancing e-commerce, online <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/customer-experience-design-secrets/">customer experience</a> (CX) and store engagement have become intimately tied to business outcomes. Customers have high standards and have become particular regarding their expectations from brands. So, if your website is not appealing, 38% of users will stop engaging with your content.</span> (Source: <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/compelling-stats-website-design-optimization-list">Hubspot</a>)</p>
<h3>So, how should you build a robust website/apps that also converts?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We at SCS INFO have helped our clients to digitally transform themselves using the best practices while staying ahead of the competition. To know more, please see our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/">ecommerce website development services</a> (web/apps, saas development) &#8211; 1200+ solutions delivered for small and medium businesses, funded startups, enterprises, and Fortune 500 clients globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To augment your website’s UX+CX and achieve your business goals across all the stages of the customer journey i.e. from lead generation to conversion, customer engagement and loyalty, we have listed some b2b e-commerce trends:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR to Boost Customer Experience (CX)</strong> &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital platforms are using augmented reality to empower consumers’ shopping experience. Now, shoppers can get a preview of products and services in real-time through the ‘try on’ or ‘view’ feature. </span>The beauty and cosmetic industry is leveraging the power of augmented reality (AR) to transform the e-shopping experience. With the help of AR, consumers can virtually full-fill makeup applications to mimic how they would try cosmetics on at a traditional brick and mortar store.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> – With the help of AI, companies can deliver hyper-personalized and enriching customer experiences.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are two of the most powerful AI powered ecommerce future trends that can skyrocket your top of the funnel (TOF):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Voice Commerce Powering CX</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Why type when you could easily voice your query? If an e-commerce store does not have a digital assistant, this can be a major drop-off point for users. They will get tired of typing out their queries as it slows down their shopping experience. An Emarketer survey revealed that 40% of internet users in the US use voice search. Evidently, businesses can leverage the ‘voice-to-cart’ technology to boost a website’s engagement rate and sales.</span></li>
<li><b>Customer Service Chatbots</b> &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer assistance chatbots can really help to convert visitors into customers. Like in-store salespeople, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/chatbot-can-use-business/">chatbots help consumers</a> complete their purchase and offer after-sales support. This is a way for businesses and emerging e-commerce companies to communicate with customers (including communication using regional languages) and resolve their issues then and there. In fact, 40% of millennials say that they use chatbots daily as they provide answers instantly.</span> (Source: <a href="https://www.slicktext.com/blog/2020/04/chatbot-statistics/">Slicktext</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Big Data for Personalized Experience</strong>&#8211; Online stores do not have retail salespeople to recommend products or answer shoppers’ queries. That is why it is crucial to have human touchpoints in a customer’s journey on e-commerce platforms. To mimic a user&#8217;s personalized in-store experience, online retailers are extracting customers’ information through their social media, browsing behavior, and prior buying patterns. Successful e-commerce brands are leveraging analytics to make UX data-driven and target consumers with exactly what they desire and even more.</li>
<li><b>Headless Commerce: A Solution to Increase Sales</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headless commerce is the separation of the front end i.e. the marketplace, user interface, graphics from the back-end that manages the product details and the portal&#8217;s entire functioning. This allows e-commerce website development companies being more creative, allowing freedom and flexibility to offer unique and personalized services to customers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8vZbbsCbVU8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2 id="id_2">2. Conclusion: E-Commerce UX Trends Are Here to Stay</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging ecommerce future trends have gained a lot of traction in 2021 already, driving more traffic to businesses and converting them into potential customers. The pandemic has made us realize how powerful e-commerce is. In fact, it is predicted by Nasdaq that by 2040, 95% of purchases will be through e-commerce platforms.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopping is actually very similar to farming a field. You can&#8217;t keep buying the same thing, you have to have a bit of variety. Otherwise, you get bored and stop enjoying yourself.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">― </span><b>Sophie Kinsella, </b><b>Confessions of a Shopaholic</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The celebrated quote encapsulates the modern thought about eCommerce very well. Let’s face it- the world right now is full of virtual stores. We can find an online shop on every corner of the internet. And in this densely populated virtual shopping world, a digital shopping platform needs the most unique experience on it to stand out!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And no, we don’t say it from basic knowledge, but from real-life understanding. While working with our London based client for a digital commerce channel, we at SCS INFO indulged in a new vision- of an eCommerce website that unlike any other in the virtual shopping landscape.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We are not going to keep our wisdom and experience a secret. Being the good Samaritans, we’re about to share our experience and process of completely innovating the eCommerce experience on our client platform. So without delay, let’s begin!</span></p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Client’s Vision, Our Sacred Mission</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our esteemed client located in London approached us with the simple requirement of an eCommerce platform creation. However, it was not exactly that simple.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12990 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/client-vision-point.jpg" alt="client vision point" width="825" height="879" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/client-vision-point.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/client-vision-point-282x300.jpg 282w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/client-vision-point-768x818.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their vibrant vision was all about reinventing the web shopping experience for the fashionable millennial and Gen Z who are always on the lookout for new websites that can satiate their need of keeping up with the hottest trends.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vibrant concept did come with its challenges. But when it comes to innovation, team SCS INFO doesn’t let anything stop them! And that’s why we</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while taking pride in being one of the </span><a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/ecommerce/new-york/new-york-city"><b>Top Casablanca eCommerce Development Agencies</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bore down on the process of building such a novel eCommerce platform that will soon become one of the dominating forces in the industry of fashion eCommerce. </span></p>

<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determining Objectives For A Captivating Site</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We began the endeavor with the main objectives. Not only this happens to be part of our main work process, but based on the newfangled requirements of this new platform, we recalibrated our R&amp;D process to match the goals. And to do that, these objectives assisted us a lot.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the main objectives we started with-</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refashion the eCommerce experience, ensuring that the platform is unmatched in its superiority in the modern industry landscape. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase website ROI and engagement levels through the implementations of the right design and business components on the interface. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplifying shopping and payment practices to boost the efficacy of the platform. </span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping the three objectives mentioned above we began our research process. A point to be noted, our research process in this case was not only limited to the in-depth market and demographic research. To accommodate the exemplary demands, our team went beyond the normalized scope of research and delved deeper into technology and design psychology research as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for this research process expansion is simple- to ensure a completely original type of positive experience; we aimed to introduce some new kinds of tech and design. And for that, we pulled in various resources and references to create a complete experience on the site that goes beyond what is called ‘normal’.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges Never Seen Before!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique opportunities come with unique challenges. And this time was no different. From the beginning, we were confronted by various predicament never before experienced in all our years of experience in developing state-of-the-art digital solutions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what were these formidable challenges?</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First challenge was demographics. The target demographic was a mix of millennials and Gen Z, and everyone in the design world knows that this demographic is the hardest to please.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second challenge was all about transformation. Devising a strategy to keep the finicky audience on the site long enough to transform them was a tough task (but we accomplished it anyway!)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crafting a content strategy that is light and breezy, but valuable enough for the users.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an ideal buyer support channel for the DIY generation.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining the client&#8217;s aspirations and demographic demands was not exactly easy. But our </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile work practices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the versatile teams of experts put all their minds and skills on the table to make this impossible task possible.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The One Plan To Rule The Whole Process</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A plan is necessary for successful process execution. And that’s why after we were done with the research phase, we collected all the data and collaborated with the client to create a plan that fits the goals and speed up the entire operation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every aspect of the whole operation was recorded within this plan. Leaving nothing to chance or assumptions, the plan guided each step of the procedure till we had a complete and flawless product ready to go live. From the design requirements to tech stack and security necessities, we ensured all of it was included and outlined in the plan. </span></p>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Our Discovery Phase: The Key To Successful Development</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our unrivaled remedy for the eCommerce platform in the discussion is the result of a long and in-depth exploration and examination phase. This step in our process is dedicated to documenting the client’s goals in detail and conducting research to find data and related information that helped us to bring those goals to reality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the minute details had a major significance for us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our in-house team of experts, owing to their long term association with us as one of the </span><a href="https://www.bestdesigns.co/magazine-ad-design"><b>Top Casablanca Digital Agencies</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offering eCommerce solutions, prioritizes each detail. The team then executed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">various research into the sector of fashion eCommerce, and then specifically on the user demographic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a fragmented target clientele of 17-24 and 25-36, the eCommerce platform required special attention to design and feature details. Keeping that in mind, we gathered as much data as possible to create a robust plan that will be applied in the later stages of the development. Based on a combination of the data and client discussion, we drafted a scheme that included clientage persona, guide, and other particulars. Let’s take a look at some of the crucial bits in that plan!</span></p>
<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. The Unified Design Thinking</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being experienced in creating diverse types of digital solutions, we have some curated in-house design methods. These methods are easy to modify based on the specific requirements of the clients.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design objective in this scenario was one-of-a-kind! The main demographic consisted of fashion-concerned millennials and Gen Z who are extremely critical of any kind of digital platform. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To satisfy these critical audiences, we had to bring out the aces in our sleeves, i.e. </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/web-design-for-millennial-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our process of designing for the millennial generation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the millennial design tricks, we also had to start with a buyer model. With this neat process, the SCS INFO design team gained a better perception of the main audience for this site and the kind of eCommerce solutions they want. Needless to say, once we had the persona in hand, designing and implementing the right features was a cakewalk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12991 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/buyer-persona-1024x742.jpg" alt="buyer persona" width="1024" height="742" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/buyer-persona-1024x742.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/buyer-persona-300x217.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/buyer-persona-768x556.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/buyer-persona.jpg 1111w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on this persona, we focused on some specific areas of design that seemed to be significant to impress the patrons. Let us tell you about what these aspects are and how we implemented them into the platform. </span></p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Our Responsive Approach</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The efficiency of shopping from phones is undeniably popular now. And that’s why the responsive approach was the first thing we started with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12992 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/responsive-ecommerce-design.jpg" alt="responsive e-commerce design" width="825" height="624" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/responsive-ecommerce-design.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/responsive-ecommerce-design-300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/responsive-ecommerce-design-768x581.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During research and analysis, we came across the client organization’s Google analytics data that showed us that almost </span><b>35% of target customers are visiting the site from mobile</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Keeping that data in mind, we picked a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> responsive minimalist </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">outline that looks and functions well no matter what device is being used.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Revolutionizing The Design </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The particular aesthetic conditions of the demographic needed to be fulfilled flawlessly. And that’s why we crafted a complete design guide, that outlines how the site needs to look and feel for the users.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12993 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/style-guide.jpg" alt="style guide" width="825" height="879" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/style-guide.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/style-guide-282x300.jpg 282w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/style-guide-768x818.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, meeting these conditions is not the only objective. In order to carve out a space for themselves in the crowded marketplace, our client needed a distinct identity. Our design team at SCS INFO facilitated this requirement with the definitive design-manual approach. This guide incorporates all design components of the site that will make up the organization&#8217;s identity.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating A Hierarchy Of Content</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the content hierarchy of the eCommerce platform seems a little confusing. That&#8217;s why we set out to construct a wireframe that outlines the content hierarchy of the site. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12994 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/content-hierarchy.jpg" alt="content hierarchy" width="825" height="788" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/content-hierarchy.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/content-hierarchy-300x287.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/content-hierarchy-768x734.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the biggest of headlines to the smallest footnotes, the content frame included all and helped to create an interface that is easy to understand and navigate.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imbibing The Sense Of Trust</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our effort to make the design trustworthy has two reasons-</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Firstly, the target viewers the platform deals with is well aware of the dark design practices. Any shady element on the platform will repel them for good and will make it hard to retain patrons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Transparency is one of our main design objectives. We are always aiming to craft aesthetics for digital solutions that provide real utility rather than duping people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12995 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/honesty-trust-in-design-point.jpg" alt="honesty trust in design point" width="825" height="788" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/honesty-trust-in-design-point.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/honesty-trust-in-design-point-300x287.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/honesty-trust-in-design-point-768x734.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce sites happen to be the main ground for all kinds of ill-design practice. And that’s why we were careful in integrating elements that invoke a positive feeling. And to accomplish this, we used a carefully constructed content strategy that set the atmosphere of fun and enjoyment on the website.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_6" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. The Features That Made The Platform A Success!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a big believer in the fact that the right features can change the ROI of the platform. Keeping the unique objectives of both the business and the consumers, we drafted and implemented the following features on the platform that ensure better results.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Feature Of Reliability: Product Description</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product specifications help the visitants to make quick judgments and get along with the buying process. And that’s why we gave special attention to this feature.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12996 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/produc_description-feature.jpg" alt="product description feature" width="825" height="810" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/produc_description-feature.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/produc_description-feature-300x295.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/produc_description-feature-768x754.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A clear and visible description on the site is a mandatory feature to integrate.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Reaching The Height Of Personalization With Recommendations</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization is key, and suggestions are the perfect tool to implement it. We integrated the AI/ML systems that examined visitor behavior, browsing activity, and shopping history to promote the products they might be interested in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12997 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/produc_recommendation.jpg" alt="product recommendation" width="825" height="1118" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/produc_recommendation.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/produc_recommendation-221x300.jpg 221w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/produc_recommendation-756x1024.jpg 756w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/produc_recommendation-768x1041.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this feature, we streamlined the process for the users, ensuring that there remain no glitches in the browsing and shopping activities.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Building The Right Kind Of Cart</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning, our SCS INFO team aimed to enhance the cart experience. With ample investigation, we recognized the normal shortcomings of the cart functionality on existing platforms and worked to eliminate them from the new platform altogether. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12998 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shopping-cart.jpg" alt="shopping cart" width="825" height="543" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shopping-cart.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shopping-cart-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shopping-cart-768x505.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Clever CTAs For Right Engagement</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attraction and engagement on online platforms are all about the right elements, and no one does it better than us. We implemented interactive elements such as CTAs and forms that will hook the users to the site and keep them browsing forever. Bonus factor: the longer the users stay on the site, the better chances of retention.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12999 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CTA.jpg" alt="Call to action" width="825" height="575" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CTA.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CTA-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CTA-768x535.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Avant-Garde Bots For DIY Help!</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The millennial and Gen Z are quite popular in wanting to solve problems without any outside help. So we had to find a way that helps the visitants to resolve any matter on their own, but at the same time reach out to the support executives without having to stay on call forever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why we utilized the sophisticated Chatbot feature. These bots permit the visitants to get the answer to queries without having to scramble around for the Q&amp;A section. At the same time, the bots can always link up with an executive through the inbox in case of a more grievous matter. </span></p>

<h2 id="id_7" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Finding The Tech Stack: Our Expert Choices</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A platform that seeks to reinvent the entire fashion shopping activity needs the right kind of tech stack. And that’s why the specialist team members at SCS INFO put all their heart and mind into determining the ideal tech stack for it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following tech stack for the multinational eCommerce platform was chosen with a lot of factors in mind, and the high quality of the performance was one of them. The in-house experts ensured that the tech stack is flexible and supports the future growth of the platform. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13000 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/techstack-table-1024x630.jpg" alt="techstack table" width="1024" height="630" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/techstack-table-1024x630.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/techstack-table-300x185.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/techstack-table-768x473.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/techstack-table.jpg 1111w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The combination of the open-source solution and database/cloud storage framework ensured great performance, as well as flexibility for future changes. This tech stack has made it easier for the client to keep up with the recent advancements in the technology sector.</p>
<h2 id="id_8" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. Our Testing Process To Improve Quality</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no way we were going to let the site go live without proper performance and immunity testing. Our work process at SCS INFO adheres to strict testing procedures. During these tests, our in-house security and tech experts collaborated with the testing team to improve the quality of the site. Here are the two most essential tests the site went through to ensure its quality. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Security Testing</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of this practice is to secure every aspect of the site. And that’s why our in-house testing team conducted a series of security examinations on the site to recognize and eradicate any persisting security issues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through static and dynamic testing the initial vulnerabilities on the site were exposed during this phase. These frailties were then resolved by the in-house developers with the utmost precision. Only when we were sure about the impeccable quality of the platform we launched it into the market.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Load &amp; Stress Testing</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Load and stress testing put the site through a full quality check. With this method, the expert testers put the platform under the envisioned load to observe how well it is able to handle it. For any shortcomings, we made quick recalibration until the platform provided quality service.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During stress testing, we went a step ahead and put the site under more traffic than it can handle. Based on the results, we made the necessary changes to sharpen the functionality of the site.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Time To Start Talking About Your Ecommerce Endeavor</span></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s 2020, and we are all aware of the existence of eCommerce marketplaces. Platforms like Amazon, eBay have shown us how eCommerce platforms can earn a huge amount of success and revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many have ventured into the eCommerce industry, hoping to become an extraordinary example like the ones we mentioned already. However, they can have a little hard time choosing the right method to create marketplace with Magento or equivalent technology.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">An eCommerce platform can be developed in two ways-</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From scratch (using PHP, Python, ROR, to build the backend.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With open-source eCommerce platforms (e.g: Magento, Shopify, WordPress, etc. )</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both methods have their own merits, we have to consider the lack of resources of eCommerce startups. Developing an eCommerce platform from scratch takes a lot of time and costs a lot. This is why for startups it is better to choose a development with open source eCommerce platforms with options like Magento Marketplace.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is Magento the right choice for marketplace development? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s find out in the following steps:</span></p>
<ol class="scrollspy-links">
<li><a href="#step1">Valid reasons why you should choose open-source Magento</a></li>
<li><a href="#step2">How strong is the Magento architecture</a></li>
<li><a href="#step3">Popular application and modification of the MVC architecture</a></li>
<li><a href="#step4">Types of Magento Marketplace you should know about</a></li>
<li><a href="#step5">Must-have features for MVC Magento marketplace development</a></li>
<li><a href="#step6">Technology Stack to know about</a></li>
<li><a href="#step7">Magento community vs enterprise edition &#8211; A comparison</a></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this article, we are going to talk about developing your eCommerce marketplace with the help of Magento. But before we get to that, we need to talk about why you should create marketplace with Magento. </span></p>
<h2 id="step1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Reasons Why You Should Choose Open-source Magento?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many industry specialists will prefer developing an eCommerce platform from scratch, for startups it can be very problematic. This method not only costs more but it also takes up a lot of time and effort. For a startup with a limited budget, this can harm the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing <a href="https://magento.com/products/magento-open-source">open-source Magento</a>, on the other hand, will save a lot of development time as well as save budget. There are, however, a few more reasons for choosing Magento. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Responsive Development</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magento is a platform specifically created to develop a mobile responsive eCommerce marketplace. The </span><a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/magento/new-york/new-york-city"><b>Top Casablanca Magento Development Agencies</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ensured that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> any kind of marketplace created using this platform is accessible through all types of devices. </span></p>

</div>
</div>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. A Versatile Content Management System</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Magento, the shop owners are able to use the visual page editors to edit their product pages easily without any fuss. Even those who are less talented with coding are easily able to optimize the interface to be a user-friendly one. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Building A Spacious And Powerful Ecommerce Marketplace</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://growthhackers.com/articles/benefits-of-magento-as-marketplace-solution">A Magento 2 marketplace website is capable of supporting up to 500,000 products and handles about 80,000 products</a> every hour. This powerful and spacious quality of the marketplace websites makes it ready for future growth. However, the complexity of the size and the website creates special hosting needs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Browsing Related Products Easily</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easy to add the feature of browsing related products with Magento. This does not only enhances the UX but also improves sales. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Third-party Integrations Made Easy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magento makes it easy for developers to integrate third-party tools such as Paypal, Mailchimp, etc. It also allows for third-party tools integration for website data analysis. Hence it is easy if you create marketplace with Magento.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">f. Customizable Security Options</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/">When developing eCommerce websites</a> using Magento, the developers can customize the security of their eCommerce websites. Adding multiple levels of security using Magento is easy. The marketplace building platform comes with standard PCI data security, captcha enabled login screens, and for additional security a secondary password prompt. Magento also makes vendor management easy, for a secure shopping environment for the customers. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">g. Support Of A Huge Community</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubt that a huge community is already using Magento to create and maintain the marketplace website. You can find Magento developers spread worldwide, capable of creating an amazing eCommerce website, all thanks to the support of the huge community. </span></p>
<h2 id="step2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. A Quick Look At Magento Architecture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magento architecture is a mix between the Zend framework and the MVC architecture. This combination offers users unlimited control and flexibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is based on the Zend framework, the codebase is not only secure but scalable as well. Zend Framework comes with an object-oriented library of codes that provide better support for the developers. The code used to build Magento has three specific quality to it-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Flexibility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a marketplace with Magento ensures that the customization of the platform remains smooth. The code used to develop Magento is quite flexible and easy to modify, making the platform easy to scale in the future. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Scalability</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as Magento’s code can be customized, it still remains upgradeable, which means that using Magento for eCommerce marketplace development will make sure that the website can be upgraded as the business grows. </span></p>

</div>
</div>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Speed and security</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magento code is the top of the market when it comes to speed and security. The developers applied best practices to increase the flow and efficiency of the website and the online store. </span></p>
<h2 id="step3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Application And Modification Of The MVC Architecture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Magento architecture does follow the MVC pattern, it also adds some of its own modifications to it as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple MVC structure divides up the codes into three parts- Model ( the main application), View (the reusable objects on the interface used by the Controller to perform tasks) and Controller ( how the model is presented to the user) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Controller is asked to perform a task, it employes Model to process data and puts forth the results using the view. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magento, on the other hand, has added some additional sun-blocks to the traditional MVC structure. This modification helps Magento to support bigger eCommerce marketplace systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we can see from the image above, the Model in Magento’s MVC structure is divided into two parts and the View is divided into three structures. The helpers are in this case module-specific. This doesn’t only help the developers to manage a complex eCommerce system, but also helps the website to grow with the business. </span></p>
<h2 id="step4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Marketplace Types</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we start talking about the development and features, you need to choose what type of marketplace you want to build. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to Magento marketplace development, there are two types you can go with. The first is a single vendor marketplace and the second is multi-vendor marketplaces. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Single Vendor Marketplace</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The single vendor marketplaces usually represent a website where a single company, sells its products. This can be either a B2B marketplace built using Magento or a simple B2C eCommerce website.  In this scenario, there are only two parties involved, the buyers and the sellers. These stand-alone websites will be perfect for you if you have a business that makes a specific brand of products and wants to sell that one particular website, avoiding competition. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Multi-Vendor Marketplace</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-vendor marketplaces such as Amazon, or eBay have a number of vendors selling various products on one platform. In the case of a multi-vendor platform, we have three kinds of users, system admin, vendor, and the end-user or customer. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12091" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12091" style="width: 920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12091 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP-Multi-Vendor-M2_1_.png" alt="create marketplace with magento for multi vendor " width="920" height="700" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP-Multi-Vendor-M2_1_.png 920w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP-Multi-Vendor-M2_1_-300x228.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP-Multi-Vendor-M2_1_-768x584.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12091" class="wp-caption-text">Source: ommunity.magento.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vendor sells products through its separate panels. The admin panel is used to manage the vendor and customer activity on the platform. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have made the decision to build your eCommerce marketplace with Magento, you have to choose which version you want to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to choosing Magento versions, there are two types- Magento Community Edition and Magento Enterprise Edition. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12094" style="width: 1499px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12094 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/difference-between-magento-community-and-enterprise-version-min-1.jpg" alt="create marketplace with magento with this comparison" width="1499" height="1747" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/difference-between-magento-community-and-enterprise-version-min-1.jpg 1499w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/difference-between-magento-community-and-enterprise-version-min-1-257x300.jpg 257w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/difference-between-magento-community-and-enterprise-version-min-1-768x895.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/difference-between-magento-community-and-enterprise-version-min-1-879x1024.jpg 879w" sizes="(max-width: 1499px) 100vw, 1499px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12094" class="wp-caption-text">Source: community.magento.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The community edition is the free edition that anyone can use to create a marketplace with Magento. It needs zero investment, which is why it has become quite popular among eCommerce startups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magento Enterprise Edition or Magento Commerce is the paid version perfect for big and medium marketplace development. So which one to choose? Which one will be perfect for you? Let’s find out. Here are some major comparisons between the two editions to understand which one you will need for your business. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Requirements</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need a robust security system backing your eCommerce website, then choosing the Magento Enterprise solution would be a better idea for you. When it comes to security, the enterprise edition is far ahead of the free edition. With Magento enterprise edition you will get access to secure payment gateways, regular scanning for any kind of security breaches, external penetration testings, and many other security supports. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance Quality</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your eCommerce website is a small one with fewer resources on it, choosing the Community version would be better for you, as it provides faster performance to small marketplace websites. And if you are still in need of better functionalities, then you can just add the third party Magento marketplace extensions to your website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if your website happens to be a bigger one with numerous resources and handling a lot of orders and traffic, choosing the Magento Enterprise edition would be a better decision. With the enterprise edition, you will get many additional features such as deploying your software through the Enterprise cloud to increase the deployment speed.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scope For Future Growth</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you make the choice, you have to consider the business requirements for the future. If you want to grow your eCommerce platform in the future and offer a number of products from more than one vendor, then you should definitely choose the Enterprise edition. It is built to be scalable and support the future growth of the business. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Difference Between Functionality</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There isn’t much difference between the Community and the enterprise edition. Both these versions offer the same functionalities such as RMA functionality, Customer segmentation, content staging, Advanced ACL and many more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only difference, however, is the fact that with enterprise version you get access to additional features. So if you want to take advantage of the additional functionalities of the enterprise version, then you should choose the Magento Enterprise version. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Which One Should You Choose to Create Marketplace With Magento?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer to the question is pretty simple. If you are just getting started with the eCommerce platform, choosing the Magento Community edition is going to be the right decision. It’s affordable and easy to integrate, therefore perfect for a brand new small startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you are starting out a new business and plan on expanding it, even more, investing in the enterprise version will be a better idea. The additional features of this version will make it easy for your business to scale in the future. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of modern eCommerce marketplace websites has certainly become popular and profitable.

<p style="text-align: justify;">For this reason, it’s important to choose which platform allows selling your products in the best possible manner. Many E-Commerce development platforms give free trials before availing their service</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is some e-commerce platform to check out:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> LemonStand</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Magento</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Shopify</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> BigCommerce</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> WooCommerce</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2. Operating Without Strategy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You should never waste your valuable time and other resources on running your business without any strategy. Be a smart entrepreneur and make a detailed strategy for your venture and in the best interest of your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For drafting strategy, you can follow these points to get a good start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Recognize your market and buyers</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Make every process see-through</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Ask customers to leave feedbacks</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Plan accordingly to ensure smooth supply management</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Plan to offer continuous service and support</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Target mobile audience</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Categorization and Merchandising Mistakes</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the time merchants and business owners makes mistakes by adding too many or too few category pages.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Along these lines, the details obviously show that you have a limited ability to focus 15 seconds to persuade guests to make a buy from your site. Be that as it may, everything depends on clients&#8217; aim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this circumstance, popups come without hesitation as it empowers you to catch data from your guests, for example, an email address. If you prevail at catching their messages, then you can tempt them with some energizing offers conveyed to their inbox so they visit your site once more.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">7. Depriving Your Customers of Free Shipping</h3>

What&#8217;s more, if you offer the same, then it could enhance your deals drastically. While the individuals who don&#8217;t, are probably going to face high shopping cart abandonment rates.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">8. No Search Engine Optimization Strategy</h3>

With the goal for you to be recorded in an initial couple of pages of the search results, you should have a strong SEO plan your site. Site design improvement is about more than catchphrases; it additionally concentrates on how your site is constructed, how pictures are labeled and what information is parsed via search bots that direct those ludicrously quick searches.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">9. Poor Site Navigation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There aren&#8217;t an excessive number of things that can debilitate a buyer speedier than poor navigation. Elusive data, an absence of catches and excessively numerous text style sorts and hues all prompt client disappointment and frequently no deal.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The logistic industry is immensely going through a time of rapid transformation.

Moreover, 3D printing, drone technology, Internet of Things (IoT) and augmented reality are no longer a thing of science fiction. Today’s industries are cautious in adopting these latest technologies to provide cheaper, faster, sustainable and more reliable delivery. Both manufacturers and retailers are also not wasting time and using 3PL logistic providers to integrate these technologies into their service.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">“Innovate or die” Will Become Reality</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The “innovate or die&#8221; platitude will end up being a dismal reality for a few, as no less than one surely understood retailer. What has dependably worked in the past won&#8217;t keep on working later and grasping capricious deduction will turn into a trademark quality for effective organizations in 2017. Similarly, Organizations will have compelled to assess their supply chains and discuss old fashioned and wasteful procedures. Cases incorporate everything from big business asset arranging (ERP) arrangements and plant correspondences to cargo forwarders and stock administration programming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The supply chain is the key competitive advantage for your business. Companies like Inditex, as well as Amazon, has set new industry standards for innovative logistics in 2016 and set a testament to the supply chain plays in a company’s success. Logistics are following the trend “innovate or die”, its main focus is on earnings, growth and customer loyalty.

Finally, we predict a big rise in the use of web-based technology for it’s a no-brainer to help drive efficiency in 2016.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">2. Better tracking for shipments</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Online shopping has come a long way from its inception, but shipment tracking is one area companies need to improve for a better experience. Important areas like warehouse technology, customer friendly communication through email and tech etc. are some of the key factors to give your shoppers proper information. The information includes where their order is and when it will be with them. As a result best companies are already doing these processes and achieving increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. We expect online sellers will join soon in offering better tracking options in 2016.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">3. Supply Chain Tracking Will Be Significant</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Companies provide updates of the inventories and tracking of shipment movements in the supply chain that helps to ensure a throughout customer satisfaction. They know they have stock they need always. As a result, technology is becoming increasingly important in 2017, especially for B2B E-Commerce companies.</p>

It’s a mark of great customer service, and logistics technology makes it easier to handle in 2017. Return Merchandise Authorisation or RMA will make it easier to track a return and jibe more data visible to the customer.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">5. Smart Reporting For Improved Inventory Control</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, in 2017 we predict a rise in smart reporting. It’s vital to keep an eye on your stock level and it is not easy to read and analyze each data and it can be time-consuming. Logistics Technology will leverage instinctive, graphic data with a computerized alert to inform about the stock is low and near to expiry date.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">6. The World Will Be Reduced</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anything is possible in today’s global world. It important to deliver the product on time in the world of logistics. Customers are ordering from overseas and they are no longer keen to wait for weeks for their goods or services. Furthermore, in 2017, it will become more significant to deliver a quick turnaround to other countries.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">7. Grocery Orders Will Be More Common</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Customers will look online to shop for basic groceries and home related stuff from the services like Amazon Pantry. They don’t need to buy in a bulk to fulfill the demand.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">8. Planning ahead will be Crucial</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t get caught unrehearsed in 2016! Your hardest periods can be predictable. You should stay ahead of the game and get your stock fulfilled to ensure you can meet request throughout the year.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">9. The Cloud Will Be A Commonplace</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, side-lining traditional fulfillment technologies will no longer compete with the cloud-based fulfillment services which maintain the industry standard.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">10. The Customer Will Still Be The King</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017, the most successful companies will be those who will provide a seamless connection between the click of a customer’s mouse and the parcel through their letterbox.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, these statistics demonstrate that producers and retailers need to see strategic organizations embracing developing advances. The 3PL organizations themselves are making a mindful stride toward that path. Likewise, a considerable lot of them will find out about those advancements and give administrations. What is your contemplation on these four rising innovations and how they will shape the fate of coordination? Let’s hope for the best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">At the onset of every year, resolutions fill our bucket list in one of the ‘Must-to-do’ things. With so many resolutions, we promise to make every year, very few of them rarely gets fulfilled; so why not make a resolution this year which we can fulfill and feel proud of? A resolution to follow the latest e-commerce trends, to compete with the who’s who of the ever-booming industry. Well, when it comes to technology, the trends keep changing with the blink of an eye and if you miss one of them, you will lag behind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After doing an extensive research, the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">UIPL team</a> has come up with a set of trends that will dominate the e-commerce industry in 2016. So, let’s see what’s in store in the e-commerce industry this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. M-Commerce – A Necessity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">M-Commerce will no longer be the additional feature in your phone, but a need without which you cannot fulfill your shopping desires. A <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/mobile-is-changing-business/" target="_blank">research</a> done by Kissmetrics reveals that about 78% of searches done through a mobile phone resulted in a purchase. Moreover, it also revealed that 2 out of 3 customers like to shop online through a mobile website rather than a mobile application. These figures show that there is a rise in the use of mobile phones when it comes to online shopping. Any company which offers <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>e-commerce website development services in India</strong></a> needs to make sure that they optimize the website and offer smooth touch screen options as well as high-resolution web page viewing experience. So, that customers enjoy a memorable shopping experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Shopping Is Fun With A Tablet</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A report published by ICSC (International Council of Shopping Centers) suggests that omni channel customers, that is the one’s who purchase through mobile phones, desktop or any other device, spend 3.5 times greater in online shopping than single-channel shoppers. Now, the ever-increasing screen sizes of mobile phones are diverting customers from their desktop. In fact, it can be said that use of Tablets is on the rise due to their large screen sizes. People these days, either take the help of a Tablet or a mobile phone in order to do a preliminary research of the product and then make the purchasing decision. The convenience that a Tablet provides in terms of better resolution makes Tablets the next best thing for e-commerce.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Automated Marketing &#8211; The New Language For Email Marketing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Phrases like ‘50% discount only for you’ or ‘Grab your last chance of Christmas sale’ will bring a new revolution in e-mail marketing. With the emergence of more and more online shopping websites, customers are looking for personalized services that will pay more attention to their shopping needs. It is expected that in 2016 features like automatic display of products preferred by customers or automated recommendations, more personalized web pages and special discount offers will shape up the e-commerce space. Hence, Automated Marketing is thus an easy way to keep your customers remain loyal to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. More Details About Product</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the perils of an online shopping website is the inability to physically verify the product. Well, this peril can be transformed easily into a blessing by giving more and more details about the details. Writing product specifications, posting demo videos of the products and high-resolution images are the keys to bringing the customer closer to the product. By adopting such measures, you let the customers know about your products and establish a relationship with them. Personalization will also play a vital role. For instance: if you share the solution of a technical problem related to the product, then their faith on you and on the brand is bound to increase, thus enhancing their trust over you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. The Great Rise of ‘Deal-of-the-day ’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also known as Flash sales, Deal-of-the-day is finally going to see the light as it is slowly becoming popular with the customers on festivals and any other special occasions like New Year, Independence Day or a Thanksgiving Day. These kinds of sales lasts might last up to few hours or even continue for days. If your e-commerce website is mobile optimized, then it will be easier for websites to boost up their sales faster. Though it cannot be said how effective will be the concept of ‘Deal-of-the-day,’ but once it is received well by the customer, it will certainly stay for a long time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. Tracking Customer’s Data Through Algorithms</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use of Algorithms to track all vital information about customers helps an online retailer to get the exact information about the details of the customer. It gives the retailer an idea about the buying preference of the visitor and turn him into a real customer. This trend of analyzing the behavior of the customer will be one of the major trends in <a href="https://unifiedinfotech.wordpress.com/2015/12/09/whats-in-store-for-e-commerce-in-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">e-commerce for 2016</a>. It will prove to be a blessing for small businesses as they will get an accurate data about their customers with the help of statistical data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. Improved Shipping For Better Shopping Experience</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Receiving a product within few days of ordering it is a much better experience than a 5-day delay in the product delivery. In 2016, improved shipping with on time delivery will be one of the emerging trends. People are going to shift more towards an e-commerce brand that not only promises of fast delivery but actually makes it available at the doorstep of the customer within few days of ordering it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the <a href="https://unified-infotech.blogspot.com/2015/12/e-commerce-website-development-best.html" target="_blank">eCommerce</a> revolution is gaining pace all over the world with the emergence of more and more online ventures, it is important to ensure that a customer gets the maximum return on his or her investment and the time spent in purchasing a product online.

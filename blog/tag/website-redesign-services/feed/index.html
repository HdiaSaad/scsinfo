										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">With the festive season approaching near, the excitement level has reached its crescendo. People are now waiting for the D-day of celebration as a number of occasions comes ahead in the next few weeks, starting with the Thanksgiving Day, followed subsequently with bigger celebrations like Cyber Monday, Black Friday, Christmas and New Year. With most of the retailers going online with their business, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>website redesign</strong></a> is a game-changing factor for them, who want to revamp the structure and design of his or her website, this holiday season.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Holiday Season And Buying Behaviour</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The PwC 2016 Holiday Outlook report, estimates that holiday spending in the US is going to increase by 10% in 2016 as compared to the previous year. Moreover, the positive aspect is that there will be a 25% increase in digital sales, which is a great news for online retailers. Shoppers will spend an average amount of $1,121 on per head basis. Hence, these strong statistics strongly suggest that there will be a blast in the selling carts and retailers will reap away the maximum profits from this year’s holiday season sale. Faster checkout options, affordable prices, and well-stocked stores are the three characteristics which are going to rule the shopping industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As global borders continue to blur in online shopping, there has been a wide acceptance of mobile commerce all over the world. The increasing usage of mobile phone hence acts as a contributing factor to the massive holiday sales this year. Brands are available today within a tap on the mobile screen and consumers are eager to get an instant delivery of their desired product. Independent retailers and local businessmen have a great opportunity to tap potential customers from the market. With mobile phone usage at a rapid rate, it will be become easier for marketers to understand the consumer&#8217;s behavior. At the same time, they can also imply the right marketing strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Website Redesign is an important area that always remains on top of the website checklist especially during holiday season. This part of the year is perhaps the best ever time when one can utilize all the resources and implement them to earn the maximum revenue. A clever website redesign combined with the right marketing strategy will lay out the perfect revenue-earning path. After reading this blog, you will be more confident and take the right decision when it comes to redesigning your website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>So, Is Your Website Ready For The Holiday Season?</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make your website ready for the upcoming holiday season, it is necessary to go for a redesign. However, you must ask yourselves to ask some questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Are The CTAs And Buy Buttons Effective?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want visitors who keep on hopping from one website to the other get stuck to your website, then the only way to do it is by designing effective call-to-action buttons that converts the visitors in to full time customers. For instance: just below the purchasing item, you can keep a number of options like warranty options apart from the ‘Add to cart’ option. An ‘add to wish list’ item is yet another interesting way to keep customers stay at your website for a longer time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Can Your Website Handle Multiple Visitors? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you go for a website redesign or any other development feature, always ask yourself, can your website handle multiple visitors? Holiday season is the peak time when you will witness a flood of visitors. Well, if you think that your website is not capable enough, fret not. Either go for shared hosting or a dedicated hosting. While you might have heard about these two kinds of hosting, however, Colocated hosting is yet another kind of hosting which can ease your task. Here, the company purchases server in its own name and has the host facility with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do You Want To Go For Redesign?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have been experiencing a slump in the number of visitors in your website, then it is the time that you go for a website redesign immediately. This is perhaps the best time to rebrand your business. Make changes in the navigation structure of the website and its URLs to help the customers get a new look for your website rather than experiencing the same bored look. You can also implement a 301 redirect plan. In addition to this, one can also change the fonts. Add a festive touch to the fonts to have a maximum impact on the visitors.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Jazz Up Your Website With These Amazing Holiday Tips</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use a pop up on the home page of your website with a nice animation. This could also be a gif.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Write a holiday special blog post.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Send holiday special coupons to customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spread the word in social media regarding any new deals or offers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep in touch with last year’s buyers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Showcase the holiday special products in your home page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Highlight the sign up portion of email.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Introduce customers to new brands.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap Up!</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no better time, other than the holiday season to improve your bottom line. Website redesign acts as a catalyst to keep the profits consistent through the year. Keep in mind that your website is bound to get busier during the holiday season, hence it should be redesigned in such a way that it attracts the maximum traffic to the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Customers always look for something unique and interesting. You cannot let them down especially during the holiday season. Understanding the customer psyche and turning them into real time customers is the key to making your e-commerce website ready.</p>

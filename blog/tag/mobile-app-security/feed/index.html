										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate of mobile adoption is rising day by day, and along with that, the number of apps on app stores is increasing. Currently, </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266210/number-of-available-applications-in-the-google-play-store/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google play store boasts of having 2.6 million apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple app store has 2.1 million apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But are all these apps safe to use?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://learn.g2.com/cybercrime-statistics" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of mobile malware targeting various mobile devices increased by 54% in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with that, the </span><a href="https://en.yeeply.com/blog/6-security-risks-android-mobile-application-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that 95% of Android devices are affected by malware.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that being said, how secure is your mobile app?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smartphone is an inseparable part of our life today. We are using it for everything, from booking tickets to paying bills, keeping up with our health stats and many other things. All this we are doing with the help of various mobile apps available on the app stores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If these apps stop being secure, then it might create issues like IP theft or fraud, data theft, unauthorized access. Along with that, as an app owner, you’ll face issues such as angry user reviews and loss of revenue and reputation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start on securing your app, take a quick look at why your app needs to fulfill the proper security standards.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is It Important To Have A Mobile App Security Standards?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until a few years ago, you only had to worry about being a victim of cybercrime on your computer. Smartphone users rarely did any kind of banking or online transaction with their smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with the improvement of smartphones and reduced data charges, smartphones are being used for everything today. And that leaves the users open to a large number of threats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile applications today come with a certain degree of inherent security. For example, if Facebook’s app server goes down, the app saved on your phone won’t work. But installing a fake or malicious app from a third party app store, or opening a malicious link or attachment in an email or social media messages can compromise the security of your device.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8932" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8932" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8932" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mobile-app-security-checklist-stats.png" alt="mobile app security checklist stats" width="610" height="395" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mobile-app-security-checklist-stats.png 610w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mobile-app-security-checklist-stats-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8932" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://blog.singsys.com/mobile-apps-security-ios-android/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though mobile malware threat is not yet as serious as computer malware, the numbers of threats are still rising every day. According to </span><a href="https://securelist.com/mobile-malware-evolution-2018/89689/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies done by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaspersky Lab mobile security solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the number of attacks on mobiles through malicious software is around </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">116.5 million, double the amount of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 which was 66.4 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this kind of rising threat, if you are thinking about developing an app for your business, then you need to follow a certain checklist to make your app safe for your users. But what should be on that checklist?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is the checklist followed by our organization when it comes to the security system of mobile applications developed by us. This checklist is the result of extensive research into threats faced by mobile apps and </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this kind of rising threat, if you are thinking of developing an app for your business, then you need to follow a certain checklist to make your app safe for your users. </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what should be on that checklist?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is the checklist followed by our organization when it comes to the security system of mobile apps developed by us. This checklist is the result of extensive research into threats faced by mobile apps and the security measures needed to save them and our users from malicious software and threats such as ID theft, phishing, loss of online banking details, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following checklist can be of real help to you if you are looking for a comprehensive list of the things your app needs to make it safe. So let&#8217;s take a look at this mobile app security checklist.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is Your Mobile App Secure? Check This List To Know</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mobile app is basically a few simple things rolled into one- there is a product code, the business rationale towards the back end system, and the customer side, databases, APIs funneling data between the two, the device its operating framework and the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are a big organization or a small startup, having a mobile application with strong security in an aggressive market can make a big difference for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a mobile app security checklist for you to follow, to give your users complete safety when they use the application.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Writing The Right Code: Build It From The Ground Up</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your app’s source code can have vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can come from developer error, not testing the code properly, or maybe the hackers are simply targeting your app specifically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native apps are different from web applications. Web Applications are basically data that is data and software that exists on the server. Native apps are on the other hand have their own codes that reside on the user&#8217;s handset once installed. This makes it easy for hackers to attack the mobile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how can you make your app secure?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encrypt your code. A well written and secure code is well encrypted and hard to read, so make sure to use a modern, well-supported algorithm with API encryption.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test source codes for vulnerabilities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While adding security measures, keep in mind that it should not compromise the performance and device battery, file size and runtime memory.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because your app has the approval of the app store does not make it 100% safe. </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2018/11/26/google-play-malware-apps/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, Google removed 13 apps from app store for containing malware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after they had already been downloaded 500,000 times. App store’s security checking is not infallible, so check your app for security issues yourself.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Enhance security features on a platform-by-platform Basis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps are available on different devices today. So does one security measure mean that it will be secure for all platforms?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the device and platform being used, apps need different kinds of security measures. </span><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/security/265809-ios-is-generally-more-secure-than-android.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is said that iOS is more secure than the Android platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Android being an open source operating system, is more open to threats and problems related to mobile app security. This is why you need to implement different security measures for different platforms and devices.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Allow user permissions</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By giving the users option to choose their own security settings based on their personal preferences, you can provide them with ultimate security standards in your application. This way the app will ask the users permission for accessing different data on the phone, and the user will have the choice to let the app access the data on their phone or deny the request.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8933" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8933" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marshmallow-permissions-6.jpg" alt="mobile app security checklist " width="1600" height="1200" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marshmallow-permissions-6.jpg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marshmallow-permissions-6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marshmallow-permissions-6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marshmallow-permissions-6-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8933" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.androidcentral.com/look-application-permissions</figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Be Careful Of Using Third-Party Libraries</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is probably one of the most neglected points when it comes to security of mobile apps. Many mobile application developers use third party libraries to write codes in order to develop their app quickly. Such libraries offer codes which you can use to build their apps. But are these codes secure?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time these third-party library codes are tampered with by the hackers. Using these codes for your app without testing them first means decreasing the security of your own app. So make sure to test the third party library codes before implementing them in your own app. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Tamper Proof Techniques: Necessary For Safety</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a general practice of the hackers to embed malicious codes into mobile applications, which will let them access any data in your app and then use it for their benefit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement a tamper-proof technique such as checksums, digital signatures and other techniques to detect violation to your app codes.  in your application means getting an alert anytime someone makes any changes to your application code. Having a log of code changes that are done by authorized sources means bad tampering with your app code can be detected easily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to implement different trigger against code changes on different levels of the app. This will give you a caution when any altercations happen to your codes. For example, confirmation of the signature of the application at run time, performing the environment checks, identifying the app installer, etc.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Securing The Data During Transit And Storage</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main challenge any mobile application faces when it comes to security is the interaction they need to do with outer system, through Wi-Fi, cellular system, VPN, non-encoded systems, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you transfer data from the device to the cloud, it is vulnerable to external attacks and theft. Which is why encode the basic client data such as login information, passwords and any individual information collected by the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting away the information in scrambled information compartments makes it harder for the hackers to access or use them. Additionally, any information that is pointless should never be stored away within the phone memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securing the data during transit and storage is a crucial part of the security checklist for your app.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Repeated Testing: Once Is Not Enough</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeated application testing is one of the ways you can make sure that your mobile app is secure to use. On each phase of development, you need to thoroughly test the app to eliminate any security problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While testing the mobile app, test it from both the client and the server side. This way you can figure out the vulnerabilities on both ends, and how much load the app can actually take. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updating your app on regular intervals makes it easier to figure out the holes in your codes and patch them up. But check the updated versions as well before you release it on the app store.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Cryptography Tools And Techniques: Use The Latest Kinds</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unavoidable part of any mobile app security checklist, the cryptography tool and techniques have more effect over the security measures of your app than you think. To make your app most secure, use the latest cryptography tools and techniques. The use of backdated protocols such as MD5 and SHA1 are not enough to provide ample mobile security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers need to use cutting edge encryption APIs, for example, 256-piece AES encryption joined with SHA-256 for hashing. App developers can put resources into danger displaying, penetration testing, etc.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. A Trusted Backend</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most hackers attack with the intent of stealing information, and almost </span><a href="https://teskalabs.com/blog/backend-security-importance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">72% of this attack happens on backend portion of any app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is crucial for you to protect the backend of your app as it is the storage for all your data which you need to collect to run the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, people store all the information remotely or on cloud server. This exposes the backend to certain vulnerabilities and puts the information of your users and employees at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like the frontend system, you can eliminate the issues and vulnerabilities of the backend system through security testing and data encryption before deployment.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Use Of Data Encryption</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data encryption is an effective way for you to secure sensitive user data before storing it on the backend. It translates data into another form or code, that can only be read by authorized parties.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8934" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8934" style="width: 439px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-8934 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/5.png" alt="Images" width="439" height="311" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/5.png 439w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/5-300x213.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8934" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.nativescript.org/blog/secure-your-mobile-app-securing-data-in-transit</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easy to encrypt Data or plaintext using encryption algorithm and encryption key. You can access/read the encrypted data, or ciphertext if you decrypt the data with the proper key.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to encrypt whatever data you collect through your app. And only authorized parties have access to the encryption key. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">11. The Use Of Authorized API</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always use authorized APIs in your app. The absence of authorized APIs can give hackers access to use your information. Make sure you check the username and password, or if the token is signed and not expired is involved in a proper authentication process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the authorization process, the resources are check to see what your user can access and modify and what they can not access at all. Both authentication and authorization process are interdependent. And you can use them together to give only the right users access to your API. So make sure that Authorized API is an important part of your mobile app security checklist.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8935" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8935" style="width: 996px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8935" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ovvAZ.png" alt="mobile app security checklist authorization" width="996" height="556" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ovvAZ.png 996w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ovvAZ-300x167.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ovvAZ-768x429.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8935" class="wp-caption-text">Source:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45560910/how-to-authenticate-authorize-a-client-side-web-app-using-remote-nodejs-api-th</figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">12. High-Level Authentication</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile apps face weak authentication protocol as one of the top vulnerabilities. As an app owner or developer, you need to give authentication utmost priorities when it comes to security of your mobile app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a strong password policy so that it cannot be broken easily enough. Passwords are one of the most important and common modes of authentication so make sure that it can’t be broken easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use multi-factor authentication process. It can be through OTP via text message or through authentication code sent over email. You can make the multi-factor authentication process even more secure by the biometric process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">13. Least Privileges With Codes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To secure the source code for your app, give only a limited number of people the privilege to access or modify it. By keeping this network as small as possible you will be limiting the chances of code- tampering and insertion of malicious codes into your source codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may seem like a trivial point in this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> checklist, but the fewer people know the codes, the better it is for your app’s security. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">14. Continuous Updating And Patching The Holes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not enough to just build a secure mobile app, but you have to keep updating it to keep it secure for your users to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not updating your app makes it vulnerable to newer threats and types of attacks by the hackers. Continuously updating the app and patching the holes in its code is the best way to keep your app secure. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile app security threats: Android vs. iOS</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s take a look at one of the most important differences between Android and iOS devices-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android os depends on an open source code, which means anyone, even the user of an Android device can tinker with the operating system. On the other hand, iOS is a closed system, and no one can modify the source codes of an iOS device. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too much tampering with Android system codes and you can create a system vulnerability that can be exploited by the hackers. iOS on the other hand for being a closed system is not easy to target for the hackers. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does it mean developing security measures for iOS apps is easier than Android apps?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform you’re creating for doesn’t diminish the workload as far as security testing and developing applications safely is concerned. There is more ‘dirt’ on Android than iOS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Apple has a stricter control over which apps get published and distributed through their official app store, there are still some incidents which showed that Apple’s app verification technique may not be completely foolproof. </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iOS app developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to have the same attention to security detail while developing an app as an Android app developer should have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google, on the other hand, has an open-minded approach to app publishing on its app store. As a result of which many apps containing malware gets published and uploaded on the phone before the user even knows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why instead of blindly trusting the credibility of the app stores and their security check, secure your mobile app from the very beginning, implementing it on every level of your app so that hackers can not use your app for their malicious intents. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How You Can Fail To Secure Your Mobile App Properly</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top reason why app developers fail to secure their app is the lack of QA and testing. In their hurry of developing and releasing the app, they skip over this process or go through it in a half-hearted manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is the most important step towards making your app more secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you’ve developed your app, you need to run it through proper testing. Automated and manual testings are the two kinds of tests that any app should go through before you launch them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your app is a combination of different components that are run together with the help of codes. By running your app through proper tests, you can figure out if there are any problems with the codes. One single flaw in your coding can leave your app open to be exploited by a hacker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proper testing of your app is not only going to give your mobile app a proper security measure, but it will also give you a look into its functionality. It is an important way to ensure that your app can be downloaded, installed and used without any issues.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Word On Mobile App Security</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the constant rise in popularity of mobile phones, users are continuously becoming more app-dependent. And hackers out there are exploiting this dependency to steal personal information, banking information to use it for their own benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this scenario, having a strong security strategy for your mobile app is not only going to give your user a sense of security but also boost the reputation of your own organization. In addition to that, it will save you the immense cost of fixing a mobile security breach. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any Mobile App Development Company you hire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should apply this mobile security system industriously to ensure your mobile developers can thoroughly consider unintended outcomes of compromised app security. Conveying a simple to-utilize application will diminish the brand esteem in the event that you put client or enterprise data at risk.</span></p>

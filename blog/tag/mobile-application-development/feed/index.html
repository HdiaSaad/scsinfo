										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The world is gradually shifting from laptop and desktop to tablets and smartphones. This impending shift in technology leads to potential money-making opportunities for budding entrepreneurs. Investing in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile application development</strong></a> helps in extending your reach to your customers and improving sales. However, if you are looking to develop a successful mobile app, intensive research is necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile applications fall under two broad categories, B2B and B2C. The accomplishment of a mobile app depends on the concept you develop it on. It includes identifying the target users, how you can keep your users hooked and finally how efficient your app performs.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What Are B2B Mobile Apps?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B2B mobile apps are only applications that target different businesses. They&#8217;re gradually picking up the merited significance in the application store. The significance of mobility is a current marvel and, as per an investigation by Salesforce, 70% marketers are taking a gander at mobility services to streamline their business needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, email was the most intense apparatus for officials who are always on the go. With the development of innovative mobile apps, more detailed assignments, (for example, making records, introductions, and so forth.) have turned out to be less demanding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finding the correct apparatuses to target businesses is the stimulating task, however, once the idea is clear, at that point you can achieve the success to the street of B2B application.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why B2B Mobile Apps?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The advantage of a B2B application is the versatility and structure. The application procedure is very straight forward, which means businesses create the applications to understand a specific undertaking or need.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How about we take a documentation application for instance. It&#8217;s worked for business improvement executives, sales personnel and basically all field specialists to use to speak with their customers. The motivation behind the application is plainly characterized – Make a documentation app with preset formats to make well-crafted emails, deals proposition, introductions, set updates, and so forth. The functionalities unmistakably characterized in such a case, prompting simple correspondence with the engineer. Additionally, drawing in an intended interest group is simple as this specific application is much of the time utilized by 99% of executives in the sales and marketing field.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All experts have their own particular savvy gadgets and this radically chops down the speculation fetched for business to contribute on mobile apps. There are likewise different new elements that are coming into the market. There are like Geo-location tagging, local push warning, reference point, beacon, and so forth. You can take business applications to an individual level and enable deals to individuals target end clients effectively.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pitfalls of B2B Mobile Apps</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B2B applications are very costly to make when compared with B2C. The principle reason is that when we consider an efficient application or a documentation application, you need to consider a lot of elements to make it valuable for the end-users. What&#8217;s more, these components cost cash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another pitfall: They&#8217;re difficult to offer. Business officials take a gander at mobile applications as a resource for diminishing their work time. At the point when the application is moderate and not easy to use, it won’t offer. The components and functionalities should work flawlessly remembering end-users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Likewise, showcasing a B2B application requires a remarkable approach, as organizations need to do a lot of research before making a business-related purchase.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What are <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/what-is-b2c-e-commerce-the-online-retail-secrets-revealed-here/" target="_blank">B2C Mobile Apps</a>?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A B2C app is nothing but a mobile app that the consumers use on daily basis. B2C mobiles apps are the most famous types of apps that flooded with apps that hoping to become the next Angry Bird, Temple Run or Instagram.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though there are over millions of B2C apps the success rate of almost half of the apps is dubious. B2C apps consist of social media apps, gaming apps, photo sharing apps, etc. the competition in the B2C space is a seriously real thing.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why B2C Mobile Apps?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B2C mobile applications have a more extensive group of audience range. The application ideas can be as basic as a Su-Do-Ku generator and users would at present love it. In this way, you don&#8217;t need to re-examine the wheel or add a few functionalities to amuse your group of audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, another awesome preferred standpoint is that B2C applications can undoubtedly &#8220;go viral&#8221; in a way that B2B applications don&#8217;t. Perfect case: Flappy Bird.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pitfalls Of B2C Apps</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you consider an inventive thought to make an application, the chances are that somebody effectively created it and it&#8217;s in the Play Store. The flood of applications in the B2C part may impede the development of new applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smartphone users tend to have a tendency to download applications that have great evaluations and have many variant updates to guarantee that the application has beat the experimentation stage. Chances are that another application will go absolutely unnoticed, unless and until it&#8217;s super innovative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, finding the correct value point can be troublesome. The application ought to dependably be evaluated inside the desirable price range of $0.99 or $1.99 to lure clients to download it. At the point when the cost display builds, more clients tend to look down on it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Correspondingly, the purchasers are the users of the application. If they are not happy with the application&#8217;s execution, well, pay special attention to a ton of bad reviews.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">B2B Vs B2C – Which Should You Choose?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A B2C application may cost somewhat less, however, you can expect a mass marketing campaign to get any market entrance. Also, that will cost you a considerable measure of cash. Different social media campaigns, mailer crusades, third party app campaigns, and so on ought to actualize to get the brand perceivability required for the achievement of the B2C portable application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Likewise, you can charge more for B2B applications. B2C application estimating ought to likewise settle to a base when contrasted with B2B applications. Buyers will dependably abstain from purchasing applications with over the top estimating though organizations have a financial plan for putting resources into mobile applications. Additionally, iOS have alternatives to implement mass B2B application license purchases. Making utilization of such usefulness prompts a higher income era with a solitary deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">B2B applications additionally have a loyal customer retention rate when contrasted with the B2C application client. The most recent mobile app proves the conspicuous increment in the interest for B2B applications in the market. The interest for B2C is taking a gander at an approaching downfall with the flooding applications neglecting to inspire clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Automation testing takes up mobile application testing one notch higher. Unit tests target at removing the blocks in app design. But automatic testing ensures proper integration. It is a proper way to conduct app testing without any fallacy. A mobile application development company makes automation testing a fundamental step. It helps them to run through the key stages of mobile application. There is no doubt that it saves a lot of time and is the most cost-effective process for a company.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Necessity Of Automated Testing In the App World</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the development stage, manual tests help a lot. They enable a developer to change the source code in various environments. It is useful for changing hardware configurations. Automated Testing offers more advance functionality. It is possible to playback all the pre recorded actions and pre define them. These tests can repeat to extend the tasks already performed. You don’t even need to test it to execute the task. Hence, automated testing is the best alternative. A <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile application development company</strong></a> implements it to get the best results. Many engineers around the whole world depend on this essential component. It makes the impossible task possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many software engineers around the world have taken the help of manual testing. It makes the task possible for them to develop an application. You might be wondering that how automation facilitates the testing process?  First of all, it improves the accuracy of testing. It is a well-known fact that even the most meticulous tester will have a fault. They perform the same steps like the original testing process. Testers can get rid from repetitive tests and have time to make new automated software tests. As a result, one can solve complicated problems. It helps to solve it in the best possible manner. A mobile application development company creates automated software tests for solving complex features.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Where manual testing stops, automatic testing begins. It can activate thousands of virtual users while interacting within a network. These tests helps developers to point out their problems even it goes to the QA team. The source code changes only when the team notifies the developer. If one executes the same task with <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/a-comparison-of-the-best-test-automation-tools/" target="_blank">automated software testing</a>, then it becomes easier. It boosts the morale of developers as well as testers. Choosing automation testing also increases the possibility of covering robust testing. Today, one can execute various cases every time one goes for a test run. Doing a test run is impossible without automation.</p>
<h3>Great Automation Testing Techniques For Perfect App Development</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Automation Testing plays a pivotal role when it comes to developing a robust mobile app. To make it easier for the testers, we are sharing with you these amazing testing tips.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Inject the Dependencies</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One must ensure that the app dependencies take place in the best possible manner. Most of the apps depend on high-level interaction. This is only possible if you are testing for a limited time. As a tester, you must test the application instead of the server. All you have to do is test the code. If you work with iOS, then use XCUI tests. One can create automated tests applying the core logic of an app. Mobile application development company uses these dependencies to create robust apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Native Tools</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a developer, you must test your code. The primary purpose of the code is to ease the process of development. One must run the code with a single click. Expert developers must run all the IDE. Choosing tools play an important role here. Automated Testing divides into two categories – native automation and cross platform wrapper. They are faster than the ones used in wrapper framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improved Frameworks</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two frameworks that iOS and Android use – Calabash and Appium. For a mobile application development company, these are the benchmarks. Several platforms are custom made for web application. One can use the UI between various platforms as well. Use continuous integration server to catch the best tools. As a developer, one must write interactive codes to get the positive results. To set up a comprehensive suite of activities you need to work with the best tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Take A Strong Decision</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to set up an exclusive automation suite, there are many options. Every testing tool has its own pros and cons. Automation testing brings a great platform to the developers. It gives them a wide landscape where one can choose from a variety of options. Activate the IDE and many layers will form. So, it is important to take an informed decision.  Using wrapper frameworks add abstraction layers for easy communication.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Wrap Up!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To deliver a seamless testing experience, automation is the only way out. It depicts and finds out most number of errors. Thus, a tester facilitates the process in a much faster manner. As a mobile application development company, we strive to provide the best.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Prototype is the answer to find an alternate solution to a problem. One uses the same infrastructure and creates a different product. It is a system development method, which helps to develop a more upgraded product. Prototyping works in the best development scenario. The work continues unless the product derives completely from the original one. A <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile application development company</strong></a> depends upon prototyping based on various factors. Designing stage and project timings are the two of them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Do You Need A Mobile Prototype?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, this is the first question whose answer you must have. Sometimes it helps to test the wire framing of an app. There are some basic criterions on which prototyping depends. Availability of collaboration, creating wireframes and usability testing. The ability to create responsive designs and cloud based access also matters a lot. Mock ups play an important role here. If you already have a mock up already available with you, then use third party softwares to create one. Always keep in mind about the type of operating system for which you are using. If you are using free tools, then implement them based on the designing stage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A mobile application development company sometimes goes for the Do It Yourself (DIY) route. In case you are starting from the scratch, there are varieties of tools available. However, it all depends on your experience level. As a developer, one must be flexible to write codes in Java and any other languages. Combining visual components and animations help to create a flexible coding environment. From conception to the final stage execution, it forms an inherent part. Prototyping helps to create a consistent workflow in the app development process. In other words, Prototype is a simpler alternative. It helps to evolve an application in advance form using practical approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last and the most important factor is evaluating your financial requirements. Project management involves plenty of planning and strategies. Before making a prototype, be sure that it is financially viable. Prototyping involves a lot of cost especially for a mobile application development company. It depends on the type of features, which are available, and the kind of access you have with them. It is also important to determine the stage of your project. Once you are confident, you can start implementing the project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3 Options You Must Explore As A Developer While Prototyping</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Go For The DIY Route</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one economical way of prototyping. It depends on the kind of experience you have. A variety of tools is available to help you start the task. Framer JS is a great option to start writing the code. However, it is necessary to know JavaScript. The language gives confidence to a developer when it comes to prototyping. Currently, efforts are in progress to include animations and visual components.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Utilize The Maximum Time</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a mobile application development company, learn to utilize your time in the best way. Prototyping is an easy way to save both time and money. Unlike final designs, you don’t need any perfect UX here. All you have to do is sketch your idea, develop the wireframe and put it in the digital tool of your choice. Don’t forget to put your prototype in front of your users and ask for their feedback. With the right feedback, you can make proper changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Make Your Own Team</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Select the best members of your team before you start prototyping. It might be a bit problematic for you in the beginning. However, it will surely fetch good results. The benefit of working in a team is that you will get to know about various perspectives. Another benefit is the team gets a perfect control over the full development process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the team is aware about the development process, it can habituate with the project. Prototyping brings various tools which makes it easier for the developers to work with.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Technical Factors To Keep In Mind</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The viability of a prototype project also depends upon the technicality. While making prototype models, keep in mind about some important factors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interactive Fidelity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are various depths to an interaction level. When you are prototyping, find out what is the degree of interaction you want. The interaction can be either static or critical. In a static page, the clickable areas are minimum. On the other hand, with hyperlinks there will be multi step interactions. There are various mock up prototypes which supports less interactions. A developer can use third party mockups for more deep-rooted interactions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Support With Gestures </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It primarily involves designing the inputs. It all depends upon the project requirements. All the major UX tools support it. Many times, built in features like multi-finger inputs and gesture formulations are useful. They stand as a support to swipe. If your prototype tool has the dampening effect to it, then it is necessary to leverage the tool with many APIs. You can go for Framer or Pixate, they support multi finger gestures as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interactive Animation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First understand whether you need animation or not in the prototype. Many robust tools are available online for perfect execution. There are some tools, which come with built in animations. Xcode and BluePrint are few of them to mention. Sometimes, you might require properties like friction and velocity. In that case, you can choose Framer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a mobile application development company, prototyping is a daunting task. However, keep the technical factors in mind to deliver the best projects. In addition to this, a developer must go with the DIY route and utilize the maximum time. Prototyping makes complicated mobile applications simpler. You can execute projects without wasting much time.</p>

As an entrepreneur, you must adapt a user-friendly approach to developing such an application. It should not only be Christmas themed, rather it should be interactive at the same time</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Celebrating The Christmas Spirit With A Mobile App</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is time to get into the Christmas mood. Sing a carol, decorate everywhere with ballons and play with the Santa. These are some of the most common activities which one usually days on a Christmas eve. But why do all this when you have an application that prevents you from all the hassles? A mobile app can be the ultimate solution in today’s digital world. One tap and you can witness everything right on your mobile screen. The digital eruption in the 21st century has made life more digital. There is never a single moment when users look away from their mobile phones.

It doesn’t matter whether they have a website or not. Money-saving offers the ease of purchase through app influences a shopper to use the app. The ability to locate stores of mobile apps is another factor. Tablet shoppers mostly depend on their friends’ feedback before installing it. E-mailers and newsletters, on the other hand, is a driving factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Browsing a website is a hectic task. A mobile app gives an instant solution and provides the user with plenty of options. Retailers can’t miss this wonderful chance to tap on the untapped customers. They need to draw clear distinctions between the mobile apps and mobile websites. While a mobile website just gives access to a customer online. On the other hand, a mobile app gives a far richer customer experience. Push notifications engage more. They keep a shopper fully updated about the latest festive deals and offers. Reward programs and mobile payments facilitate the app development on a single platform.</p>

So, planning well in advance is the key here. Developers must be well accustomed to the planning process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Get On With The Holiday Spirit</strong>: Using Santa Claus hats in the visuals is a very cliché thing. Go for something different this time. Carry the Christmas vibe throughout the app. It’s not only about the visuals. Rather, it is the style of communication, which is important to convey to the target customer. Keep a customized Christmas message with a suitable call-to-action word. Once you are ready with the app, prepare to optimize it after the upload.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Forbes found out that it was the inability of the companies to take a firm decision in mobile app development and the costs incurred in hiring a developer, that were responsible for the escalation in the cost of developing a mobile application. While one might think that the availability of numerous plug-ins and cloud-based applications today can help to reduce the burden in making a mobile app, but in reality, these are not the exact reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Companies today spend endless hours before taking a final decision in developing an app. The true story is that there are a number of factors to be considered if you are planning to build the dream app of your choice. As a </span><a title="Mobile Application Development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>mobile app development </b></span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">company, we take into account various considerations before we start working on the project. Doing these help us to select the right mobile application tools for the dream app. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Lay Focus On The Usability Of The App</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The interface of the mobile application should be easy to work with from the developer’s perspective. Most of the time, collaboration becomes an issue. In that case, whatever tool is selected, it should be able to enhance it. While evaluating a project, the functionality of the tool should be the top of the mind consideration for the developers. Before taking up a project, they should repeatedly test the pros and cons and then give their final decision. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Keep The Cost Structure In Mind</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are a number of costs that are involved in making an app. For instance: the licensing cost of development tools, developing the applications and deploying them. While low-cost options like cloud-based services can be a suitable solution, but it is important to be aware of the long- term expenses as well. You might know that these services, which seem to be less expensive might add a burden to your budget in the long-term.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Evaluate The Lifecycle Of The App</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Before selecting the tools required for making an app, it is necessary to evaluate the lifecycle of the mobile app. If a team of developers is working towards developing an app, then they must be aware of the total lifecycle of the app. This principle is also applicable when the company depends on an external or a third party service provider. In a nutshell, the developers must be aware of an app’s shelf life.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Permissions Regarding Security </b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Make sure that all the app development tools, which you choose allow the admin to make use of the security controls in the app. It is important to have a supreme body and accountability irrespective of whatever tools are used by the developers. To make things easier, let us take an example. If a set of developers make use of cloud services, they must be regulated and must be aware of the consequences for the breach in security.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Be Aware Of The Integration </b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Developers must be aware of the total integration process of the services with the systems that are associated with the application. Apart from providing seamless integration with the systems, the application should also be able to integrate itself with all other systems necessary for integration. It might be necessary for developers to make applications that support mobile application management and here comes the role of integration.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Choose The Application Type </b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It is important for the developer to have deep knowledge about the merits and demerits of the various applications. Native applications usually are expensive. They offer the best user experience along with superior performance, takes the maximum time to build and can run across a variety of platforms. It all varies from one organization to the other about which application they want to choose.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>Overcoming the Challenges in Mobile Application Testing Tools</b></i></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sometimes it becomes a challenging task to select the right tool while testing mobile application tools. Here, we are presenting to you some easy ways through which you can follow if you want to test a mobile application tool thoroughly, and then just follow these easy tips. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Always do tool feasibility tests as mobile technologies functions differently on various platforms.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Apply automation in non-functional areas such as hardware and interruption.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">It is necessary to properly integrate the execution with the test management tool as well as ALM in order to make the mobile application successful.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">It is better to optimize on a platform. In rare cases, more than one tool might be required to carry on the automation process. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Select the tools in such a way that they support stimulators as well as devices so that you can match or mix them to run the app on various platforms. </span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are many of techniques that have come into usage, to test the functional and non-functional aspect of a mobile tool. You need to evaluate them based on their ability to handle the emulators, operating systems and how smoothly they open in multiple browsers. The success for testing automation in mobile applications might vary from the conventional apps. A customized approach to the problem is the key for testing a mobile application tool.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wrap Up!</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While evaluating choosing the right tool for developing a mobile app, one must keep in mind about the various scenarios of a company. For instance: the size of the company, the estimated budget, the existing tool sets used and the kind of in-house teams. Currently, the market is flooded with plethora of mobile applications and hence it becomes confusing for the people to decide the right application.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">To make your dream app and to make it an attractive one among the public, it is necessary to select the right mobile application tools after evaluating the pros and cons of using each one of them. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Over to You</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There might be a number of other strategies or factors that might help a company to select <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/8-mobile-app-development-tools-developers-cant-live-without/">the best mobile application tool</a>; if you have any recommendations or suggestions in improving the mobile application tools, then kindly suggest to us. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In the corporate world, there is a growing trend of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). Employees are advised to bring their own devices to access company’s applications and data. In order to overcome this impediment, many companies are now taking the help of a multi-platform mobile app or what we call in technicals terms, a cross-platform mobile app development to upgrade their current devices and enable it to be used across a wide range of mobile platforms and in different kinds of operating systems.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Cross-Platform Mobile App – A Deeper Understanding</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we talk about cross-platform mobile app development there can be two situations. One can either develop the app on a native platform or develop the app in a singular environment first and then allow it to be used in various native platforms. Cross Development tools use the simplest programming languages like JavaScript, CSS and HTML that makes it easier for the developers to write the core application easily and proves to be a helpful tool for companies offering <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile application development services</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Tools Used For Cross-Platform Mobile App Development</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the tools that are used to make a cross mobile app is code free. Developers do not have to undergo through the tiring process of writing complicated codes. There are a number of tools which makes developing a cross-platform mobile app an easier task. So, let’s take a brief look at all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. PhoneGap</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a free tool which first-time app developers can make use of. PhoneGap can easily translate code from CSS, JavaScript and HTML. They maintain software development kits (SDKs) for every platform on which an app is developed. Apart from developing an app for an iOS or an Android, it lets you to develop apps for Windows and Blackberry as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>What’s special in PhoneGap?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I. The API interface allows the developer to write codes in any language and then converts the code to a native one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">II. It boosts the JavaScript API with an access to important components of a device like GPS and camera.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">III. The UI and the application logic is based on HTML and JavaScript, whereas the other part of the application is based on a native language.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Appcelerator Titanium</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Titanium takes the help of SDK tools in order to create native iOS and android apps by helping you to make use of almost 90% of the code from other apps.

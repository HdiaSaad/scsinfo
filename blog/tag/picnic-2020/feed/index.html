										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any ordinary person, this is just a proverb, but for us at Unified Infotech, this is a mantra. Surely the brilliant minds that are at work here deserve a day of fun and relaxation. And that’s why on the 18th of January 2020, we set out for our annual picnic. Destination? Aqua Retreat at Falta.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing The Destination: Only The Best For Annual SCS INFO Picnic</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a lot of deliberation about the destination, but that’s only because when it comes to our annual picnic, we want only the best. This is why after a lot of deliberation, our organizer committee settled on the picaresque riverside resort &#8211; Aqua Retreat in the outskirts of Kolkata.  </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11705 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beautiful resort right beside the river Ganges was perfect for our day out. A perfect mix between nature and urban locality, our committee decided that it’ll be perfect for the SCS INFO annual picnic. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Journey Starts </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a wintery, foggy and chilly morning, but that doesn’t mean we were going to stop. The participants got to our office at Sector V, Saltlake as early as 7:00 am in the morning. The journey of bus one started at 8:00 am, while the Bus no. 2 started off at 8:30 am.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11737 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2.jpg" alt="SCS INFO picnic" width="1198" height="602" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2.jpg 1198w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2-300x151.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2-768x386.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2-1024x515.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1198px) 100vw, 1198px" /></p>
<p>The way to the picnic spot was long (almost a 3-hour journey, can you imagine!?) but that doesn’t mean we sat idle. No, we made the bus journey a complete fun one with music and games. You can say that we were too excited!</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reaching The Destination</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure during the end of the 3-hour long bus journey, everyone was getting a little antsy. But as soon as that first glance of the river came into view, we knew we were close there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of the place was enough to stun us. The bright sun, the clear sky and the beautiful sight of the river were enough to promise us that the day was going to be an amazing one. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11708 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1204" height="903" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being thoroughly awestruck by the sheer beauty, we decided that this is a day that demands to be seized in the best possible way. So after breakfast (which was really amazing by the way!), we set out to have fun the SCS INFO way (which is a synonym for hardcore fun for us.)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having Fun SCS INFO Style!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work hard and we party equally hard. And when it comes to our annual picnic, you can bet there will be action-packed tournaments and matches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we started off with a power charged badminton match. As our players got more and more into the game, it was impossible to tell who was going to win. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11709 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1204" height="1372" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5-263x300.jpg 263w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5-768x875.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5-899x1024.jpg 899w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus and fun, our players proved that they can do both. As they fought hard to win, they also had an immense amount of fun playing the match. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11710 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-2.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1204" height="677" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-2.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the highly competitive badminton match, cooling down was necessary. And when it comes to relaxing in style, no one does it better than us at Unified Infotech. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11712 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1204" height="803" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the matches were going on, some decided to be the audience and relax on the balcony overlooking the stunning scenery of the river. Another batch decided to just go inside for an impromptu hangout with good food, good music and amazing company of each other.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11713 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200124_112947.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020" width="1261" height="1600" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200124_112947.jpg 1261w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200124_112947-236x300.jpg 236w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200124_112947-768x974.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200124_112947-807x1024.jpg 807w" sizes="(max-width: 1261px) 100vw, 1261px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11714 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01659.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01659.jpg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01659-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01659-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01659-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pool Side Fun</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was a winter day, as the day progressed, the temperature rose a little high. And that became the perfect reason for us to move the party to the poolside. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11716 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat pool side fun" width="1204" height="803" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an impromptu swimming contest (we have no idea who won btw!) to just chilling beside the pool with friends/colleagues, the poolside party became one of the most amazing highlights of the day.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lunch</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the snacks and appetizers served on the first part of the day, it goes without saying that everyone was famished by the time lunch rolled around. It probably had something to do with the amazing food and having too much fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lunch went swimmingly, picnic participants (those who were done with lunch) decided on taking a stroll around the resort and get some amazing scenery shots. By looking at the photos, you can say we have some pro photographers here at Unified Infotech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simple boat on the water makes for an excellent shot.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11718 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat picture clicked by Surajit" width="1152" height="864" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4.jpg 1152w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the sun sets on the horizon, it turns the entire atmosphere into an amazing shade of pink and golden. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not Just A Picnic, But An Opportunity To Bond</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though to many, a picnic is just a picnic, for us at SCS INFO it is a bonding opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a strong believer in the fact that without proper bonding between team members, you can not run the team. And with this small yet significant event, our team became even closer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether we are talking about members of the SCS INFO family who have been here for years, or newcomers, after the picnic, there was no telling, because of the increased bond among us all.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11719 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955.jpg" alt="Selfie time" width="1204" height="903" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you tell from the above picture that there are two fresh newcomers in it? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11720 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008.jpg" alt="Picnic Spot" width="1152" height="532" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008.jpg 1152w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008-1024x473.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old and the new blended together during this event. The bond between the SCS INFO team became stronger, which led us a few more steps closer to achieving our goals of becoming the best in our field.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Day Comes To An End</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saddest thing about the best of the days is the fact that they come to an end. And so did this day. As the sun started dipping in the sky, we too realized that it was time to pack up, both the things we brought with us to the spot, and the amazing memories we made, and start on our way back home. But not without a last group photo! </span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11721 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719.jpg" alt="SCS INFO team picnic" width="1204" height="803" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure we were all a tad bit sad about the day ending. How amazing would it be if we could continue having fun forever!! But that’s not how it goes. So we packed up our stuff, said goodbye to the amazing place, and made a resolution to make the next picnic even better, even more fun, and even more memorable than this one.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moments That Took Our Breath Away!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some amazing moments that took our breath away, and since we care about you all, we thought about sharing as well! Take a look.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11722 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01664.jpg" alt="SCS INFO picnic" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01664.jpg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01664-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01664-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01664-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11724 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-6.jpg" alt="UIPL picnic" width="1204" height="903" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-6.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-6-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire day is definitely going to be a memorable one for all of us at Unified Infotech. The annual picnic for the year 2020 has definitely worked as an energy source, and now we have only one goal in front of us &#8211; to work hard the entire year, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/deloitte-technology-fast-50-winners-2019/">bring more recognition</a> and prepare for another amazing annual getaway next year. </span></p>

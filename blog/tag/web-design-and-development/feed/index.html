										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The term ‘typography’ might sound simple, but very few of us know that it constitutes some major elements like typeface, fonts, line length, leading, tracking and kerning. When it comes to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">web design and development</a>, it’s a strange fact that it’s the typography of a website that brings conversions. Amazed? Yes, readability is an important factor. Your visitors will either struggle to read the copy and leave the website or they will remember it for an eye-catchy design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, in order to master the art of typography, it is important to understand how the target audience reads the information. Most importantly know about the navigation structure. If you are about to start with your next web design project, then you can create a long lasting impression on the client with these web designing typography rules that we are going to share with you in the next few paragraphs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 1: Read Yourself</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have designed a page, look at it from the perspective of a visitor who has just arrived at your web page. Are you feeling comfortable to read? Is the text overlapping on one another? If you encounter any problem, then make sure that the text is readable at least. Make sure that there is adequate space around the letters. It should not be so much overlapping with each other that it looks odd. Look for weird line breaks or any other inconsistency in the typography of the web page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 2: Stop Relying On Dummy Text</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lorem Ipsum is one of the most common things, which designers put whenever there is a dearth of text. If the website is text heavy, then stop putting dummy text. Instead, put the right text. The reason for doing this is in web design and development is that sometimes even a drop cap might modify itself, which might alter the full appearance of the text and disturb the space. You can prevent the text from getting disturbed by creating the perfect design and keeping the required space for design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 3: Maintain The Correct Hierarchy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typography is an art. Use it in a way that it compels the reader to automatically navigate through the web page. Think about how to present the information in a clear and precise manner through improved typefaces for better web design and development. Highlight any vital message or call to action. This will grab the attention of the reader and take him or her to a specific part of the page. In a nutshell, whatever typography you apply the hierarchy should reflect in the website. Go beyond typography and make it interactive for the users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 4: Take Care Of Macro And Micro-Typography</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Understand the difference between micro and macro typography. Micro typography is all about spacing. It determines whether the text is reader friendly or not. On the other hand, macro typography is improving the whole structure of the website and how it appears as compared to the web design. One important thing to keep in mind here is that macro typography gives you the chance to make your text more space. Hence, there’s always an opportunity to make your website stand out in the crowd and make a good name in the web design and development market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 5: Be Careful With The Colours</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re talking here about the Typography colors, not the general website colors as such. One strange thing is that there is no proven fact that a certain color combination will look good. For instance: green color might not be perfect on a green combination. Your visitor might have visited multiple websites before coming to your website. Well, the solution to this is to use a color, which is in complete contrast to the background color. For instance: you can use a light pink text on a background with dark blue colors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 6: CSS Must Be Solid</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make the process of moving between web pages flexible. Use different stylesheets to bring a good effect. For instance: typeface changes and sizes are very crucial while moving between two pages. Follow a consistent font size if you want to keep a simpler CSS. One interesting thing about CSS is that you can maintain consistency across the entire website. It can make or break your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 7: Use Sans Serif For Better Results</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know that when it comes to putting the text on a web page, Sans Serif is just the perfect one to use? If you choose Verdana as the font, there is nothing better than that. Such font was specially designed to make reading easier on a desktop screen. There are high chances of serif fonts’ poor display or even appear blur. One advice would be to choose the fonts intelligently. However, San Serif should be your first preference if you want your project to stand out and give it a unique appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Some additional inputs from our designers…</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our experienced designers at UIPL have a diverse experience while it comes to both <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/">UI and UX design</a>. We share some of the interesting tips, which they have shared.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take a look below</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Text size should be different in various resolutions for better web design and development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier text shadow and glow wasn’t allowed for typography in iOS, but now it’s allowed. Hence, make the best use if it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The interface should be user –friendly. Earlier, listing images were in use, but now there has been an improvement in customization with the use of separate pop-ups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The material design has come to the usage for the shorter element.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The trend of using gradient color is no more the trend. Use of solid colors is on the rise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use square sized icon for an iPhone application. While using any outlines, make use that it is colorful and looks appealing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap up!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only designers can understand the role which typography plays in web design and development. It might appear a very subtle topic to us but it plays a very vital role. Arranging the elements of the web page in accordance with the typeface is the best way to create a great impression on the visitors of the website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The usage of storage has moved beyond personal purposes today. It is slowly making an entry in the corporate world and is making a significant contribution to an all round development in the information technology sector. Leveraging the multiple benefits of cloud computing, organizations are moving towards adopting advanced technologies, which is leading them towards a rapid phase of <a title="Web Design and Development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>web design and development</strong>.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Switching to cloud enables an enterprise to deploy applications faster, respond to the customer requirements and meet with their growing demands; at the same time, it can also respond to any opportunity. In fact, a survey done by KPMG found out that 42% respondents wanted to use cloud to improve their workforce, whereas 37% of them wanted to use it to communicate clearly with their clientele.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shifting the underlying servers to the cloud might cause a discrepancy in the user experience, but this will definitely be fruitful in the long-term. Currently, Saas (Software as a Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) are the happening services in the industry, but now the trend is currently shifting towards the Paas (Platform as a Service) model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The spectacular benefit that Cloud has offered to the corporate sector is noteworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Necessity Of Cloud In Today’s Changing Business Scenario </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cloud computing is more than a necessity to a business house today. Integrating it with the functionalities of a company is thus necessary, but how does it produce the fruits of benefits for your business is really a matter of concern. Now, let us see how cloud computing is like a golden egg put in a farmer’s basket for a business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Flexible To Use</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from cost cutting, an important concern that bothers large organizations is to increase their capability and operations in order to cater to the demands of customers. Opting for a cloud architecture reduces the hassle of using physical servers to transfer data easily. One doesn’t need to depend on the applications or software anymore. The scale of operations can easily go up once you opt for the cloud services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Faster Deployments</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the use of cloud might not have a direct impact on the performance of the application but one can realize the benefit of them very easily. Now, one can create environments much faster. This will be beneficial for the developers as they can devote their time to productive work. Cloud Applications are meant to ease the process of web development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Less Dependency On Servers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Cloud,’ the name itself signifies huge storage whether it is about storing sensitive information of the organization or any other important documents. One can cut down administrative expenses to a large extent in the data center, redeploy servers which previously hosted applications but have now moved to a shared model basis. Whether you want to develop or test a mobile application, Cloud computing is just the perfect choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reduce Manpower</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The robustness of cloud computing is such that it reduces almost half the size of the manpower. Since the number of servers is reduced, it requires lesser manpower to be deployed which ultimately leads to cost cutting. So, if your’s is a company which is planning to make cuts in the manpower, then cloud computing is the ultimate solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By now, you must have come to know the role of cloud in today’s emerging business. It would not be wrong to say that cloud migration leads to business transformation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Don’t Make These Mistakes While Migrating To Cloud</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While migrating your business to cloud computing, it is very obvious that you might make some mistakes that might not be intentional. We do not want that you should commit the same mistakes and will, therefore, let you know those mistakes so that you can avoid them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, it is important for you to know what type of cloud is your organization going to use. Remember, there are four types of clouds that one uses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. <strong>Private</strong>: This is made for private organizations and can be built either on site or off site. Such type of cloud services offer infrastructure services and virtualized applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong>Public</strong>: Such cloud computing services can be accessed by anybody and is normally owned by a third party.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. <strong>Hybrid</strong>: They are a combination of private and public. While an organization can maintain all their data in the private cloud, on the other hand, it also provides access to other cloud computing services as well, which can be accessed by anybody.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. <strong>Community</strong>: This is shared by a number of companies within the same industry. Any expenses related to the cloud are distributed within the users. A community cloud is hosted normally by third parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, that you are accustomed to the kinds of clouds available, let’s delve deeper and know about the mistakes which one does while migrating to the cloud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mistake 1</strong>: <strong>Selling Off Existing Hardware</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have shifted to the cloud, you normally tend to throw them off or remove it entirely from your office premises, but this is a wrong thing to do. The market for used computers is worth $300 billion, so why not earn some revenue?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mistake 2</strong>: <strong>Shifting All Apps To Cloud</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Migrating to the cloud doesn’t mean that you will have to shift all your apps to the cloud. It depends on the industry and its requirements, which decide whether they are to be migrated to the cloud, or not. A healthcare organization in the case should study their requirement first and then decide whether to shift their app to the cloud or not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mistake 3</strong>: <strong>Not Making The Apps ‘Cloud-Ready</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is your app cloud ready? this is the first question which you must decide while shifting to the cloud. Make sure that your apps run equally well on the cloud server like the way it runs in an in-house data center by accessing the entire computing power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mistake 4</strong>: <strong>Not Doing Your Homework</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You have to be aware of the IT requirements of a cloud before you go for it. Once you are confident about your infrastructure and usages, then you can decide which cloud you want to go for – Private, Public or Community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mistake 5</strong>: <strong>Not Paying Attention To Big Data</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Big enterprises are often skeptical about the large chunk of information they have in their database. The problem arises at that time when the size of data exceeds terabytes. Well, the solution, in this case, is to transfer all such data to the cloud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping these five things in mind will make you aware of the various strategies you should adopt in order to avoid the mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are not able to manage the cloud operations of your business, then you can rely on us. All you have to do is just drop a mail to us at <a href="mailto:info@unifiedinfotech.net">info@unifiedinfotech.net</a> with your requirement and we will contact you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The collaboration of technology and business is something, which cannot be overlooked. Both of them have delivered results that have helped brands to grow larger and establish themselves as a premier marketing organization. There has been a huge shift in the digital world with the ongoing transformation that is taking place. Marketers these days are allocating a considerable portion of their budget behind web development. According to a research done by Gartner in 2015, it was found that marketers spend 61% of their budget. The figure is an indication of how important technology is to a company. Marketers these days are constantly figuring out ways and methods to move ahead of their competitors and technology is one of the ways.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Some significant problems faced by the companies such as bad website performance, data analytics and security can no longer be considered as an IT problem. They are now considered to be a part of the </span><a title="Web Design and Development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>web design and development</b></span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">. After an intensive research, team <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">Unified</a> has come up with the technologies, which you need to adopt today to ensure positive results for your business.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Frameworks</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">They are the foundation of a programming language that makes the process of writing programming languages easier. They help to eliminate the tough task of setting up a new web application. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We recommend you to use the following frameworks for your business</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/ruby-on-rails-for-your-website/"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ruby on Rails</span></a></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Ionic</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Bootstarp</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">WordPress</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Backbone.js</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Ember.js</span></li>
<li><a title="Angularjs Development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-angularjs-developers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;">Angular.js</span></a></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">.NET</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Drupal </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Meteor</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-nodejs-developer/"><span style="font-size: medium;">Node.js</span></a></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Programming Language</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Without a programming language, it becomes impossible for the developer to work because this is the only mode of communication with the computers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We recommend you to use the following programming languages for your business</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Java</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Swift</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Objective-C</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Go</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">PHP</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Ruby</span></li>

<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Javascript</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Browser </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Browser establishes the communication between humans and the virtual world. They are the window to the digital world. For your business to succeed it is important to have the right browser.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We recommend you to use the following browsers for your business</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Safari</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Google Chrome</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Firefox</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Databases</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Databases store all your important data of your company along with the applications. Starting at the record of employees to the information of accounts or fixed assets without a database your business cannot survive. Similarly even in a technology company, it is imperative to have advanced databases. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We recommend you to use the following databases for your business</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Libraries </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While writing complicated codes, libraries are something that proves to be of immense helpful. They ease the process of development as the developer doesn’t have to go through the tiring stage of writing code. We recommend you to use Underscore and jQuery in order to get optimum output.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>If you want to successfully implement these web development technologies then it is necessary to take some important things into consideration. These are mandatory things to follow if you want to implement the web development technologies in your organization.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Focus on Performance</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Loading time of a website is an important matter of consideration. It is true that a website which takes ten seconds to load is slow, but nowadays, it’s a completely different scenario. If a web page doesn’t open within 10 seconds, then visitors will leave your website and open a competitor’s website. The slow performance of a website not only hamper the reputation of a website, but it will also lure away traffic from the website and reduce their trust in your brand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Consider Privacy </b></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Infinite opportunities have grown when it comes to web development. The doors of technology have opened the gates of development. With several options for customizations, Laravel has clearly emerged as one of the winners when it comes to developing a website. Most of the entrepreneurs today, prefer Laravel when it comes to selecting the best open source PHP web framework. It gives a boost when it comes to developing applications using the model view controller architectural pattern. Hence, it would not be wrong to say that it eases the process of <a title="web design and development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><b>web design and development</b></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether it is about using object-oriented libraries or the number of useful extensions, it has always given its fruits of benefits to all those who have used it, but did you ever wonder how does it ease the process of web development? Well, we present to you some of the important reasons that explain how this <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/uipl-will-let-you-know-how-to-choose-the-best-mv-framework/">MVC framework</a> acts as a catalyst in web development.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Easy Authentication </b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to implement authentication, then Laravel is the best choice for you. Each and every file is configured for you. It includes many well-documented options in the form of config/auth.php that helps to twist the performance of many authentication services. Moreover, it also enables you to completely customize the website according to your requirements. Being backed by a powerful tool like PHP, it has the ability to transform your business to a genius.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Makes Unit Testing Easier</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the key benefits of Laravel is that it while it runs unit tests, the configuration environment is automatically set to testing. Separate configuration files are created for cache and session. They tend to array the testing environment; which means that there will be no cache or session data while testing. One can create separate data in cache even while testing. In addition to this, there is a separate Testcase class to make the method of testing easier.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>ORM Models Simplify The Database</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an ActiveRecord implementation, the ORM models of Laravel create a great working environment in the database. You can find a separate ‘model’ in each of the databases that in turn helps you to enter new records in the table. In case, you do not find a model, you can use the primary key – App::error to display a 404 page. It allows you to specify the database connection while running a query on Eloquent.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Homestead For A Delightful Experience</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No need to install PHP, HHVM or any kind of web server, in your machine because Laravel Homestead comes loaded with Vagrant box that enables you to manage your operating system without any problem. The best part is that it runs on any type of operating system whether it is Mac, Linux or Windows. The inclusion of other frameworks such as MySQL, Node or Memcached allows you to develop awesome applications of Laravel.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Why Should You Prefer Laravel Over Other PHP Networks ?</b></i></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to a survey done by Sitepoint in 2015, Laravel emerged as one of the most popular frameworks in the workplace (see image below)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now let us study the reasons why Laravel is one of the most preferred ones when it comes to selecting the best framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laravel 4, the recent version has come up with a number of helpful features make it the hot favorite among developers.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hassle Free Database Migrations </b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laravel is a great way to sync databases. It allows you to keep the data in seeds and migrations. As far as another framework like MySQL is concerned, it might not be the best option to transfer the changes made in the databases through development machines. You can also supervise the database and keep it under your control.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Artisan Opens Ample Options </b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Command line is an important part of the web development process and acts as an important tool for the web developers. With the help of Artisan, one can run various tasks through the command line. Type, ‘php artisan’ in the terminal window and there will be multiple options for you. Since, it is driven by the Symphony Console component, you get a number of options for developing a web application.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Manage Dependency With Composer</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laravel acts as a dependency management system. Whenever you install them in a directory, they start dealing with libraries and ‘packages’ by managing them on a per project basis. To explain this, let’s take an example. Suppose you maintain a project that requires many libraries and those libraries depend on another set of libraries. Here, comes the role of the Composer. It helps you to declare the libraries after finding out the versions where they are to be inserted.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Robustness of Laravel in the Modern World</b></i></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than 80% of the websites around the world today, runs on PHP and Laravel is the hero among them. Amidst the multiple PHP frameworks that are available in the market today, Laravel is the undisputed leader as far as large-scale <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web application development is concerned</a>. You can easily execute any large scale project within few days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run, Forrest, Run!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I’m not going to talk about Forrest Gump here! But I’m just taking the reference of “running”. And I’m going to share with you all how we, the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">UIPL family</a> participated in a recently organized marathon and enjoyed the event throughout the day. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Quick Sneak Peek to “Green Marathon”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBI, our nation-wide renowned Public Sector Bank organized a “Green Marathon” across 15 different cities in India. And it had its Kolkata edition on 23rd February 2020. Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM, another renowned brand of the nation took the initiative of this one of the biggest marathon events in the “City of Joy”. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12163 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sbi-green-marathon.png" alt="sbi green marathon" width="601" height="537" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sbi-green-marathon.png 601w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sbi-green-marathon-300x268.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p><b>Venue Details of the Event: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eco Park Gate 1, AA II, Deshbandhu Nagar, Newtown, Kolkata</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have followed our blog archive, you are probably already aware that at UIPL, we do not always work only. We believe in the “work smart, party hard” motto. So, we arrange games, employee outings, competitions with fun-filled activities, and take part in different events around the city whenever possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, when we got to know about this big marathon event, our management instantly decided to be a part of it. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Greater Cause Behind The Event</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The greener future” &#8211; we all dream about it, right? A cleaner environment, a greener city, breathing fresh year &#8211; all these seem like a fiction in today’s busy world. Pollution and global warming are always in the limelight. These issues are always in the headlines!</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12164 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-1024x682.jpg" alt="forest trees perspective bright" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, in such chaos and amidst so much of negativity, when an event is organized to promote a “greener future”, how can we not be a part of it? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12165 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Green Tree" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the main objective of organizing the “Green Marathon” is showing our commitment towards the greener and fresher environment and sustainable development. And this was indeed a “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">zero-waste</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” event. And being the responsible citizens, we took part in it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if I were to flaunt how physical activities like running can help us, I would have come up with a long list of benefits. Not only better physical health but our finer mental health, enriched soul, personal development &#8211; everything comes from physical activities like running. And not to forget, there is fun too. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Event Day</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, in Kolkata, shivering cold is not an issue in February and that too around the third week of the month. But this year, it was a bit of an exception. And the “Global Warming” caused by us only was one of the main reasons behind it. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12166 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-1024x767.jpeg" alt="UIPL team" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, beating the “not-so-freezing” cold, we all reached the venue within the reporting time i.e. 5:45 AM. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different Running Categories</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the entire marathon event had different categories based on the total distance to be covered. The three different categories were:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12167 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-1024x767.jpeg" alt="uipl team 1" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21 km</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 km</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 km</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for different categories the reporting time and the flag off time were different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our UIPL family participated in the 5 km marathon. So, our reporting time and flag off time were 5:45 AM and 6:45 AM respectively. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Glimpse of the Ambiance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be amazed to know that around 7,500 participants came that day to participate along with us. Even if it was Sunday, people from different backgrounds and different ages came together to pledge for a greener future.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12168 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-1024x649.jpg" alt="uipl team 2" width="1024" height="649" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-1024x649.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-768x487.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gold medalist of the Asian Games, an IPS officer, the first Bengali mountaineer too came to participate. So, from the very beginning, we all felt so energized to see so many enthusiastic and energetic faces around us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the event organizing partners just nailed it. The arrangements were huge. Every participant got t-shirts. And you know what all the t-shirts were organic. The main objective was to promote a greener and cleaner city. And the bibs we all got there consisted of seeds for tree plantation. Sounds cool right? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12169 " src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/green-marathon.png" alt="green marathon" width="853" height="580" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/green-marathon.png 691w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/green-marathon-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Source: https://ibgnews.com</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, on every checkpoint, there were water stations. It is not like everyone can start and finish maintaining the same pace. So, keeping that in mind, there were enough water stations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we got mouth-watering food packets as well after the marathon was over.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Our UIPL Team Performed There </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, even though we clicked a lot of photos together and enjoyed ourselves before starting the marathon and post-marathon while running, not every one of us was together! </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12170 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-1024x767.jpeg" alt="green marathon 1" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our developers put on his headphones to listen to some kickass music while running. Another developer was fully concentrating on the run! I’m sure rest performed well too because all of them got their medals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be amazed to know that each of our superwomen at the office, who participated that day, completed the entire 5 km run within the allotted time too. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12172 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-1024x767.jpeg" alt="uipl team 3" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, yes, after that kind of achievement, we all want to flaunt our medals! </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Feeling of Achievement</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it is not like every one of us regularly exercise (which is not a very good thing though!). To some extent, our busy lifestyle is kind of responsible for that. Still, when we got an opportunity like this, we could not afford to miss it.</p>
<p></span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12173 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-1024x767.jpeg" alt="uipl team 4" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
See, how the happy faces look! Being able to be a part of a greater and better cause, we all are very happy indeed. And the feeling of an accomplished achievement is clearly visible in our faces! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, we all will plant the seed we got. And if you have reached this far while reading, I would like to request you too that please plant more trees. Also, encourage people to do so and make your city greener, cleaner, and a better place to live. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping Up</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, this was our story to make this world a better place even if it is a tiny one. But to reach a goal, you need to start taking your steps right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UIPL, we always encourage this type of activity. Also, such gatherings help us to make our network stronger. Meeting new people comes with new opportunities. Thinking in this way helps us to grow together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t want to be the “Jack”, who is a “dull boy”! So, both work and play are important to us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that was all for our “Green Marathon” day out. I will keep you posted about our next events too. Till then you can follow us for any technology and development-related news, updates, releases, and guides.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when the season of Holi (the festival of colors), a group of extremely competitive people, and the tradition of rangoli come together? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why a Holi special Rangoli competition!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When our amazing HR team revealed the idea of the Rangoli competition to us on the 2nd of March, the entire office geared themselves up for a fun-filled competition. With 7 teams ready with colors and unique design, the competition on the 6th of March was not only fun but intense as well. </span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12111 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech.jpeg" alt="rangoli competition at unified infotech" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech.jpeg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech-1024x576.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Competition Begins</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competitive and artistic spirits of all 7 teams that participated showed up when the competition began at 1:00 pm. Whether the competitors have an artistic streak or not, everyone got ready. Assembled at the designated place of the competition, we all arranged our colors and other instruments necessary to create the designs that will fetch us in the first place!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there was only 30 minutes allotted for the entire competition, the atmosphere in the room was definitely charged. Teamwork became the most important thing to create rangolis in a fast and precise manner.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team B pouring all colours of effort and hard work into their rangoli.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not Just Competition, But A Chance To Have Fun</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted it was a competition, and of course, all of us wanted to win, but that doesn’t mean we didn’t have fun! With the colors and good company, the competition became more fun than ever! </span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12114 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F.jpeg" alt="rangoli team F" width="1056" height="792" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F.jpeg 1056w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F-1024x768.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1056px) 100vw, 1056px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team A working together to win the competition. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Winners</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though each rangoli was a piece of unique art in itself, we had to pick three winning teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first place went to Team B. It was unsurprising because Team B mainly comprised of our best designers, and that makes it kind of obvious that they will be the ones to win the rangoli competition. Their design reflected the colorful spirit of the celebration itself. Not to mention they were the most prepared team of all, prepared with colors and design from the beginning. </span><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second place was grabbed by Team A. The enthusiasm, spirit, and experience in making rangolis paid off as they took the bag of goodies for second place in the competition. Their rangoli explored the unique blend of colors and the auspicious image of Ganesha was created to not only drive the team to do better in the competition, but also to bring good fortune to the company!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not the least, the third prize went to Team E for their amazing peacock rangoli. The peacock rangoli with the SCS INFO logo in the middle represented the idea of being one with the beauty and grace of the bird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rangoli competition was one of the many more festivities and celebrations to come this year.

And now, we only wait for the next festivity to come around while working to become the best in our field. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any ordinary person, this is just a proverb, but for us at Unified Infotech, this is a mantra. Surely the brilliant minds that are at work here deserve a day of fun and relaxation. And that’s why on the 18th of January 2020, we set out for our annual picnic. Destination? Aqua Retreat at Falta.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing The Destination: Only The Best For Annual SCS INFO Picnic</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a lot of deliberation about the destination, but that’s only because when it comes to our annual picnic, we want only the best. This is why after a lot of deliberation, our organizer committee settled on the picaresque riverside resort &#8211; Aqua Retreat in the outskirts of Kolkata.  </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11705 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beautiful resort right beside the river Ganges was perfect for our day out. A perfect mix between nature and urban locality, our committee decided that it’ll be perfect for the SCS INFO annual picnic. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Journey Starts </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a wintery, foggy and chilly morning, but that doesn’t mean we were going to stop. The participants got to our office at Sector V, Saltlake as early as 7:00 am in the morning. The journey of bus one started at 8:00 am, while the Bus no. 2 started off at 8:30 am.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11737 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2.jpg" alt="SCS INFO picnic" width="1198" height="602" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2.jpg 1198w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2-300x151.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2-768x386.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2-1024x515.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1198px) 100vw, 1198px" /></p>
<p>The way to the picnic spot was long (almost a 3-hour journey, can you imagine!?) but that doesn’t mean we sat idle. No, we made the bus journey a complete fun one with music and games. You can say that we were too excited!</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reaching The Destination</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure during the end of the 3-hour long bus journey, everyone was getting a little antsy. But as soon as that first glance of the river came into view, we knew we were close there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of the place was enough to stun us. The bright sun, the clear sky and the beautiful sight of the river were enough to promise us that the day was going to be an amazing one. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11708 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1204" height="903" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being thoroughly awestruck by the sheer beauty, we decided that this is a day that demands to be seized in the best possible way. So after breakfast (which was really amazing by the way!), we set out to have fun the SCS INFO way (which is a synonym for hardcore fun for us.)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having Fun SCS INFO Style!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work hard and we party equally hard. And when it comes to our annual picnic, you can bet there will be action-packed tournaments and matches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we started off with a power charged badminton match. As our players got more and more into the game, it was impossible to tell who was going to win. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11709 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1204" height="1372" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5-263x300.jpg 263w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5-768x875.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5-899x1024.jpg 899w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus and fun, our players proved that they can do both. As they fought hard to win, they also had an immense amount of fun playing the match. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the highly competitive badminton match, cooling down was necessary. And when it comes to relaxing in style, no one does it better than us at Unified Infotech. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11712 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1204" height="803" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the matches were going on, some decided to be the audience and relax on the balcony overlooking the stunning scenery of the river. Another batch decided to just go inside for an impromptu hangout with good food, good music and amazing company of each other.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11713 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200124_112947.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020" width="1261" height="1600" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200124_112947.jpg 1261w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200124_112947-236x300.jpg 236w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200124_112947-768x974.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200124_112947-807x1024.jpg 807w" sizes="(max-width: 1261px) 100vw, 1261px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11714 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01659.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01659.jpg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01659-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01659-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01659-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pool Side Fun</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was a winter day, as the day progressed, the temperature rose a little high. And that became the perfect reason for us to move the party to the poolside. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11716 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat pool side fun" width="1204" height="803" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an impromptu swimming contest (we have no idea who won btw!) to just chilling beside the pool with friends/colleagues, the poolside party became one of the most amazing highlights of the day.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lunch</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the snacks and appetizers served on the first part of the day, it goes without saying that everyone was famished by the time lunch rolled around. It probably had something to do with the amazing food and having too much fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lunch went swimmingly, picnic participants (those who were done with lunch) decided on taking a stroll around the resort and get some amazing scenery shots. By looking at the photos, you can say we have some pro photographers here at Unified Infotech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simple boat on the water makes for an excellent shot.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11718 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat picture clicked by Surajit" width="1152" height="864" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4.jpg 1152w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the sun sets on the horizon, it turns the entire atmosphere into an amazing shade of pink and golden. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not Just A Picnic, But An Opportunity To Bond</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though to many, a picnic is just a picnic, for us at SCS INFO it is a bonding opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a strong believer in the fact that without proper bonding between team members, you can not run the team. And with this small yet significant event, our team became even closer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether we are talking about members of the SCS INFO family who have been here for years, or newcomers, after the picnic, there was no telling, because of the increased bond among us all.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11719 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955.jpg" alt="Selfie time" width="1204" height="903" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you tell from the above picture that there are two fresh newcomers in it? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11720 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008.jpg" alt="Picnic Spot" width="1152" height="532" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008.jpg 1152w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008-1024x473.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old and the new blended together during this event. The bond between the SCS INFO team became stronger, which led us a few more steps closer to achieving our goals of becoming the best in our field.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Day Comes To An End</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saddest thing about the best of the days is the fact that they come to an end. And so did this day. As the sun started dipping in the sky, we too realized that it was time to pack up, both the things we brought with us to the spot, and the amazing memories we made, and start on our way back home. But not without a last group photo! </span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11721 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719.jpg" alt="SCS INFO team picnic" width="1204" height="803" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure we were all a tad bit sad about the day ending. How amazing would it be if we could continue having fun forever!! But that’s not how it goes. So we packed up our stuff, said goodbye to the amazing place, and made a resolution to make the next picnic even better, even more fun, and even more memorable than this one.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moments That Took Our Breath Away!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some amazing moments that took our breath away, and since we care about you all, we thought about sharing as well! Take a look.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11722 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01664.jpg" alt="SCS INFO picnic" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01664.jpg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01664-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01664-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01664-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11724 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-6.jpg" alt="UIPL picnic" width="1204" height="903" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-6.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-6-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire day is definitely going to be a memorable one for all of us at Unified Infotech. The annual picnic for the year 2020 has definitely worked as an energy source, and now we have only one goal in front of us &#8211; to work hard the entire year, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/deloitte-technology-fast-50-winners-2019/">bring more recognition</a> and prepare for another amazing annual getaway next year. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best time of the year is here again! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I’m not saying it because of Christmas or New Year&#8217;s Eve. Those are too mainstream now! At </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/"><b>Unified Infotech</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we have a separate fanbase for the Unified Premier League (UPL). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, just like Football and Cricket World Cup, every year, the UIPL family eagerly waits for this cricket tournament. And the most-loving fact is that we don’t even have to wait for 4 years for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, on 28th December 2019, Saturday, our UIPL family witnessed the most-awaited cricket tournament of our organization. And with high team spirit and sheer skills and excellence, </span><b>Fire Hunks won the UPL 2019 Cup</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, if you are thinking UPL is like just another random employee recreational activity, let me correct you! The emotions, passions, dedications, and excitement attached to UPL is nothing less than the World Cup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me take you through the journey of the Unified Premier League (UPL). And you’ll know how much UPL means to the UIPL family. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planning Warm-Up </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not like we just plan things within one week and head out to play. Every successful organization plans well before taking one-step. And for UPL, we do the same. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11592" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11592" style="width: 1603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11592 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Match-Day-UPL.jpg" alt="The Match Day UPL" width="1603" height="1241" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Match-Day-UPL.jpg 1603w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Match-Day-UPL-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Match-Day-UPL-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Match-Day-UPL-1024x793.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1603px) 100vw, 1603px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11592" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of the year, we decide on which day the Unified Premier League is going to take place. And accordingly, we book the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But organizing a cricket tournament is much more than that. We have to print flex and banners, prepare cup and medals for the winning team players. Also, there are food and drink arrangements for everyone including the players and the spectators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything needs well-organized planning. So, for that, we build a committee that takes care of all these. This committee also takes care of all the necessary cricket equipment too.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Teams</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have four cricket teams.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fire Hunks</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On the RockX</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pitch Smashers</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified Super Kings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each team has 9 players. A total of 7 cricket matches are there. And each game is of 10 overs.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, not everyone can join the team. We enlist the names of interested candidates. Then they go through months of training and practice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may wonder how everyone gets so much time! Well, that’s the spirit of UIPL family. Everyone gives their best efforts and dedication to the work. And after that, they manage time to do exercise and play practice matches as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, team captains are selected by votes. And then team players are chosen through the UPL auction. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battle Day</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">28th December 2019, Saturday</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shivering cold. Chilly and foggy weather. Yes, that’s how the early morning of 28th December of 2019 was. But the game was on!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reporting time to reach the ground was 7.30 am. And the game spirit defeated the cold and chilly weather. Every player reached the ground by sharp 7.30 am. And the game was about to start by sharp at 8 am. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Game Is On</span></h3>
<p><b>1st Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tournament’s favorite team </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the RockX</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> played the 1st match. And the game ended with a shock! The tournament’s favorite team lost to its opponent. </span></p>
<p><b>2nd Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second match was between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defeated the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the game. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, I would love to mention one name i.e. Israfil, one of our very skilled developers. We all knew about his coding skills, but we got to know about his commentary skills on the match day. It wouldn’t have been the same without his hilarious commentary during the matches. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11601 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-2.jpg" alt="Prize Distribution" width="1920" height="1039" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-2.jpg 1920w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-2-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-2-768x416.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-2-1024x554.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breakfast Time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the end of the 2nd match, the ambiance was entirely set. Most of the spectators reached the ground at that time. More interestingly, many outsiders were also enjoying the cricket tournament. So, everyone was on the vibes of the Unified Premier league.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breakfast packets were served to everyone after the 2nd match. I saw </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were having breakfast with their respective team players. Maybe they were talking about strategies! Because 3rd match was between these two teams only. And to keep their hopes alive to play the final, they had to win this match anyhow.</span></p>
<p><b>3rd Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the 3rd match started with so many spectators cheering for both teams on the ground. And the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> literally smashed the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our Marketing Team’s Tanmay gave an amazing performance in the match with 47 runs. </span></p>
<p><b>4th Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By winning the 4th match against </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the RockX</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went straight into the Final under the brilliant captaincy of Partha, one of our beloved and experienced designers. </span></p>
<p><b>5th Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the deciding match for who is going to be the other finalist between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the RockX</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And with a killer performance of the team, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won the match and became the 2nd finalist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanmay got injured during this match. But with the great sportsman spirit and with the help of the doctor we had in the ground, he continued playing. And he confirmed he would play in the final as well. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Final Phase of The Cricket Tournament</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we had two most deserving finalists of the tournament &#8211; the unbeaten </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the team that continually won every match after their first loss, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had another cricket match between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the RockX</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to decide who is going to take the third place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before these two remaining matches, lunch was served to everyone. After the breathtaking matches, the lunch seemed the most delicious thing we ever had. The tournament management committee arranged for finger-licking chicken dish with roti and soft energy drinks for everyone present in the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, after lunch, we were all set for the final phase of the cricket tournament. </span></p>
<p><b>6th Match for the 3rd Place</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the last chance for the team </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get the feeling of victory for once in the tournament. The team On the RockX didn’t take their opponent lightly just because they didn&#8217;t win any game so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many tensed supporters around them, the game started. However, it seemed luck didn’t work for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that day. And after giving a tough fight, they lost to their opponent team. And we got our UPL’s 3rd place winner </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the RockX</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Final Match of Unified Premier League (UPL)</span></h2>
<p><b>Fire Hunks vs Pitch Smashers </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was super excited about the final because two of the most deserving teams were playing it. With spectators cheering and clapping, the match started. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won the toss. And the captain chose to field first. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had some great batsmen who were already on form and did well in the previous matches. Everyone was looking forward to witnessing some great batting from the team captain Abhishek. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, things didn’t go really well for them. Abhishek got out on a full toss delivery by the opponent team captain Partha! When the situation became tense, Tanmay and Rajat, another skilled and experienced developer of our UIPL family showed their expertise on the ground.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11595 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/one-of-our-man-of-the-matches-762x1024.jpg" alt="Prize Distribution" width="762" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/one-of-our-man-of-the-matches-762x1024.jpg 762w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/one-of-our-man-of-the-matches-223x300.jpg 223w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/one-of-our-man-of-the-matches-768x1032.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/one-of-our-man-of-the-matches.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their partnership helped </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to score 90 runs in 10 overs. So, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had to do 91 runs in 10 overs to win the cup. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started the match with a bit slow-paced runs. It was almost 5 pm. So, the ground was becoming kinda wet with dew. Thus, doing batting became a bit tough for the players of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They had to do 47 runs from 36 balls.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11599 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-21-1-935x1024.jpg" alt="Prize Distribution" width="935" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-21-1-935x1024.jpg 935w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-21-1-274x300.jpg 274w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-21-1-768x841.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-21-1.jpg 1121w" sizes="(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a bit of drama, the finale is never exciting. And this year’s UPL final didn’t disappoint anyone present on the ground. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11600 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-18-846x1024.jpg" alt="Prize Distribution" width="846" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-18-846x1024.jpg 846w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-18-248x300.jpg 248w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-18-768x929.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-18.jpg 1058w" sizes="(max-width: 846px) 100vw, 846px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things became really tense when </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had to do 13 runs from 10 balls. With 3 wickets in hand, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needed 8 runs to win from 7 balls. Nobody was sure what would happen. And that’s the beauty of cricket! </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11594 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cricket-pic-2-min.png" alt="Prize Distribution" width="1650" height="1276" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won the match in a legendary style! Subhajyoti, one of our talented Project Managers hit the winning 6. And with 3 wickets in hand and 5 balls remaining, the team won the </span><b>Unified Premier League 2019 Cup</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awards and Awestruck Moments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Champions hold the cup high in their hands! </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remained unbeaten till the end of the tournament. For the brilliant performance in the final match, Santu, a talented developer in our UIPL family, won the award for “The Man of the Match”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, we all spent an eventful day. We took a lot of photos together. And we made great memories together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How important employee recreational activities are in an organization needs no special mention. In today’s busy world, managing the work-life balance has become pretty tough for almost everyone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such a scenario, such activities and events are like a breath of fresh air. It reduces the stress of work pressure, makes the workplace interesting and better. Also, it is great for improving team morale in the workplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why I would like to say a big thanks to our event planning committee for arranging such a big and successful cricket tournament.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the festive time is not over yet. We have our official picnic in the next few days. Surely, I will share the fun and interesting stories and moments of our picnic soon. </span></p>

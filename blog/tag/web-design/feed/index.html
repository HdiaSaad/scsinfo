										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the UI/UX design world, wireframes are like blueprints. Whether it is a website or a mobile app, UX wireframe design is the most necessary step.</p>
<p>Whether you are a new entrepreneur, or an experienced businessman, wireframing is something you&#8217;ve heard of. It is the basic rough sketch made before the product goes in for complete design and development.</p>
<p>But is that all there is to wireframing?</p>
<p>When it comes to achieving the client&#8217;s design dreams, a product design wireframe is the first step we take. And we can tell from experience that wireframing is not just a basic rough sketch. So what more is it? Let&#8217;s explore!</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: justify;">1. What Is Wireframe Design?</h2>
<p>The static skeletal foundation, a.k.a wireframes are the base of any creative design operation. The barebone versions of platform UI helps designers &amp; developers to understand some key factors. These factors include but are not limited to- core functionality, features, basic navigation flow, and the overall impact of the idea on the end-user.</p>
<p>It is a popular opinion that the wireframe design process is not detail-oriented, but that is not true. When it comes to this specific process, the devil lies in the right details. It is a process that deals with the visual aspect of the entire process. And that&#8217;s why designers must pay attention to user needs and journey-related information.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13208" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-1024x768.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Having the users in mind from the very beginning helps us to create an impactful design. Our skilled team of designers uses this part of modern web design to determine the navigation flow of the platform. In doing so, we can examine the user flow within the platform from very early on. The black &amp; white framework, made with simple boxes and lines represents design elements and content hierarchy. It is the perfect way of getting client approval on the design concept before beginning the process.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Expert speaks</strong>: Rather than focusing on visual details, it is more critical to pay attention to interaction, information hierarchy &amp; content placement. So don’t fret too much about how the finished product will look. Rather focus on the right placement design elements during this stage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: justify;">2. Why Is Wireframing A Must?</h2>
<p>Surely the design process for your business platform can proceed without wireframing. So why is it an essential element practiced by almost every <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/website-design/">modern web design company</a>?</p>
<p>There are many benefits of this simple method. And these benefits make wireframing a vital part of design success. So let us list out a few reasons why we think it is important to design app wireframes before development.</p>
<h3>A. Provides A Solid Design Foundation</h3>
<p>Having a well-defined material design wireframe gives our designers a solid foundation to work on. The wireframe blueprint assists us to recognize the core functionality of the platform, and design an impactful UI that matches its purpose.</p>
<h3>B. Helps Gather Feedback &amp; Implement Them</h3>
<p>During our kick-off &amp; analytical stage, we use UI/UX design wireframes to gather valuable client opinions. This feedback gives us deeper insight into our client&#8217;s requirements and enables us to build a better platform.</p>
<h3>C. Reduces The Chance Of Costly Redesign</h3>
<p>A client-approved landing page wireframe design works as the perfect guide to creating designs that are impactful for a long time. And that&#8217;s why we use this step to ensure the clients don&#8217;t have to go through a costly redesign process later on.</p>
<h3>D. Increases Functional Efficiency From An Early Stage</h3>
<p>Software design wireframes help us to map out the navigational flow, which in turn improves the overall functional efficiency of the platform. With this step, we ensure that the consumers find the necessary information on the platform easily.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: justify;">3. A Step-By-Step Look The Types Of Wireframes</h2>
<p>Based on the detailing, we can distinguish three different kinds of wireframe design-</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-fidelity</li>
<li>Mid fidelity</li>
<li>High fidelity</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see what each of these include-</p>
<h3>A. Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
<p>Low-fidelity wireframes outline what the basic interface looks like. These rough sketches, mostly done with pen and paper, help to begin the design conversation between the clients and the designers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13209" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-1024x768.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As rough sketches, this kind of user experience design wireframes lacks the image and color element. Low-fidelity frameworks are used to understand and map out the interface, as well as the user flow from one page to another. It also helps to decide quickly between multiple design concepts. In brief, low-fidelity wireframing is where all <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">web development company</a> begin work.</p>
<h3>B. Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
<p>Mid-fidelity wireframe web designs are a bit higher in quality. These are interface frameworks without the final branding elements. With mid-fidelity frameworks, the clients get an understanding of how the final design would look like.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13210" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-1024x768.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>With mid-fidelity wireframes, designers can try out different styles of content hierarchy. These frameworks use darker shades to emphasize different types of content. It is the digitized version of low-fidelity wireframes that helps to finalize the framework before the design components are added.</p>
<h3>C. High-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
<p>High-fidelity frameworks include all the suggestions and changes conveyed in the earlier steps. It is one of the most important steps to design a website. And that&#8217;s why high-fidelity frameworks include necessary design &amp; branding elements such as images, fonts, and colors.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13211" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-1024x768.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The type of content on high-fidelity wireframes might vary from filler content to relevant content. However, the font sizes and style of this framework represent the actual IA that’ll be present on the business platform.</p>
<p>The three levels of the wireframe design process must be followed to craft an empowering design. Missing one might cause certain problems for the next stage. So ensure that the partner web design agency follows all the steps before beginning development.</p>

<p class="title"><strong>Expert Speaks</strong>: While you can skip the mid-fidelity stage, we suggest you don’t. It stands as the bridge between low-fidelity and high-fidelity stages and provides you with a better look at how the suggested design would look on screen, reducing reiterations and costs.</p>

<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: justify;">4. How To Make A Wireframe: The Best Practices We Follow</h2>
<p>Considering all its perks, wireframe design happens to be one of the most prioritized parts of our process. The in-house experts use wireframing to begin the discussion with our clients, flesh out design concepts, and finalize the visual layout before beginning development.</p>
<p>However, it is not easy to create wireframes for websites &amp; <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/custom-software-development/">custom software development</a> purposes. And that’s why we follow some of the most important best practices while creating the visual blueprint for your website. So let us talk about those best practices and why we practice them.</p>
<h3>A. Imbibe Clarity</h3>
<p>One of the main purposes of wireframes is to imbibe clarity in the modern web design process. From setting clear expectations to clarifying the visual layout of the interface- we follow this best practice to ensure the impact of wireframing on the entire process.</p>
<p>It is also the time when we try to clear out any and every query both clients and our design team might have. From the design approach embraced by us to the specific visual impact, the clients are looking for all the questions are answered during this stage.</p>
<h3>B. Empower Users With Confidence</h3>
<p>We believe that a good design empowers the users. And that’s why we begin with a familiar and intentional navigational approach from the very beginning of the wireframing method.</p>
<p>By implementing a user flow that is familiar to users, we lower the learning curve. While planning the wireframes of the core pages, such as the home page or contact pages, we frame the content and place buttons on the familiar and easy to spot for enhanced navigation. This way, before the website development process has even finished, we begin to empower the end-users.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>C. Keep It Simple</h3>
<p>Wireframes are the skeleton version of the UI. And that’s why we focus on keeping it simple. Rather than integrating too many details from the beginning, we start with a barebones version.</p>
<p>We begin wireframe design with a complete paper prototype that hashes out the very basic layout. Then we move onto mid-fidelity wireframes that are detailed enough to understand how the basic hierarchy and elements would look like. Unlike the final stage of the high-fi framework, these two steps focus solely on the placement of the visual element, nothing else.</p>
<h3>D. Consider Screen Sizes</h3>
<p>No matter what kind of business platform it is, screen size is something we must pay attention to. Our agile web design process begins with a mobile-first approach. The in-house design team creates wireframes for all supported devices and then considers how the content will scale based on the screen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13212" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-1024x804.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="804" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-1024x804.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-300x235.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-768x603.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-1536x1206.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-2048x1607.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Expert speaks:</strong> Wireframe sizes differ based on the project. For web platforms, you will need an appropriate approach, but for a native mobile app, you’ll have to be specific regarding the OS, and the variations of devices. So sort out the matter of supported devices before beginning.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>E. Think Of Different User Scenarios</h3>
<p>One platform might have multiple user scenarios. Every individual experience the same platform in a different manner. And that’s why we examine all possible user scenarios while thinking about how to create wireframes.</p>
<p>Such user scenarios include but are not limited to- which access points the user entered the page from, what users are looking for based on the demographic details, what device they are using, etc. Examining these user scenarios helps us to craft improved layouts and navigational elements.</p>
<h3>F. Conduct Research</h3>
<p>One of the main best practices we follow is the research-based approach. Outlining a wireframe is not a simple task, and to ensure success, we need to have a clear understanding of the core functionality of the platform, basic features, as well as the users and their pain points.</p>
<p>To get a clear idea about all these, we begin with in-depth research. Covering all the necessary bases, we can integrate the essential elements of knowledge in planning the layout. The result: faster wireframe design &amp; approval process.</p>
<h3>G. Use Annotations For Clear Communications</h3>
<p>The wireframe prototype design is an effective yet challenging process. The major challenge at this stage is the clarity of communication. The lack of relevant branding/visual elements within the wireframe often confuses the clients about the result. And to solve this, we make use of annotations within the framework.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13213 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-1024x768.jpg" alt="explaining the wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The short notes provide important descriptions of the features functionalities, user flow, etc. With eye-catching and numbered notes, we aim to clarify any kind of miscommunication from the beginning.</p>
<h3>H. Increase Wireframe Fidelity Slowly</h3>
<p>The gradual improvements made to the wireframe design help us to focus on one thing at a time. In the low-fi stage, we focus on crafting the basic layout of the platform. The mid-fidelity stage is when we try to fix the content hierarchy issues. And hi-fi stage is when we implement the branding elements to see how the platform will look like.</p>
<p>This step-by-step improvement ensures that the process is focused, and not all over the place. Each stage has its purpose and the incremental enhancements ensure no detail is forgotten.</p>
<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: justify;">5. Common Wireframing Challenges &amp; How We Deal With Them!</h2>
<p>Even this simple process comes with plenty of trials. Here are some of the most common difficulties we meet while creating wireframes and how we deal with those challenges.</p>
<h3>A. The Eternal Debate Of Polished Vs. Rough Sketch</h3>
<p>The first challenge deals with making changes to the web development process.</p>
<p>The well-known laws of UI/UX dictate that we must always present the polished wireframe to the clients. However, experience has taught us something else. We have seen that presenting a too polished wireframe makes the clients more reluctant to suggest changes. Perhaps because they like it the way it is, or maybe because they feel that the design is finalized. In any case, it causes some serious issues in the later stages of design.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13214 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-1024x768.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>With a three-step website wireframe design, we bypass this issue altogether. This way, the clients don&#8217;t feel too pressured to agree to the pixel-perfect framework and suggest changes freely. And we use those feedback and gradually improve upon the wireframe- from paper prototypes, to mid and then hi-fi frameworks.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>B. Which Pages To Wireframe?</h3>
<p>Wireframe UX design may be a necessary element. But at the same time, it is important to determine for which pages we must design the wireframes. We cannot make wireframes for every page on the website. And that’s why we begin by making up wireframes for the most important pages first.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13215 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-1024x768.jpg" alt="priority of wireframes in desigining" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Based on the client&#8217;s needs, we prioritize different pages/screens of the platform and craft wireframes for them first. And then based on the information hierarchy of these pages, we proceed with the rest of the website.</p>
<h3>C. Text Placeholders &amp; The Problems They Pose</h3>
<p>Text placeholders, such as Lorem ipsum are an easy enough solution to understand on-screen text placement. But it is not a long-term solution. In fact, using text placeholders causes more problems in terms of content space and wireframe navigation design.</p>
<p>And that’s why we include relevant text during the wireframing process from the start. This practice assists to grasp how much space a specific text will require and design accordingly.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Skip Wireframes: They Are The Blueprints Of Your Design Dreams</h2>
<p>Wireframes are an essential part of the agile web design process. With this, entrepreneurs, designers, and developers can visualize the product together, determine its various aspects as well as make all the changes it needs in the very beginning.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">There was a time, ages ago, when things were normal. People went to work, and work-from-home was almost unheard of. No one knew such a thing called social distancing existed. In January of 2020, our design team found itself at a crossroads as to what to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In short, we were feeling stuck. Our team had been making major strides in terms of design work, but we felt we needed a little more vision. Something that would fire us up to the Design Hall of Fame. We were aiming for the stars.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After hours of thinking and overthinking (yes, we creatives keep doing that), we decided that a design sprint was the answer. Or was it? That’s what we thought, at least. We had lovely visions for our future. Collaborative creative teams working on a product together. Aah, art!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But as our design head began to plan out various stages of the design sprint process, an impending disaster started to loom in our world.  A strain of the novel Coronavirus had made it to the US, rapidly spreading across different continents.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In a couple of months, we learned that the entire world was going on lockdown. Social distancing and quarantine were strict norms we’d have to abide by. At Unified, as with many other organizations worldwide, the need for remote work was instantly felt. Work from home was now the ‘new normal.’</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So as creatives, what were we supposed to do? Call it quits? That wasn’t an option. How would we brainstorm for hours on whiteboards? Was it possible to carry out remote design sprints? As it’s now clear, it was.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here’s how we did it.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. What Is A Design Sprint?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">But first, a brief introduction for those who are new to the design world.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Made famous by <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">Google Ventures</a>, design sprint activities have been fairly popular in the industry for quite some time now. Basically, a design sprint is a simple framework that helps translate abstract design ideas into testable, real products.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the name suggests, a sprint focuses more on speed and efficiency than perfection. Plus, it’s much more collaborative in nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sounds complicated? We’ll make it easier for you. What you do is put a group of talented designers, developers, and product managers in one room. You tell them to finish the design and only then, come out outside. We’re serious.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The conventional design sprint somewhat resembles a double-diamond structure. Every stage corresponds to each day of the design process.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">These stages are, namely: Mapping, Sketching, Defining, Prototyping, and finally, Testing. Here’s what it looks like:</h3>
<figure id="attachment_13105" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13105" style="width: 2134px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13105 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-01.jpg" alt="Remote Design Sprints" width="2134" height="1663" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-01.jpg 2134w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-01-300x234.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-01-1024x798.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-01-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-01-1536x1197.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-01-2048x1596.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13105" class="wp-caption-text">Source: abstract.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">To sum it up: a design sprint is a five-day process that gives you, the design lead, ample time to answer some of the most pressing questions. What will be your design and branding strategy? How are you going to test your model?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Design sprints are like the “Top 50 Hits” of your business and web design strategy. Whether it’s design thinking, customer psychology, or innovation, you can just bottle all these up in a concise plan for your team to use.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Instead of waiting for your first prototype to launch and figure out if it’s any good, you can use design sprints as your short cut route to launching and prototyping.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you ask us, design sprint planning is a superpower that few have.  It’s a lot like a time-machine: you can just fling yourself into the future and see what your design ultimately looks like. Besides, you can gauge how your customers will feel about it before making errors that are too expensive.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And, and, and, you can also avoid this:</p>
<figure id="attachment_13106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13106" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13106 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/design-sprint-meme.png" alt="Remote Design Sprints meme" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/design-sprint-meme.png 600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/design-sprint-meme-300x300.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/design-sprint-meme-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13106" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://bit.ly/35hZdTC</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Warming Up: Running Remote Design Sprints</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Design sprints are the stuff of legend. We mean, just look at <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-in/">Slack</a>. Or <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>. Or <a href="https://nest.com/">Nest</a>. Pretty much every tech giant in the world has signed up with Google’s design sprints venture or some other <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">web design company</a>. It’s helped them enter untapped markets, gain millions of customers, and ultimately transform marketing as we knew it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So here’s what you need to do before you run your remote design sprint:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Read THAT Remote Design Sprints  Book</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you’re a web designer, you’ve probably heard of Jake Knapp, Google’s former Design Lead. And that book he wrote. The book that changed how we worked in design. It’s called <a href="https://g.co/kgs/xdxjA7">Sprint (How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days)</a>. If you’ve never been part of a design sprint before, you need to read this book. Like, really read it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And please don’t skim read. Read every part of the book. Love it, smell the pages (no, we’re kidding). But it helps if you give it a thorough run through and make notes to yourself. The book includes some excellent design sprint challenges that’ll help you nurture your creativity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before you ready yourself for the big day, it’s imperative that you take a close, hard look at all the activities and refresh your ideas. In most likelihood, you’ll have a lot to balance, so reading the book will help clear the ground.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Devise A Plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Every project that was successfully executed had some great planning to back it. Before you run your design sprint remotely, just fixate on some essential tools, you’ll need. Here are some tools that we suggest you use.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> for design storyboarding, wireframing, and finally, prototyping</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.mural.co/">Mural </a>for chalking out your ideas on a virtual whiteboard</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Slack for all kinds of asynchronous communication and messaging</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Google Meet, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams for real-time video conferencing, communication, and meetings</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Besides these, there are many other options that your team might prefer. Whatever they are, make sure to list them neatly in your calendar or schedule. Also, add meeting codes to any digital space you might use.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Pro Tip: Set the same access code everywhere. You don’t want twenty people calling you up every other second begging for the code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Preparing Your Design Sprint Tools</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Secretly, we kind of thanked COVID-19 for all that work-from-home. No more Post-its, flyers, easel pads, new markers to worry about.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It’s gotten so much easier now with virtual whiteboards like Mural or, if you’re feeling adventurous, artboards in Figma. Besides these, there are several other offerings that you can use as your canvas, such as <a href="https://www.adobe.com/in/products/xd.html">Adobe XD</a>, <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>, or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sure, you’re going to miss the smell of fresh marker ink or stickers clinging to every part of your workspace, but that’s a small price to pay for freedom, really.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Post-COVID, several brands launched remote design sprint kits, but you can keep it simple with the tools you already know.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just make sure you remind them to buy pens and paper in advance. In case they need it for sketching out their design solutions on something tangible.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. A Nice Cozy Workplace for Remote Design Sprints</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This one’s kind of a dream. As designers and creatives, we all want our work desks to look absolutely Instagrammable. Cozy nooks, natural light, planters, and the perfect cup of French-pressed coffee. But no, that’s not going to be the case with remote design sprints.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Virtual whiteboard, schedules, sketches, phew&#8230;all this is going to make it impossible for you to have that super gorgeous work desk. But you can always go back to it once your design sprint’s over. Can’t you?</p>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. Going Into The Battlefield</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Until the COVID pandemic struck, the general consensus was that design sprints are best conducted offline. That’s because these are incredibly energy-consuming processes. It’s highly collaborative in nature, and back when things were normal, the sheer busyness would overwhelm us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">People rushing around, chasing Post-Its, sketching ideas in a frenzy. You get the picture. Trying to shift it online would then mean complete and utter chaos. Well, we don’t think so.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The most significant factor that determines how successful your remote design sprint is time. When it came to offline sprints, time was in abundance. You could take four to five days and work at your pace. Remote design sprints: that’s a whole different world. We suggest two to three days at max.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To give yourself enough time to think, make sure to conduct all your research before running the sprint. If you’re the project lead, ensure everyone does their bit of research. Things like <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/user-experience-design-and-usability/">usability</a>, user experience, and customer challenges should be of prime importance.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Day 1: Mapping and Sketching</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">As Jake Knapp famously said in his book, “The structure allows the team to “boot up” as much information as quickly as possible — while preventing the usual meandering conversations.” The idea of a design sprint in itself is very efficient, and once you get down to work, you can come up with ideas quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Launching your design team into the Mapping phase on the very first day is a great idea. Take a look at all the things that you need to do, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">i. Asking Your Design Experts</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ii. Work To Be Done</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">iii. Grouping Affinities</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">iv. Execution</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By the end of the day, you’re going to have some great ideas, ready to be sketched. Dive into the sketching exercises and make it a truly collaborative team effort. To translate your sketches into reality, you can use an iPad or even Miro’s remote design sprint templates. If you don’t prefer Miro, you can always switch to a <a href="https://design-sprint.com/remote-design-sprint-template/">Google design sprint template</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When it’s finally time to call it a day, you’ll have tons of creative design ideas waiting to be full-fledged product solutions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Day 2: Defining And Deciding</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not every idea is going to make it to the testing phase. Testing and launching are extremely time and money-consuming processes, so you’ll have to fixate on any one.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here’s what we suggest you can do: divide your team into smaller groups and decide on your options. Vote on the ones that seem most promising. Debate and define what you want from your design, and then finally, you can zero in on one.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you have your winning design in hand, you can create a step-by-step storyboard. Sketch out how users are going to interact with your product. Whether it’s <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/website-design/">web design</a> for <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/">mobile apps</a>, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/">UI/UX design</a> for an <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/">eCommerce website</a>, outlining a skeleton will go a long way.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You’re now at the end of your remote design sprint—time to follow up with prototypes and testing.</p>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. The Afterparty in Remote Design Sprints</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">So your remote design sprint’s over. Congrats! You made it! Now go thank your colleagues and teammates for the amazing work they’ve done. Collaboration, as they say, is the key to all great creative work.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13117 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pexels-rfstudio-3810754-1024x731.jpg" alt="Remote Design Sprints afterparty" width="1024" height="731" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pexels-rfstudio-3810754-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pexels-rfstudio-3810754-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pexels-rfstudio-3810754-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pexels-rfstudio-3810754.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But you’re not done with things yet. After the end of your two to three-day remote sprint work, it’s time for some design sprint user testing. Once your design team rushes off to turn the storyboard into reality and a workable prototype, you’ll have to launch user testing sessions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the part where you expose real-world users to your prototypes and see how your design fares. There are chances it could turn out to be a complete failure but keep your fingers crossed.</p>
<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: left;">5. Weaving Magic</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There was a time when if you told someone you were about to run a remote design sprint, they’d have scoffed at you.  Not anymore. Digital sprints are here to stay. They are not just workable, but very useful too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13116 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pexels-startup-stock-photos-212286-1024x682.jpg" alt="Remote Design Sprints magic" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pexels-startup-stock-photos-212286-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pexels-startup-stock-photos-212286-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pexels-startup-stock-photos-212286-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pexels-startup-stock-photos-212286.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If your design sprint turns out to be successful, well, good for you. Whatever the outcome, a little retrospection is going to do you a lot of good.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What was most valuable? Which part of the process did you most like? Is there a different approach you can take? How is the customer experience going to turn out like? These are some questions that you can ask yourself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><i>“Design is the silent ambassador of your brand.” – Paul Rand</i></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The line by one of the most prominent graphic designers in the world is enough to explain why the link between branding and website design is so important to pay attention to when designing the online platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No matter what the organization does or what kind of landscape it caters to, creating a unique identity through design is an effective way of stealing inside people&#8217;s hearts and staying there for a longer time. Sure, you can use a lot of words to create an image. But words are easily forgotten. Visuals are not.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With that in mind, let&#8217;s delve deep into the process of web design branding and the best practices that will enhance the overall effect of branding efforts. But before that, let’s take a peek into all the matters we are going to cover with this article.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. Web Design Branding: What It Is &amp; Why Is This Necessary?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sites are the modern-day spokesperson for businesses. The online platforms are crafted to strengthen an entrepreneur&#8217;s existence on the internet and garner more and more clients. The importance of these platforms is growing, as an increasing number of people are turning to the internet to seek out relevant services they might need daily.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keeping that significance of the website in mind, it is only logical that you start branding the website design of the business platform. With a streamlined process, one can create, implement, and portray the perfect business personality and encourage growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What other reasons make this practice a necessity? Here’s a list with some examples.</p>
<h3>a. Improves Company Recognition</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Think about a popular brand, like Pepsi!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whenever someone says Pepsi, the one thing that we all think of is the iconic blue color of a Pepsi can. The color is an integral part of the brand that is Pepsi, and it is a visual that we all recognize (and maybe even love!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The color is so much a part of Pepsi&#8217;s brand design that the entire site is that same shade of blue. And it is one of the best visual branding practices one can ever find.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But what if the platform did not make use of that color?</p>
<figure id="attachment_13020" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13020" style="width: 1259px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13020 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pepsi-branding.png" alt="" width="1259" height="694" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pepsi-branding.png 1259w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pepsi-branding-300x165.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pepsi-branding-1024x564.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pepsi-branding-768x423.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1259px) 100vw, 1259px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13020" class="wp-caption-text">Source: pepsi.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">As we already mentioned above, audiences tend to forget words, but they remember visuals and how the services made them feel. And with that kind of dynamic in play, it makes sense that brand identity development on a website is one of the surest ways of being remembered by the audience, and therefore improve the company recognition.</p>

<h3>b. Helps With Consistency Of Branding Practice</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Branding is not merely visuals! It’s a lot more than that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Design and branding strategy is all about the organization’s vows, its values, and how it is delivered through all the services. And when the site does not reflect that sentiment, it creates a gap in the branding efforts. And a gap like that is going to make it hard to gain buyer trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the best examples of consistent branding can be seen on the site of Trello. A collaboration tool that is well known for streamlining teamwork through digital Kanban-like boards, Trello’s site design reflects that promise of ease and simplicity well enough.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13021" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13021" style="width: 1263px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13021 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trello-branding.png" alt="" width="1263" height="699" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trello-branding.png 1263w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trello-branding-300x166.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trello-branding-1024x567.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trello-branding-768x425.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1263px) 100vw, 1263px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13021" class="wp-caption-text">Source: trello.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Expanding the corporate brand identity design to the site is going to provide the visitants with a seamless experience that will become the ultimate trademark for the brand. If the site experience doesn’t match up to organization claims, then the branding efforts will be meaningless.</p>

<h3>c. Keep The Employees Inspired</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">When speaking about branding benefits, most people talk about customers. But what about the employees?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good brand design </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the in-house experts of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Casablanca User Experience Agencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that outlines the visions &amp; values of the establishment clearly, gives the staff a bigger purpose to work towards and helps to stay invigorated. Without this bigger plan to serve, the work efforts put in by the workers will be dispassionate at best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Think about a brand like Microsoft- the branding efforts have always been symmetrical with the kind of services the organization provides. And the organization&#8217;s overarching purpose keeps the workers encouraged to do better constantly.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13022" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13022" style="width: 1226px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13022 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-content-branding.png" alt="" width="1226" height="482" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-content-branding.png 1226w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-content-branding-300x118.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-content-branding-1024x403.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-content-branding-768x302.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1226px) 100vw, 1226px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13022" class="wp-caption-text">Source: microsoft.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">And this happens to be one of the many reasons why web design branding is imperative to reach the top of the market. Simply wanting to advance the business will not encourage the workers to perform well. Providing a brand goal through enterprise vision and letting the site design reflect that will be one of the ultimate ways to keep the in-house staff invigorated.</p>
<h3>d. Attracts More Customers</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Acquiring new consumers is a different challenge compared to retaining them. It is a widely known fact that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/09/12/dont-spend-5-times-more-attracting-new-customers-nurture-the-existing-ones/?sh=b98929e5a8e0">it takes five times more effort to gain new consumers than it takes to retain one</a>. And most of this leviathan effort can be executed through the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The difference between retaining and acquiring goes something like this- a person who has already obtained a service, and was provided with a satisfying aid (regardless of the site design/brand positioning) would be more likely to contact the same provider again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But a person unaware of an organization would like to size it up first. This includes complete online research about the organization, testimonials, and a thorough examination of whether the services and brand value match with specific user goals. The visitor will decide once the results come out to be satisfactory.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And to sway user decisions, one has to know how to design a brand and imbibe it within the site. All because the site becomes the first thing the audience encounters, and without expressing the brand image on the site, there is a chance to either mislead or lose the visitors to a competitor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are more reasons why visual identity development is crucial for business sites. But the above mentioned happen to be some of the more prominent ones that drive <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">web design companies</a> to utilize the site to integrate the brand as well. Now let&#8217;s talk about the process our in-house experts at SCS INFO swear by when it comes to creating a brand on site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Related Read: <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/cms-development/"><b>Lead generative CMS website development? We have the ideal process! Don’t you want to know what that process is?</b></a></p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. How To Design A Brand On The Website?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">What does it take to develop a brand?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, even now, this specific practice is considered to be all about visual elements, therefore a lot of online resources talk about the relationship between colors, logo, and brand design, as well as animations and whatnots. But in reality, the matter goes a lot deeper than that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So let&#8217;s take a look at our in-house four-part procedure of branding through the site. This exclusive peek will help to understand how to build a perfect brand image on the site to impress the visitants and establish market authority.</p>
<h3>a. Build Your Story From Ground Up</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The story is a necessary element to start creating a brand on the site. But why is that?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A story involves characters, conflicts, and resolution. And a rich story of the organization’s journey from the very beginning to the present point is significant in touching the heart of the visitants, engaging them, and convincing them that through all the hardships, the enterprise has earned the right kind of experience needed to fulfill specific user demands.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Without a story, the brand identity on the website design is going to be just a glorious pitch to the consumers, full of words that might be true on the enterprise end, but fail to convince even the most easily swayed people out there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, when building the story, there are a few things to keep in mind-</p>
<h3>b. Introduce A Meaningful Narrative</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The consumers won’t be interested in what you do and how you do it unless you don’t start with why you do it!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When acquiring a solution or a product, the user has a set objective. And a misalignment between the user and service provider purposes can cause the business great harm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that&#8217;s why as a seasoned brand design company, we always start the process with a relevant narrative. This story explains to the visitants why the organization provides the specific service and begins the relationship with target clients on a note of mutual understanding.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">

</div>
</div>
<h3>c. Keep The Story Short &amp; Sweet</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">If the brand narrative goes like this below image, then it is time for some heavy editing.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13028" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13028" style="width: 830px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13028 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/clapham-junction-keep-story-short-and-sweet.png" alt="" width="830" height="467" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/clapham-junction-keep-story-short-and-sweet.png 830w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/clapham-junction-keep-story-short-and-sweet-300x169.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/clapham-junction-keep-story-short-and-sweet-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13028" class="wp-caption-text">Source: itv.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">A story that goes on and on with millions of twists and turns is not ideal for web design branding. To engage the audience right from the beginning, the story needs to be succinct. And to do so, the narrative should focus on these specific parts-</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">How the organization started?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The mission statement</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Why is the organization different &amp; better than the competitors?</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keeping the narrative limited to these three main elements will be enough. But a bland exhibition can hurt engagement. And that&#8217;s why skilled brand design companies put so much concentration on making the basic facts engaging.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. Provide Contrast To Stand Out</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stories in this world are not that different from one another. And the best way you can make your brand design story different than the rest out there is by providing contrast.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13035 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-providing-a-contrast-to-narrative-point.jpg" alt="" width="825" height="854" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-providing-a-contrast-to-narrative-point.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-providing-a-contrast-to-narrative-point-290x300.jpg 290w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-providing-a-contrast-to-narrative-point-768x795.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What’s a contrast though?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Contrast is all about what makes your organization different from the others out there. The element that provides a contrast to your brand story can be your unique value proposition, new kind of business planning, or an innovative user experience on the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As long as you express clearly how your service is different and irreplaceable compared to others out there, you can provide the much-needed contrast and establish your corporate brand identity strongly in the market.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. Telling The Story Clearly</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once the story is built one needs to focus on web design branding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content is essential for a proper connection between the website story and the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">audience. And brand design firms utilize the site content to implement the narrative on the site. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Casablanca Digital Agencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acknowledge the pivotal role played by content in the site-narrative roadmap. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But how to ensure that the content is telling the story perfectly?</p>
<h3>a. Craft A Hierarchy That Makes Sense</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">First things first, an information hierarchy is needed to ensure the story structure makes sense.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This detail on the site can differ depending on the type of industry and audience. So before starting the implementation of that ideal story and brand identity development on the site, investigate a bit more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this situation consulting with an experienced web design agency will provide a better insight into the appropriate structure needed to match the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/benefits-of-mental-models-in-ux-design/">mental models of specific users</a>. We also ensure that this information is included within the brand guidelines for the design for future reference.</p>
<h3>b. Determine The Voice Of The Brand</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A story told blandly will do little to hold the attention of the audience. And when it comes to creating a brand for small businesses, experts are careful about the voice and tone used throughout the content.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13036 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-setting-a-tone-and-voice-for-web-content-point.jpg" alt="" width="825" height="528" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-setting-a-tone-and-voice-for-web-content-point.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-setting-a-tone-and-voice-for-web-content-point-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-setting-a-tone-and-voice-for-web-content-point-768x492.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Setting the mood of the narrative is all about how the audience will perceive the brand. Once again, determining the content tone can be tricky, but simple audience research can solve the problem without any hassle.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Expert speaks</strong>: According to our in-house design experts, the perfect content is genuine, focused on the consumers, and simple to understand. As long as the content has these three qualities, it will be a success no matter what kind of tone is used!</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>c. Three Musketeers Of Perfect Content- Original, Short &amp; Engaging</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once the voice is defined, it is time to ensure the content fulfills its designated purposes. And to do so, it is crucial to pay attention to three factors of content design and branding strategy-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Great content is always original. In this age of advanced piracy checks and strict Google ranking rules, no one can get away with copied content on the site. This is why to ensure the integrity of the narrative, we keep the content (both text &amp; images) as original as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Besides the originality, the content needs to be short. We have already discussed how significant it is to keep the brand story short, and that rule applies to the content as well. The impact of too long content will be incredibly harmful to the business as well as the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And lastly, we don&#8217;t just tell a story. With the use of necessary engaging elements such as proper brand architecture design, we ensure that the content delights the visitors and leaves a positive impact so that users keep coming back to the site.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Team SCS INFO helped transform their old website into a brand new business-boosting platform. And while doing that, we made sure that the site content was smart, snappy, and relatable to the target audience.</p>
<h3>d. Update The Content Regularly</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Popular sites content that triumphantly tells the brand narrative, as well as drive business for the organization, are always updated, fresh, and recent. And these updates are made according to changes in business plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consulting with an experienced website design company and updating the content based on the current changes in the company and the target user demands is the surefire way to keep the branding practices consistent on the site. So don’t forget the importance of such a matter and ensure that the content of the site is updated accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. Embellish The Narrative With Visuals</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">We believe that telling an engaging brand narrative is easier with the added visual components.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Be it the images and videos on the platform or the color schemes and logo- all this helps to make the content a lot more entertaining to look at and digest. Remember that the modern audience doesn&#8217;t have a lot of time to read an entire page. And that’s why visual details have become necessary to brand the site and engage the right kind of visitants.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s see how expert web design agencies utilize visual details that will enrich the branding efforts on the site-</p>
<h3>a. Choosing The Right Scheme Of Color</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"> A simple thing such as a color serves a lot of purpose on the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is not a superficial detail. The color scheme is supposed to express the primary thing you want the site users to feel. Depending on various factors, such as cultural, geographical, and different segments of the clients, this essential part of the brand guidelines design will make the users feel different things.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is why when deciding on the color palette for the site, we begin with a complete analysis of the demographic and the kind of visual requirements it has. Based on different factors we choose an arrangement that is visually pleasing as well as fulfills the brand goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Expert speaks</i><i>: According to our in-house designers, color plays a big role in making that first impression on the visitants. And that&#8217;s why choosing the right colors is just as important as any other part of the process. </i><i> </i></p>
<h3>b. Logo: The Branding Necessity</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The relationship between the logo and brand design is undeniably significant. The logo is an essential component that signifies the identity of the organization. The perfect logo grabs the audience’s attention within moments, as well as expresses market authority.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13034 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-the-logo-point.jpg" alt="" width="825" height="528" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-the-logo-point.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-the-logo-point-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-the-logo-point-768x492.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So how does one create a perfect logo?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are plenty of ways to create a logo. The abundance of logo making tools out there makes it easy to create logos for the business. However, for better and more customized logos, hiring an expert brand design firm will be the best option.</p>

</div>
<h3>c. Express The Story Better With Images &amp; Videos</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Visitors today don&#8217;t have the time to read through the entire website. And that&#8217;s why using too much text will be an irrelevant practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But how to design a brand image without a lot of content?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, the best way to ensure that the brand narrative is expressed perfectly without having to include long content is through the proper implementation of multimedia content. The easy to consume images and videos will make the site experience more enjoyable, as well as communicate the brand value to the audience.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13033" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13033" style="width: 1226px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13033 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unified-infotech.jpg" alt="" width="1226" height="514" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unified-infotech.jpg 1226w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unified-infotech-300x126.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unified-infotech-1024x429.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unified-infotech-768x322.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1226px) 100vw, 1226px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13033" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, there are some rules for adding images and videos on the screen that our experts always adhere to, and we are going to share it with you-</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>
<h4>Don’t Add The Image Above The Fold</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">The fold is the screen real estate that is noticeable without scrolling. It is the first thing the visitant will see when they land on the site, and that&#8217;s why we ensure that no big images are blocking the precious area and taking away that chance at making that stellar first impression.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Pro Tip: Still want to have an image above the fold? We suggest using a hero image. With this, you can add a background hero image that will help to set the atmosphere of the website.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>
<h4>Compress The Visual Content</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Images and videos are notorious for slowing down sites. And that&#8217;s why we always compress all multimedia content on the sites so that the site experience stays fast and smooth.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. Delight The Audience With  Micro-Interactions</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The purpose of the site is not only to inform the visitors but engage and entertain them. And when it comes to delighting the users, there’s no match to micro-interactions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These small trigger-based details can have a very positive impact on the site experience. Web design and branding services use these components to elevate the mundane site experience and make it entertaining; whether it is a screen loading simulations or a simple mouse hover animatronics, the small details can enhance the entire experience and make your brand stand out more.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Micro-interactions are cool, but don’t overdo them! Adding too many of such small animations can take away the novelty factor, rendering the whole thing quite useless.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: left;">5. Improve The Brand Impact With UI/UX</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lastly, we have arrived at the UI/UX factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In recent times we have all been aware of how important UI/UX aspects are to drive site engagement up. The proper implementation of UI/UX can also be elemental to boost business growth and increase leads through the site. But its effect on web design branding is too significant to ignore.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No one can completely control how a site visitor feels about the brand, but with the right kind of UI/UX implementation, it is possible to positively influence their thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some touchstones of UI/UX design our in-house experts think are mandatory to ensure the impact of the site on the users is a positive one-</p>
<h3>a. For A Seamless Experience Go Responsive</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Modern audiences are using different kinds of devices to access the site and conduct research. And that is why it is important to keep the matter of responsiveness in mind when designing the UI.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that the web design agency you’ve hired for design and branding purposes is experienced in creating responsive sites. With a responsive approach, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Casablanca Website Design Agencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it will be easy to provide a wholesome experience to the users who can enjoy the site whenever, wherever.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>b. Let The Site UI/UX Reflect Brand Values</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The site UI/UX is the perfect way of ensuring that the brand value is embedded into the customer experience. And that&#8217;s why we implement elements that reflect the specific values and mission of the client brand and let the consistent UI/UX express the brand value to the visitors.</p>
<h3>c. Keep Interactions Simple &amp; Transparent</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">While crafting the brand architecture design, you also need to focus on keeping the navigation simple and easy to understand. Too complicated navigational design on the site will discourage users from further exploration and all the branding efforts will go to waste.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And there it is, the complete four-step way of building a brand through site design. It is a cohesive and all-encompassing process that covers the entirety of the brand storytelling and enhances all the efforts of building a brand through the site design.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">With A Branded Website, Business Success Is Only A Few Steps Away</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Web design branding is not just about the visual elements rather it is about telling a story in the most visual way possible. And to accomplish that successfully, the right design and branding strategy is necessary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials are probably the most talked-about generation today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it is their entitled behavior or how</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/16/millionaire-millennials-avocado-property-coffee.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their obsession with “Avocados” is keeping them from buying a house</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; baby boomers and Gen x-ers have a lot to say about them. But no matter how controversial the generation gets, not considering millennials and their demands when designing a business website is going to be business suicide.<br />
</span><br />
<iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/jSxK33dwEMbkY" width="480" height="299" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, before we get into the nitty-gritty of millennial demands and how you are going to fulfill them through web design strategy, let’s look at who millennials really are and why you should be paying attention to them. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elusive Millennials: Why Are They?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make your website Millennials friendly, you have to first find out who millennials are. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12034 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/three-persons-sitting-on-the-stairs-talking-with-each-other-1438072.jpg" alt="three persons sitting on the stairs talking with each other" width="1280" height="854" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/three-persons-sitting-on-the-stairs-talking-with-each-other-1438072.jpg 1280w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/three-persons-sitting-on-the-stairs-talking-with-each-other-1438072-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/three-persons-sitting-on-the-stairs-talking-with-each-other-1438072-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/three-persons-sitting-on-the-stairs-talking-with-each-other-1438072-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, according to the </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report of the Pew research center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most millennials were born between 1981 to 1996, but the people born between 1980 to 2000 are considered to be millennials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What defines this generation is the fact that they have seen the rapid transformation in the technological scenario of the world. Whether we are talking about CRT television to Flat screen LED television, or shopping from small family-owned shops to departmental stores to online shopping, the millennials have seen it all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why it is not exactly easy to trick the millennials. The rapid digital transformation has made them quite aware of what works and what doesn’t, as well as what they exactly need. You need to be paying enough attention to the generation if you want your business to succeed. Want detailed reasons? Follow on to the next point. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why You Should Be Paying Attention To Them?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes the millennial generation so important for your web design efforts?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and foremost reason is the fact that right now, Millennials are entering the prime of their age. People from ages 18 to 34 are dominating the market and changing it with spending habits that are different than the generations that came before them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are three reasons why you should be paying more attention to millennials in your web designing and branding efforts. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now </span>millennials make up three-quarters of the entire US population at 83.1 million people<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.lexingtonlaw.com/blog/credit-cards/millennial-spending-habits.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the average millennial expenditure per year is $47,112. In the US every year millennials altogether are spending $600 billion. </span></li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_12019" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12019" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/credit-card-debt-stats-3-768x390.jpg" alt="web design for millennials" width="768" height="390" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/credit-card-debt-stats-3-768x390.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/credit-card-debt-stats-3-768x390-300x152.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12019" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Lexingtonlaw.com</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials are not impressed by advertisements anymore. According to statistics, </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-to-millennials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84% of millennials do not trust traditional advertising campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by various brands and companies. When it comes to purchasing any products or services, they turn to their family and friends, and online reviews to get suggestions and judge the value of the product. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new thinking and purchasing habits of the millennials have changed the market scenario entirely. And that’s why following the traditional branding and web designing practices is not going to work anymore. Additionally, while looking for expert assistance, millennials do not religiously seek out </span><b>Top Casablanca WordPress Development Agencies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are also on the lookout for companies that leave their signature style and create unique, effective, and yet client-appealing website designs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to first determine the millennial demands when it comes to a product/service website’s design and functionality and then optimize the design accordingly. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting Millennial Demands With Web Design</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we know why millennials are important to the overall success of your business, we can come down to the core topic of this entire article- designing a website for millennials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different from their previous generation, millennials are quite picky when it comes to choosing a product. As the information age generation, they have spent their formative years cruising through the nooks and crannies of the online world. Which kind of makes them experts in all things online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your website is going to be your business representative online. And if you want to appeal to this tech-savvy/online-expert generation, you have to follow their rules and <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">design a website</a> that matches their standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are their demands from a website exactly? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you design a website that’ll match their expectations? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at millennial demands and how you need to design your websites according to that. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Responsive Web Design Strategies: A Must-have</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/09/us-generations-technology-use/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">93% of millennials between the ages of 23 to 38 own a smartphone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and use it every day to perform various kinds of tasks, such as shopping online, browsing social media and conducting research before buying something. So it is kind of obvious that millennial users are looking for a mobile-friendly experience any kind of website they visit. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12020" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12020" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12020 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/london_rag_large_03.jpg" alt="web design for millennials" width="1600" height="1200" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/london_rag_large_03.jpg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/london_rag_large_03-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/london_rag_large_03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/london_rag_large_03-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12020" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://dribbble.com/shots/5336682-Ecommerce-Website-Design/attachments/1157439</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the fact that Google is now rewarding mobile-friendly websites with a better ranking, the millennial demand should also be another reason for you to make your website mobile-friendly. Until the 3rd quarter of 2019, </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile website traffic amounted up to 51.51%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is more than half of the web traffic globally. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12021" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12021" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12021 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/web-traffic-from-mobile.png" alt="web design for millennials" width="512" height="334" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/web-traffic-from-mobile.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/web-traffic-from-mobile-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12021" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you want your website to appeal to the millennial crowd, design your website with responsive web design strategies. Not only is it going to please the millennial users, but it also gets you better ranking on SERPs. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Self-service Option For “Do-It-Yourselvers”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials are known for being the “in-control” generation, whether it is a simple DIY task or a website related query. Contacting customer service is the last thing on their mind when faced with some kind of problem, and they absolutely loathe being put on hold when finally calling customer service. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12022" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12022" style="width: 1341px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12022 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/faq-integrated.png" alt="web design for millennials" width="1341" height="637" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/faq-integrated.png 1341w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/faq-integrated-300x143.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/faq-integrated-768x365.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/faq-integrated-1024x486.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1341px) 100vw, 1341px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12022" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/faq-integrated-podiatry-clinic</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To please this ‘‘in-control” generation, you need to integrate your website with self-service features. Resources such as detailed FAQs, discussion forums for sharing various problems and their solutions, as well as blogs and articles for self-help tutorials, can help you to make your website a self-servicing one. This way your website will be more in tune with the millennial DIY attitude. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Social Media Contact = Getting Popular</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials saw the emergence of social media, and they are still riding that wave till now. From Orkut, and Myspace of the bygone era to today’s Instagram and Snapchat, millennials have seen it all. For them, social media platforms are the perfect way to connect with both people and brands, discover things that help them to enhance the quality of life. They are also more vocal on social media, expressing their views on various matters.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12024" style="width: 1347px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12024 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unified-infotech-footer.png" alt="SCS INFO footer" width="1347" height="637" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unified-infotech-footer.png 1347w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unified-infotech-footer-300x142.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unified-infotech-footer-768x363.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unified-infotech-footer-1024x484.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12024" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you want to become popular among millennials, you have to integrate a way for them to connect with you on social media when designing the website. Being able to connect with you from their social media accounts will not only increase your popularity but also better your chances of getting discovered by more potential users. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Rewards In Exchange For Loyalty</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the </span><a href="https://retailwire.com/discussion/millennials-brand-loyalty-comes-into-question/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how millennials are not at all the “brand-loyal” generation, like their predecessors, many brands and products have gained their loyalty. The challenge is not about gaining the millennial loyalty and approval, it is about how you are going to get that. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12023" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12023" style="width: 1348px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12023 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starbucks-reward.png" alt="web design for millennials" width="1348" height="579" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starbucks-reward.png 1348w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starbucks-reward-300x129.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starbucks-reward-768x330.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starbucks-reward-1024x440.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12023" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.starbucks.com/rewards/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional loyalty programs such as “100th customer of the day” or stacking up loyalty points by spending more on a product doesn’t work on millennials anymore. In order to gain millennial loyalty, you need to integrate unique and new kinds of incentive programs that bring value to them. Whether it is paid subscription for premium features, or various offers, benefits, and discounts with added value, incentive programs that actually care about the user needs is important to gain the loyalty of the millennial clients. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Connect Better With Storytelling</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials want to engage with a product or service they feel connected with. And not just the millennial customer, but almost every generation today want to feel connected with the product, and the best way for you to do that is through integrating storytelling techniques in your website design. </span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/KFVJos0sLohNGJZ5zL" width="480" height="221" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might seem like just another buzzword, but the power of storytelling to build the trust of the user is undeniable. Take the above example. </span><a href="https://bellroy.com/explore/slim-your-wallet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bellroy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a popular company making all sorts of handbags and wallets. On their homepage, through the story like a comparison of two wallets, they clearly convey what they do and what their product is all about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are doing it by integrating meaningful images on the website, or through texts and articles, ensure that your website does not just display a bunch of relevant texts and images to the user, rather actually speaks to them about shared experience, interests and values. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Break The Design Stereotypes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s another thing the millennials are famous for, it is breaking stereotypes. They are the generation that started to break the glass ceiling, and they would appreciate it if your website’s design does the same. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12025" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12025" style="width: 1349px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12025 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/break-the-streotype.png" alt="break the streotype in your web design" width="1349" height="630" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/break-the-streotype.png 1349w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/break-the-streotype-300x140.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/break-the-streotype-768x359.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/break-the-streotype-1024x478.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1349px) 100vw, 1349px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12025" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Globalxplorer.org</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website for </span><a href="https://www.globalxplorer.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Xplorer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the perfect example of breaking design stereotypes. Unlike most websites like this, Global Explorers use a block-like design to p[artually display the people of different cultures. This way they convey the powerful message of how till now we have only taken a brief peek at what these people and cultures represented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So before you think of a design interface, take a good look at your competitors in the same industry, and note down the similar elements on their websites, elements that seem cliche and stereotypical to your industry. And while designing make sure that you don’t include those elements on your website. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Combine Aesthetic With Functionality</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When designing your website, you will be tempted to make it look pretty, despite the lack of functionalism. And of course, a website that’s aesthetically pleasing is always popular with the crowd. But not when it comes to the Millennials. </span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/YppqrONEaOdPBO13xz" width="480" height="210" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website for Woven magazine has integrated both the aesthetic transitions of images and functionality of the navigation. Millennials are fond of functionalism that comes in an aesthetically pleasing package. Which is why you have to design a website that comes with both functionality and looks good. Every element that you use on the website should have a part in enhancing the user experience. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Speed Up The Experience</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not just a millennial specific matter, but yes it is important. Everyone loves a site that’s fast loading and does not drag on the experience. Users today especially millennials have a short span of attention, which can be diverted from your website if it doesn’t load within 3 seconds or less.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/11ASZtb7vdJagM" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how are you going to make your website performance fast and snappy? There are plenty of ways, such as using compressed images and videos, caching, and removing the unnecessary line breaks and spaces from JavaScript and CSS codes. Find out the best way for you to speed up the website, cause millennials absolutely hate anything slow, especially a website. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Don’t Go To The UI/UX Dark Side</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not aware, then you should know that UI/UX dark pattern is shady website design practices that make the site user interact with a website in ways they didn’t want to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With dark patterns, it’s extremely easy to get site visitors to click on a CTA, get their mail address as well as the payment address. But when it comes to millennials, using UI/UX dark patterns is going to be like killing your website with your own hands. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12026" style="width: 1345px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12026 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bad-UX.png" alt="bad UX" width="1345" height="635" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bad-UX.png 1345w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bad-UX-300x142.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bad-UX-768x363.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bad-UX-1024x483.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1345px) 100vw, 1345px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12026" class="wp-caption-text">Source: dafont.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advertisement of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dafont</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website displays advertisements that look like a part of the original website until you spot the tiny cross sign. Practicing this kind of dark UI/UX design patterns is going to make your website blacklisted for almost all millennial users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is already extremely hard to gain the trust of the millennial crowd since they are already a well-researched generation who take everything with a pinch of salt. So if you are targeting a millennial audience, then forego of the shady navigational queues and multiple confusing CTAs. whether you are working with a </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">web development company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or have an in-house designing team, make sure that the website is designed with a transparent policy, and without any shady UI/UX patterns. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Stand Up For Something</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials didn&#8217;t just grow up in a rapidly changing technological landscape, but also during a rapidly changing socio-political-economic scenario. This has made them more outspoken and passionate about various social causes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the study conducted by Harris Interactive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Millennials are more prone to take a company’s stand of various social issues into consideration before even interacting with them. </span><a href="https://www.conecomm.com/news-blog/new-cone-communications-research-confirms-millennials-as-americas-most-ardent-csr-supporters"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of millennials would not mind making a personal sacrifice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as paying more for a product if the company happens to support a social cause they are passionate about. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12027" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12027 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stand-up-for-something.png" alt="stand up for something" width="512" height="242" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stand-up-for-something.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stand-up-for-something-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12027" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.jnj.com/caring</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why getting the millennials to interact with your website, you have to show them that you are not only passionate about social issues but also trying to make an impact with your website. When designing the website, define your product and how it is making a positive impact on the social landscape of the world. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">11. Keep It (the Content) Light And Breezy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the many complaints against the millennial generation is the fact that they are informal. They would rather wear the casual outfit to work every day and call everyone by their first names rather than Mr. This or Miss. that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, infuriating this millennial tendency is for many out there, it is only because millennials want to shed the excess of action and get to the core of the matter as soon as possible. They want to get up close and personal with issues they are dealing with and don’t like to waste time with formalities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why when designing your website content for millennials, you need to be more direct. Don’t use a lot of formalities and beat around the bush. Keep it light, interesting and fresh (authentic). </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12028" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12028" style="width: 1350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/keep-website-light-and-breezy.png" alt="keep website light and breezy" width="1350" height="630" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/keep-website-light-and-breezy.png 1350w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/keep-website-light-and-breezy-300x140.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/keep-website-light-and-breezy-768x358.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/keep-website-light-and-breezy-1024x478.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12028" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.canva.com/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canva keeps its content light and informal from the sign-in page. The tone of their content from the beginning is light and informal, creating a sense of acquaintance from the beginning. Another benefit of keeping the content simple is that it becomes easily scannable, helping to capture the attention of the users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And last but not the least, don’t “tell” them what they should be deriving from the content. Present all the authentic data and content to them, and gently guide them towards the conclusion you want them to achieve, rather than telling them. It’ll go a long way to earn their trust for your business.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping It Up!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far millennials have proven to be the elusive generation, hard to understand yet with simple demands, working smartly, yet thought of as lazy and overly dependent on technology. No matter where you stand on the whole millennials generation debate, you can not ignore the fact that they are the most important people to reach out to if you want your business to be a success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing a website based on the millennial need is going to make sure that you create a lifelong relationship with them. Even though it is going to be hard to earn the millennial trust, once you earn it, it’ll never lose trust. To optimize your web design strategy, and include the millennials in the loop. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“What is the average cost to build a website?”</p>
<p>It is the first question that comes to anyone’s mind who wants to build a website for their business. And right now, in this pandemic scenario, almost every business is looking to build a business site.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has changed the way the world functions, and that’s why in future web development is going to become even more important than ever. In such a situation, it is important to know how much you’ll exactly need to build that perfect business website.</p>
<p>As an experienced web development and design company, we can assure you that there is no set price tag for website development. However, we can tell you all about how the development cost might fluctuate and what factors affect it. So let’s talk about how the cost to build and maintain a website is affected by various elements of the development process.</p>
<h2>So How Much Does it Cost to Make a Website?</h2>
<p>We’ll try to breakdown the cost of website development in the following step by step process:</p>
<p>Today, more or less every business is setting up its own web platforms. No wonder why website development services are in huge demand today.</p>
<p>From custom website cost to small business web development cost – we will cover everything in this blog.</p>
<p>Let’s get cracking!</p>
<h2 id="Factors_that_will_determine_the_cost_of_your_website">1. Factors That’ll Determine The Cost Of Your Website</h2>
<p>It has already been mentioned that the final cost of a website can be very different from the initial cost estimation. It is due to the various influencing factors in web development cost breakdown. The development approach also plays an important role in the cost of building an advanced website.<a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/about/contact/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12784" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10-1024x745.jpg" alt="start growing your business" width="1024" height="745" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10-1536x1117.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>We have to tell you before we begin, that the development cost for each website depends on their individual features and goals. These features and goals are influenced by too many factors, changing the entire website creation cost. This is why a small business web design cost and development cost will never be the same as an advanced website development cost.</p>
<p>Below we’ve made a list of all the factors you need to consider while creating a budget for website creation.</p>
<h3>a. Type and Purpose</h3>
<p>To answer the question “how much does it cost to make a website?”, you have to know what is the purpose of your website. Right now you’ll find that there are eight different types of website trending in the market.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Personal website and blog</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Catalog</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Educative</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Brochure (Landing page)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Community building website (Forums, Social Sharing)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Web portal</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to get back to the topic of average website costs by type in detail later in this blog.</p>
<h3>b. Domain and Hosting</h3>
<p>A website needs a domain and hosting service, and that is a given. This important part of your website is also another factor that’s going to affect the price of development for your website.</p>
<h3>c. Basic Tech Stack</h3>
<p>The websites are built and designed using codes and frameworks. When it comes to the basic technical stacks, you’ll have many options to choose from, and these choices are going to determine the cost of development for your website.</p>
<h3>d. Components</h3>
<p>If you want to spice up your basic website, then you’re gonna need some additional plugins and third-party tools. Depending on how many additional components you are using, the price of web development for your business is going to vary.</p>
<h3>e. Setup/Design/Development</h3>
<p>Getting all the components is not enough, you have to assemble them into a website as well. For this, you’ll have three options.</p>
<p>Firstly, you can do it all yourself, but you will need to have an in-depth knowledge of website development. Secondly, you can hire a freelancer, who will help you to develop a website for a more affordable price. And thirdly, you can hire a web development agency that will not only develop and design the website but also help you to maintain it. The choice is yours, but remember, your choice is going to have a serious effect on the budget.</p>
<h3>f. Maintenance</h3>
<p>To make sure that your website is running flawlessly, you have to maintain it on a regular basis. This means that you have to include the website maintenance cost as a part of the total cost of making a website.</p>
<p>So we talked about the major factors that’ll influence the web development cost for you. Now let’s get onto the next point that is different types of websites and their development costs.</p>
<h2 id="What’s_the_type_of_your_website">2. Figure Out The Type Of Website</h2>
<p>As already discussed above, a website can be of many types with different purposes. Now, let’s take a look at the cost of building a website by different types.</p>
<p>When it comes to developing a website, there are five basic types-</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic</li>
<li>Template</li>
<li>Custom websites</li>
<li>E-commerce</li>
<li>Web application</li>
</ul>
<p>The different types of websites are going to cost differently, but how much? Let’s have a look</p>
<h3>a. Creating A Basic Business Website</h3>
<p>In general, such websites are informational. Usually, such websites are built to promote your brand. Also, these help to increase the brand’s loyalty to your business’s target audience. Depending on the complexity, a business website cost can vary.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10077" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10077" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10077 " src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Business-website-example-by-Unfiied-Infotech.jpg" alt="business website development costs" width="660" height="495" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10077" class="wp-caption-text">Business Website created by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p>So if you are thinking about building a basic business website, then you’ll need the following basic pages. Remember that the number of pages your website is going to have will determine the cost of creating a website.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">About the company</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Services offered by the company and portfolio</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Contact page</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Press / Blog page</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Testimonials of the clients</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The other frequently asked features for business websites are</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Integration with ready-made live chats like Freshchat, Intercom, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile-ready design</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">SSL certificate</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Admin panel</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">On-site search opportunity</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Contact back form</li>
</ul>
<p>The above list, however, is for a small business website. When it comes to big enterprises, the above list doesn’t apply because they usually prefer to build customized websites.</p>
<h3>b. Template-based Website Development Cost</h3>
<p>Sometimes your website needs are not going to be fulfilled by a basic website, but that doesn’t mean you need a completely custom built website either. And in these instances, you need template-based websites.</p>
<p>This type of website development is for small and medium websites that can’t spend a lot of money on customized websites for their business. It is easy and quick, with only a few modifications to be done with the template.</p>
<p>There are many website development services in the market that provide template-based web development. WordPress, Wix are some of the examples of these web service providers.</p>
<p>The price of building template-based websites are not much, and usually, they work out really well. So if you are an owner of a small or medium business then make sure to consider the template-based websites for your business.</p>
<p>Template-based websites are a little more sophisticated than the basic ones. However, remember that template-based websites are not the permanent web solution for any business.</p>
<h3>c. Customized Business Web Development</h3>
<p>For bigger businesses, customized websites are the key to success. It’s mostly because bigger enterprises can invest more at the website development process, and not mention, they want their website to stand out and engaging to the users.</p>
<p>The custom-built websites have a sophisticated backend infrastructure. And that’s why the custom website development timeline can last from a couple of months to a few years depending on the complexity of the website.</p>
<p>Before you jump to the decision of creating a custom website for your service, remember that not all businesses need custom website development and the fact that you will have to pay more for a custom website than you will pay for a basic or template-based website.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10078" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10078" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10078 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/customzied-business-website-development-by-Unified-Infotech.jpg" alt="how much does it cost to make a website for customized website" width="800" height="600" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10078" class="wp-caption-text">Customized business website development by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p>Below we have provided a simple list of all the features that should be included in a custom website development.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Business analysis</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Project management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">UI/UX design</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Web development (frontend, backend, admin panel)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Quality Assurance</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Ongoing Support and Maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though it is a costly decision compared to basic and template-based website development, it is still a better decision to go with custom website development. The benefits of a customized website are mentioned below-</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Easier support and maintenance</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Scalability</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Easier to add and customize features</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Easier bug fixing</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Zero load time issue</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">No need to rely on templates or other services</li>

<h3>e. Creating A Single Page Web Application</h3>
<p>This is a single-page website. Also, it can be a separate page that exists on a multipage website. Usually, the main purpose of this page is to sell or promote something – be it a service or a product.</p>
<p>Web applications are very popular due to its accessibility. Users can pretty much use any device to access these single-page applications. However, remember that these websites are not supposed to be overloaded with content.</p>
<p>Developing a web application is a lot less than building custom websites. If you are specifically targeting smartphone users with your website, then this will be a smart choice.</p>
<p>As for the tech stack, many web developers prefer to use Bootstrap and pure HTML to create this type of website. Depending on the level of animation complexity use, both time and the overall web development pricing can vary here.</p>
<h2 id="The_Cost_To_Build_A_Website_As_Per_Goals">3. Cost To Build A Website Also Depends on Your Business Goals!</h2>
<p>Why are you building a website?</p>
<p>If your answer is the generic version of “to succeed in my field of business”, then you need to think deeper.</p>
<p>Having a set of goals for your website is going to make it a lot easier for you to determine what kind of website you might need, and also determine the cost of development.</p>
<p>Now, the individual goals of every website can be different. What you aim to achieve with your website can be different than what Amazon might want to achieve with their website. You have to be careful when selecting your website goals. Below we have mentioned a few website goals and how they might affect your website development cost. But remember, the goals of your website needs to be specific to your own website.</p>
<h3>a. Increase Your Sales</h3>
<p>As an eCommerce website or a website that is selling some kind of service, your main goal should be to increase sales.</p>
<p>When it comes to increasing your website, you have to make sure that the content you put on the page is optimized to rank in the search engine result page, and this needs to be done right at the development stage. This is why you need to hire developers who are well versed in  SEO, or you will have to hire a separate SEO expert, which will eventually drive up the cost of development.</p>
<h3>b. Become An Authoritative Source Of Information</h3>
<p>In case your website is news of blogging website, and you want to become an authoritative source of information on the net, you have to make sure that the content on your website is well optimized from the beginning.</p>
<p>Always make sure to upload content with accurate information. Flawless and original, are the two main features of successful content. Along with that, you will also need a custom content management system.</p>
<p>The online CMS service providers can feel really limited, not to mention, your website content can be in danger from malicious attacks.  So if you want your website to become a reliable source of information, make sure to develop a website that is centered around the content.</p>
<h3>c. Improve Interaction With Clients (Existing &amp; Prospective)</h3>
<p>No matter what your website is for, the end goal of it is to reach people. Both existing and prospective clients need to be impressed with your website. But that doesn’t mean an amazing design along with extra but unnecessary features.</p>
<p>To communicate well with the clients through the website design, you have to build a website that not only has an amazing and usable design but is also robust in the technical aspects.</p>
<p>Choose your frameworks and programming language wisely, and hire experts who are well versed in your choice of tech stack. Any kind of technical fault in the website development process is going to hinder the user experience.</p>
<p>The design, on the other hand, needs to communicate with the client your visions and messages accurately. Choosing the right design elements for your website is not just a matter of aesthetics, but conveying your message to them. And it goes without saying that designing the right website is going to seriously affect your website development cost.</p>
<h3>d. Create Your Own Brand</h3>
<p>Whether you are a small business, or a big enterprise, creating a brand is going to be one of the most important goals if you want loyal clients.</p>
<p>And building a brand through the website is pretty simple if you know what kind of audience you want to reach out to.</p>
<p>Knowing the target audience will help you to optimize your website design. To build a brand, you need to know your audience, and knowing your audience will enable you to optimize your website design accordingly.</p>
<p>Building a brand is also about providing clients with the best user experience. And this can only be possible when you invest enough in the site architecture and UX/UX design. Remember that building a website to complete your website goal might be expensive, but at the end of the day, it will pay you back with enough ROI.</p>
<h2>4. The Design Perspective to Determine the Cost Your Website Development (Most Crucial Part)</h2>

<p>So keeping that in mind, you have to know a few things before getting to the question of how much to design a website. What are those parts you ask? Well, let’s take a look.</p>
<h3>a. You Can’t Sacrifice On Design</h3>
<p>For a new business, affordability in web design is often the more attractive part of the process than the actual design. And it is understandable, but also part of the problem why new businesses have problems getting their website off the ground and function well to bring in more business.

<h3>b. Going Responsive Is Worth The Expense</h3>
<p>The use of mobile is increasing when it comes to accessing the web. And in such a scenario, if you are not investing in a responsive design, you are digging the grave for your own business.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/user-experience-matters-marketing/">research</a>, 74% of users would come back to a site if the site experience was mobile-friendly. The positive mobile experience makes for a positive opinion about the business, and 67% of users have said they would be much more likely to buy a company&#8217;s product if the site is mobile friendly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/company/unified-infotech"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12785 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/13-1024x745.jpg" alt="check out our expertise" width="1024" height="745" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/13-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/13-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/13-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/13-1536x1117.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/13.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>All these numbers only show how many users out there are craving for mobile websites. And they don’t just want a mobile website, they want a well designed mobile website. And that’s why <a href="https://visual.ly/community/Infographics/technology/why-responsive-design-important-10-key-statistics">85% of adult users</a> think that the mobile website needs to be as good or even better than the desktop website. So if you are afraid about investing in responsive web design and thinking that it will increase the average cost of website design, then just take a look at the market demand. And this is one investment that is going to pay you back more than what you spent.</p>
<h3>c. Finding The Right Partner With The Right Process Can Make All The Difference</h3>
<p>Now you must be thinking, “oh god, I have to invest in a good web design that also needs to be responsive and it is going to increase the average cost to build a website!” but let us tell you the value of finding the right design partner, with the right process.</p>
<p>Design, just like development, is a process on its own. There are steps to it that need to be followed before you can finalize the design. Now if you are thinking you can hire a freelancer and be done with it, then you are not exactly right. The value of a curated design process created based on decades of experience is no match for freelancer affordability. And to give you an example of how a curated design process goes, we are going to show you how we design a website</p>
<h3>d. Creating The Perfect Strategy</h3>
<p>Our design process is not based on simple assumptions, but a rock-solid strategy that is formed after thorough research and discussions with clients and stakeholders. This strategy serves as the bedrock for the entire design process. It includes all of business goals and requirements, the target audience and their needs, and how we are going fulfill them with design</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining User Persona</li>
</ul>
<p>The user persona is the fictional representation of the target audience. This bio aids in figuring out who the target users are, and all necessary information such as jobs, location as well as the tasks users might be trying to accomplish with the site. Through this practice, we try to gain insight into user pain points and what kind of solutions are necessary to integrate.</p>
<h3>e. Empathy Mapping For Deeper Understanding</h3>
<p>We believe that the perfect design needs a deeper knowledge of the user’s mind. And that’s why this step in the design operation helps to gain detailed insight into what the users are saying, thinking, and feeling about the site. This insight is going to help in creating a site.</p>
<h3>f. Creating Information Architecture Through Card Sorting</h3>
<p>Design is not just about the colors and images, it is about providing information to the users in the best possible way. And that’s why structuring the information in the right way holds a special place in the process. We apply tests like card sorting to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/benefits-of-mental-models-in-ux-design/">understand the intuitive model</a> and design the information structure the way users want. This way we are able to integrate intuitiveness to the design.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wireframing</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we have all the necessary information and structure in place, it’s time to get cracking on the design. Our wireframing process is designed specifically to keep up with the common purpose of the website we are designing and ensures that there’s no mistake in arranging the elements to their best effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalizing The Design</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, comes the moment of truth, or as we like to call it, finalizing the design. This is the step where we consult our clients and get their feedback on the design. Once we have made changes to the design and got the design approved by them, it is time to move on to development.</p>
<p>The design process is incredibly important to determine how much does it cost to design a website. And with a design partner who has the perfect streamlined design process, can help you to bring down the design cost.</p>
<h2>5. The Development: How It Affects The Cost Of Website Building?</h2>
<p>While the design is all about the external visuals, development is all about the internal functions. To create a robust website, you can not skip over on having a strong development process. However, the development of the site is going to affect website development costs as well. So let’s check out what an ideal web development process includes.</p>
<h3>a. Frontend Development</h3>
<p>The frontend of the website is the part your site visitors are going to see. The frontend of the website is the part they are going to interact with.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10085" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/customized-website-development-process-and-cost.jpg" alt="customized website development costs" width="635" height="534" /></p>
<p>For the frontend development, you have to consider two concerning factors- one is the complexity of the animations and the second is the responsiveness of the website. These two factors have the power to change the website building cost.</p>
<p>Below we have shared most preferred tech stack by developers all around the world  –</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">CSS3,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">HTML5 (Markup languages),</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">TypeScript,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript (Programming languages),</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Angular, Vue, React, etc. (JavaScript frameworks)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">According to our industry-experienced development team, for impressive frontend development, the minimum required time can vary between 250-255 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>But you can’t figure out “how much does it cost to hire a website developer” just by front end development. For a complete idea, you need to check out the backend development process as well.</p>
<h3>b. Backend Development</h3>
<p>The backend, also known as the server-side of the website is like the heart of the website. This is where the main features of the website are going to operate and the development cost for backend is going to take a large portion of the total budget for the website development.</p>
<p>Related Read: <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/agile-software-development-process/" target="_blank">The Agile Software Development Process – How We Do It</a></p>
<p>The total requested time and cost for backend development are influenced by a lot of factors such as complex queries, non-standard data processing tasks, such as working with audio, integration of third-party services, etc.</p>
<p>At this phase, the preferred tech stack is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Web frameworks: Phoenix, Ruby On Rails</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Web Servers: Apache, Nginx</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Programming languages: Elixir, PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Database servers: MySQL, PostgreSQL</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud server platforms: AWS, EC2, S3, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to our experienced web development consultant team, the minimum time required for seamless backend development is almost 80 hours. And the maximum time limit can vary between 250-255 hours.</p>
<h3>c. Content Management System</h3>
<p>When it comes to web development, content is king. But you also need a proper Content management system to manage and optimize the content of your website. Remember that your website is not just there to sell your brand or service to the site visitors, but to communicate your vision to them. And that’s why you need to make sure the content of your website is of the best quality.</p>
<p>The content management systems are software that will enable you to change the content on your website without having to ask the developer for every single change you are about to make.</p>
<p>Now you are going to find many popular CMS services online. CMS services like WordPress, Joomla, Silverstripe and many more. Depending on your website content requirements, you can choose any of these services. Or, you can develop a custom CMS for your website.</p>
<p>Why though? What’s the point of developing a custom CMS service when you can easily access the above mentioned CMS for your websites. There are plenty of reasons for that, but here are the two main reasons-</p>
<p>Firstly, online readymade content management systems are really limited and they might not suit your website goals and types. Also, the popular CMS services are always a better target for malicious software than the custom ones. And that’s why even though it might be a little costly, developing a custom CMS is going to be better for the success and security of your website.</p>
<h3>d. Third-party Tools Integration</h3>
<p>Depending on the website and industry, the site will definitely need some integrated third-party services. And these costs need to be included when looking for the answer to the question of how much does it cost to get a website developed? Some of the most popular third-party services to integrate are mentioned below.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Social media integration: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Payment gateways: Stripe, Braintree, PayPal, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Delivery services: FedEx, EasyPost, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Maps and Navigation: Google Maps, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Analytical tools: MixPanel or Firebase, Google Analytics or Flurry, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing integration: MailChimp, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Some Essential &amp; Unavoidable Cost to Start a Website</h2>
<p>If you are thinking that the above expenses are enough, then you need to think again. Because the above-mentioned factors and features are all a matter of consideration, and the cost depending on them can vary. But the essential costs of website creation, the domain name, and hosting services, you have to pay for.</p>
<h3>a. Domain Name</h3>
<p>You probably know what a domain name is, but in case you are not aware of what a Domain is, let us tell you.</p>
<p>A domain is the name of the site. It needs to be registered before one starts to use it, and two sites cannot have the same domain. Users can use the name to visit the site directly. Here are a few websites where site owners can buy new site domain &#8212;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">GoDaddy</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Hostinger</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Interserver</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bluehost</li>
</ul>
<p>The price range starts from approximately $5 and ranges up to $15 yearly.</p>
<h3>b. Hosting</h3>
<p>The loading time of the website depends on the quality of the servers. And that’s why you have to be careful about choosing the right hosting provider.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some of the trusted hosting providers to understand what starting a site will cost you.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">GoDaddy</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Inmotion</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Ionos</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Hostgator</li>
</ul>
<p>The hosting cost range starts from approximately $75 and ranges up to $200 yearly.</p>
<h3>c. Updates</h3>
<p>In case you have chosen to go with the self-hosted website, then you will have to update the software and servers yourself, which means that it will cost you some significant amount of money.</p>
<h3>d. Premium renewals</h3>
<p>Most of the third-party plugins and tools you use for your website use the license model. They offer support and updates for a limited time, and in case you miss that, you will have to pay a couple of extra bucks to renew the license.</p>
<h3>e. SSL certificate</h3>
<p>A commercial SSL certificate needs to be renewed after a set interval of time. This is another additional expense for your website.</p>
<h3>f. Security</h3>
<p>The security of the website needs to be of utmost importance, and that’s why the site data needs to be backed up regularly. This process becomes easier with a premium hosting solution. So consider the security charges as well when making a site development cost blueprint.</p>
<h2>So, How Much It Will Really Cost To Put Up A Website?</h2>
<p>Giving an exact figure for website development pricing is tough! Experienced web developers need to see all the requirements. Also, they need to understand what to do in detail. Only then they can figure out the actual website setup cost.</p>
<p><strong>On average the answer for how much does it cost to build a website can vary between $2500 to $95000 and more. Again, KEEP IN YOUR MIND that depending on the customization you want on your website, you may expect to pay more than the mentioned price. Also, the required time to build a website varies depending on the requirements.</strong></p>

Important factors like attractive photography, powerful visuals, and a perfect overall format are some facets that engage the first-time visitor to your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great style is the foremost conduit that can attract a user to judge the website. For example, a neat and suave site proves the clients that the organization is proficient and shows in their plan. A great design implies that your organization will probably have solid establishments. A vigorous outline can show the energy of your business and how well it can oversee the challenging job. Finally, you require your website to be an impression of your business&#8217; best values and qualities.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Navigation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is very important to have a clean and logical navigation to increase usability. Usability signifies how quickly and easily a visitor can find information on your site and make the complete action. The action includes converting the interest on a call to action. A clean navigation with less option and robust search criteria helps to manage a clear path for a visitor to approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Consider the distinctive sorts of guests you need to transform into leads. For the most part, alluded to as top, center, and base of the channel. Top of the channel guests know close to nothing or nothing about your services and are searching for instructive assets. Center of the channel guests have some information about your services and are one bit nearer to getting to be clients, typically hoping to do research, and differentiate your services with different organizations. The base of the channel guests know your organization and the services it gives and normally is prepared to buy and are searching for meetings or quotes. You ought to have a route choice for each of them. Giving an excessive number of route alternatives dissipates clients everywhere on your site, sending them to assets that are immaterial to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Convenience goes past simply having a coherent, clean route. Moreover, it additionally implies using reliable styling for components, for example, joins, features, suggestions to act, pictures, and so forth. Consistency is critical; it&#8217;s a decent approach to help the guest know what distinctive components on your site do. For instance, picking a color for your links and catches and adhering to it over your site builds ease of use. It&#8217;s about making it as simple as possible for your guest to explore and understand the substance on your site.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Conversion Opportunity</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Change is the way to driving a decent lead through your site and assembling every one of the parts of good website architecture to be effective. A transformation way is an adventure a client takes to really turn into a lead. For each sort of client whether it is a top, center or base, there should be a reasonable way. For instance, consider a client who is top of channel client to a modern coatings website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They realize that they should make their structure or gear free from rust yet they don&#8217;t know which item or services will be valuable in doing the job. They do some Googling and find your site. Each client data gathering begins at the landing page. Likely this is the place where style come in help in making the early introduction and influences the visitor&#8217;s view of your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the site is easy to use and traversal, then there ought to be a clear choice accessible in the route for investigating rust prevention alternatives on the landing page. The client then grounds on a services page and sees the data. It ought to have the capacity to skim through the page and discover the services which would be most pertinent to them.</p>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the place typography will prove to be useful, having the capacity to discover rust counteractive action choices. The guest is skimming through all the meaningful and usable data on the administration&#8217;s page. He understands that he doesn&#8217;t have all the comprehension of rust anticipation to know the contrast between every one of the alternatives accessible. Along these lines, this is the place the invitation to act is valuable to download a top to bottom guide. The plan of the invitations to act can prevent or increment the change rate.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Social Media</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Social media plays many variables with regards to marking, and can truly stand for the deciding moment relying upon your system and techniques. With more than 80% of customers counseling Social media before they buy an item, it&#8217;s never been more imperative to use this device boost your changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, social media is now very instantaneous. The clients are progressively swinging to this medium as their first port of call for client benefit. If a bundle hasn&#8217;t been conveyed, the odds are your client will take to Facebook or Twitter to tell you. For this reason, they will be sitting tight for a reaction from an email. If you are believed to be respondent via social media, and you seem to offer accommodating customer services and guidance, clients will turn out to change over. The more human and minding your image shows up, the more trust clients will put on it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another approach to tackling the quickness of Social media is to offer flash sales and social-only exclusives. This will invite clients into changing over if there&#8217;s a world-class feel, or a feeling of urgency summoned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Above all, these are quite recently a part of the courses in which effective website design and the power of Social media can have bridled to enhance conversion on your B2C website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Hope</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Smiles from the threshold of the year to come,</em></p>
<p>Whispering &#8216;it will be happier”<br />
<em>&#8211; Alfred Tennyson</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2016, UIPL is going to witness a new dawn with the arrival of another year and open a new chapter in website designing and development, similar to the quote mentioned-above by the famous American poet, Alfred Tennyson.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2015 was a wonderful year for us and in order to make it more productive and continue to be on the growth trajectory in the coming year, we have chalked out some plans, which will be our sketch map towards becoming the best <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>website design and development company</strong></a>. It has been our constant endeavor to empower the imaginations by offering creative and innovative app and website development services. <b> </b>So, we share with you, our vision for 2016 in website designing and development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>a) </strong><b>Sketch App For Creative and Interactive User Interface</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are planning to introduce Sketch while designing the user interface whether it is about designing low fidelity wireframes or designing an icon and high fidelity mockups. This app might help our designers to design the vector elements while working on a variety of interfaces. With some similar features from the Photoshop such as layer styles and text effects, the app won’t pose many problems as far as its usability is concerned, but at the same time is expected to simplify the work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>b) </strong><b>Browser-Based IDEs to replace Desktop IDE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have plans to introduce browser-based IDEs to simplify the process of writing codes. A browser-based IDE gives coding suggestions as well as the option of syntax highlighting in comparison to a desktop IDE that is only limited to Xcode and Notepad++.With the help of cloud-based browser IDEs, it might become easy for our developers to write code from any computer even without an internet connection. One of the browser-based IDEs is CodePen, which comes loaded with customized pre processors like LESS/SCSS and Jade/Haml.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>c) </strong><b>Card Layouts Format For Websites</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to manage those web pages that are filled with more and more content, we intend to follow the card layout format. It enables the visitors coming to the website to scan the content easily. For instance: You might have noticed that the home page of Google Now is based upon the card layout structure in order to leave space for the Google Now apps. By providing more dynamic grids to a website page, a card layout helps to put more emphasis on the content.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>d) </strong><b>Video Tutorials Are An Easy Way To Learn. Isn’t it, so why not do it?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are planning to upload videos in our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, in order to give a better understanding of the products and services we offer to our clients. To a layman, it might become difficult to understand a technical term used in the app making process. We will post videos related to mobile app development, <a href="https://unifiedinfotech.wordpress.com/2015/10/26/hey-thats-a-wrong-way-to-put-up-responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">website designing</a> and development so that it becomes easier for the customer to get a hands-on experience of the way we develop an app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>e) </strong><b>No Need To Learn A New Programming Language, Native JS Mobile Apps Are There</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We use Java for Android and Objective – C or Swift for iOS in order to develop the apps, but sometimes a need might arise from the client’s side to make use of a new language while making a mobile app. If this type of situation arises, we can make use of Native JS apps in order to help the developers built a mobile app according to the requirement of clients and without learning a new language. A number of native apps are available in the market these days such as <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank">ReactNative</a> or <a href="https://nativescript.org/" target="_blank">NativeScript</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>f) </strong><b>UX Design For Better Information Architecture</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make the user experience, even more wonderful we want to introduce UX designs and implement it across all platforms of digital interfaces. With the help of UX design, we will improve the information architecture and interactive designs. One of the most important benefits which we will derive by introducing UX design is that we will be able to determine that our products have all those features which our target audience are looking for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>g) </strong><b>A Little Motion with Cinemagraphs For Your Web Pages</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping in mind about the latest trends in web page designing, we plan to include cinemagraphs in the web pages as it gives a livelier experience to the visitors. How many times did you come across a website that has a little motion in its images? Well, the trend of using cinemagraphs in a website is on the rise and hence, we will design the web pages keeping in mind about the importance of cinemagraphs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>h) </strong><b>Introduce Server Side JavaScript</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Node.js is on the rise as far as the preferences of the developers are concerned. It helps to make a website with the help of one language, both at the front and backend, hence, we want to introduce this server side JavaScript in order to make website designing a fun experience. Most of the industry leaders are opting for server side languages when it comes to implementing the basic design of a website, hence we are ready to cater according to the client’s requirement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>i) </strong><b>No More Multiple Pop-ups</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The era of multiple pop-ups when multiple tabs used to open as soon as we used to click a website is over. Neither will we recommend to our clients nor will we implement it in our website. People want clean websites these days, which are clutter free and are free from any unnecessary advertisements, thus building a pop-up free website will be one of the main agendas in our vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our vision in 2016 is to attain the status of being the best website designing company in this era of technological development. We want to be on the growth path and witness success in every venture we undertake in the near future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UIPL family wishes everyone a Happy 2016. Have a wonderful year ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Making your website visible in the top ten Google search is the best way to promote your business because that’s how leads are generated and your business keeps getting more traffic. After all, the ultimate purpose of any business is to earn revenue. As online marketing is increasingly becoming popular, an SEO friendly website with a good website design is the key for getting a good rank as well as earning a good revenue from your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Converting a website into an SEO friendly one does not happen overnight. It requires time because a website with a good Google Rank not only includes inserting the most popularly searched keywords over the net but a proper synchronization between them and a good website design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An interesting point to note about the most popular websites on the net is that they have an excellent design along with a well-planned keyword strategy. Hence, website design plays a vital role in making your website more SEO friendly. A <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>web designing company</strong></a>, whether small or big takes into account the designing aspects that are necessary to make it appear more presentable to the user and then starts developing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/psychology-of-web-design/" target="_blank">UIPL has some ultimate website designing tips</a> and techniques that will make your website more SEO friendly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s time to have a look at them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I. Web Designing Tip 1: Make Your Website A Responsive One</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to a <a href="https://marketingland.com/nielsen-time-accessing-internet-smartphones-pcs-73683" target="_blank">Nielson report</a>, more people browse internet through Smartphones or Tablets rather than sitting in front of a TV. Hence, your website needs to be easily accessed through a mobile phone. This is possible only with the help of a responsive web design. When you have a responsive template, your website can be opened in multiple screen sizes irrespective of it being a static template files or a <a href="https://unifiedinfotech.wordpress.com/2015/11/26/5-cms-website-development-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them/" target="_blank">CMS</a>. The more accessible you will make a website for the visitors, the more they will find it useful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>UIPL’s Tip:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>To create a static website, choose WordPress – the best Content Management System.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>II. Web Designing Tip 2: Make your Website Rich with Texts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This does not mean that you will stuff your website with content. Search engines always find it easier to crawl through a website that has rich and valuable content. Do not leave your website blank without any product description. Include text on every page related to your products or services. For instance: if you have an image of your product or have uploaded a video, include a 150 words description to let the readers understand about your product as there is no chance of physically inspecting the product online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>UIPL’s Tip:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>a) Keep your title limited within 50-60 characters.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>b) The meta description should be between 150-160 characters.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>c) Place the contact details such as phone numbers, e-mail address or any contact information just below the image so that an interested person can immediately contact.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>III. Web Designing Tip 3: Optimize Your Product’s Image</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4258 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Product’s-Image-compressor-1.png" alt="Product’s-Image--compressor" width="655" height="389" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Product’s-Image-compressor-1.png 655w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Product’s-Image-compressor-1-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know that optimizing the images of your <a href="https://unified-infotech.blogspot.com/2015/10/portfolio-websites-must-haves.html" target="_blank">website</a> increases the possibility of appearing more frequently in the search engine? That’s why it is necessary to optimize the images for your website along with texts that will make your website appear more frequently when searched with the keywords.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>UIPL’s Tip:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>a) Change the file name or rename it with the keywords related to that product.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>b) Have a small caption for all your images.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>c) Use HTML codes for the images.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IV. Web Designing Tip – 4: Make The Navigation Structure Text-Based</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Making the navigation of a website text-based helps search engines to read the content of your website easily. Although, there are a number of options that are available like JavaScript or Flash, but a text-based navigation structure is one of the easiest ways to get traffic to your website. It uses the anchor text of the links to evaluate the importance of the hyperlinks in the content of your website. Moreover, you can customize the text anytime you want it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>UIPL’S Tip:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>a) Always have a complete linking structure.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>b) Have a well-planned hierarchy strategy for your website.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>c) Always use shallow deep navigation structure.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>V. Web Designing Tip – 5: Use the Redirecting Strategy Intelligently</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the common mistakes done by web designers is a wrong ‘Redirecting’ strategy. If you are planning to remodel all your content and design the layout of your page in all new format with a new website address, then do not delete the old pages. When you delete all the old pages, you not only remove the data but also lose the traffic, as the redirecting option is no longer available. The existing visitors to your website will view an ‘Error 404’ message if they are unable to access your new website, hence it is mandatory to maintain your old page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>UIPL’S Tip:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>a) Change the URL of your page to ‘301’.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>b) Take the help of the ‘<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/" target="_blank">Redirection plug in</a>’.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>c) You can also create an .htaccess file by using the code redirect 301 /your-page /your-new-page on your web server.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Read More: <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/building-a-seo-friendly-mobile-website-designs-with-uipl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BUILDING A SEO-FRIENDLY MOBILE WEBSITE DESIGNS WITH UIPL</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is true that SEO boosts up the ranking of your website, but at the same time having a well-designed template acts as an icing on the cake. Whenever a person visits a website, he always looks for information that will solve his query and give solutions. With the online industry getting competitive day by day, your website needs to have something unique that will always make it stand out from the plethora of websites that are already in the market. It is thus imperative to have a good combination of keywords and at the same time a great website design in order to make your website stand out from other and generate leads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The website designing tips mentioned above will help you to regain the lost traffic of your website by making it more SEO friendly. Designers and Developers spend endless hours in making a website. A properly structured SEO plan will certainly help your website to get a good traffic.</p>

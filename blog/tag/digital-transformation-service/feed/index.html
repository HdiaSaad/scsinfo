										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="id_1">Introduction</h2>
<p>The entire gamut of business went through turmoil as soon as the pandemic hit the globe. However, amidst all these, the business world has also undergone some remarkable, unseen, and positive changes. Entrepreneurship picked up, remote work culture became the new normal, E-commerce scaled newer heights and what not! And all these have been possible due to the huge digital transformation that has been happening over the last few decades or basis the need that evolved due to the recent pandemic.</p>
<p>Well, when it&#8217;s about digital transformation, the telecom industry proved to be one sector that not only sparked the revolution, but has also been the flag bearer since long time now. To note here, telecom industry has almost become a synonym to this digital shift.</p>
<p>But then, this trajectory shift in digital space is the outcome of facing unknown or unheard challenges, overcoming them, and finally building robust technologies to bring in a digital revolution. In this blog, let&#8217;s have a look at some of the greatest challenges faced by the telecom industry and how it overcame them while maneuvering this remarkable <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/what-is-digital-transformation/">digital transformation</a> in real-time.</p>
<h2 id="id_2">Challenges of Implementing Digital Transformation in Telecom Industry:</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge #1: Super Fast and Responsive Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>While customers don’t like to wait in queues, customer service providers were not able to handle or respond to the large volumes of calls they received. Attending such humungous amount of calls and responding to them required large number of human resources, which again made the process cost-ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>Solution #1: Putting Artificial Intelligence (AI) Into Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>As a technology, AI has been developing competencies in telecoms. AI has changed the old school ways of attending customers, handling their queries, resolving them, and boosts customer engagement.</p>
<p>These days, businesses are focusing more to become an omni-channel contact centre platform software platform. Telecom industry is putting AI into customer service and engagement to make this happen across all levels. Virtual customer assistant, chatbots, and other AI powered tools are best examples of how telecom industry is making digital transformation a reality in today’s world.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #2: Handle Complex Business Processes</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13551" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-13551" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1.jpg" alt="Handle Complex Business Processes" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1.jpg 640w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13551" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Business processes usually get more complex with the high influx of data. As the data flowing in spike up, processing them or extracting information out of them gets more complex. With only human computing abilities, handling this enormous amount of data is near to impossible. And once data is lost, businesses start losing their growth and revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Solution #2: Machine Learning to Automate Businesses</strong></p>
<p>Automating businesses was one of the greatest digital transformations in telecom industry. Here, Machine Learning (ML) initiated developing competencies in telecoms by empowering machines to learn on their own over time and process massive amount of data in no time. Furthermore, by developing advanced ML algorithms, telecom industry brought in a new digital transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #3: Rise in Remote Working Culture</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13552" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-13552" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture-300x246.jpg" alt="Remote Working Culture" width="300" height="246" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture-300x246.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13552" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Remote working is the new normal and there is no denial about this! However, with the advent of this new normal, organizations started facing a new set of challenge &#8211; how to build a centralized work model wherein data can be made accessible to every employees, how to stay in sync with the employees sitting across different locations, or how to build a connection between employees and their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Solution#3: Introducing Cloud Hosted Telephony Solutions</strong></p>
<p>With these cloud hosted telephony solutions, organizations can now easily build a centralized data storage that can be managed and accessed from anywhere in world. Also, since data is stored in the cloud, it became easier for organizations to build a seamless human-device connection. By investing more on this cloud-hosted telephony solutions, service providers are bringing in a massive digital transformation in the telecom market.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #4: Rise of OTT (Over the Top) Platforms</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13547" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13547" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13547 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms.jpg" alt="Rise of OTT (Over the Top) Platforms" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms.jpg 640w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13547" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>OTT platforms started growing exponentially since last decade, thanks to the smart phone revolution! The arrival of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Netflix, and others have affected the telecom sector in infinites ways. As a result, revenue generation in telecom market started dipping largely.</p>
<p><strong>Solution#4: Develop Advanced Digital Content Delivery Network</strong></p>
<p>Another milestone digital transformation in telecom market is the development of networks to deliver digital content. Telcos adhered to the rise of OTT platforms and started building cloud hosted telephony solutions through which digital content be distributed via high-speed broadband or Wi-Fi, or even through mobile data packs.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #5: Old School Legacy Systems</strong></p>
<p>Legacy systems are traditional systems are either outdated or can no longer support the objectives of a business. Legacy systems proved to be one of the most challenging factors in the overall digital transformation of businesses. You can read more <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-fsi-legacy-systems-and-modernization.pdf">Legacy Systems</a></p>
<p><strong>Solution#5: Modernizing Legacy Systems</strong></p>
<p>The modernization of legacy systems is yet another remarkable digital transformation in telecom industry. The process requires reviewing and updating business requirements, which leads to assessing all the existing codes. Following this, advanced systems are developed to optimize overall operation and performance of a business. Even though this is quite a complex process, it ensures a high ROI to businesses.</p>

Such informed decision-making ensures the complete success of the process. So, hop on to the train, get reading, and opt for some digital transformation consulting!</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. What are The Types of Digital Transformation?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">While some brands are still missing out on the full benefits of digital transformation by viewing it in a narrow concept, its benefits like the &#8211;</p>
<figure id="attachment_12623" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12623" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12623 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/digital-transformation-2.png" alt="digital transformation 2020" width="768" height="238" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/digital-transformation-2.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/digital-transformation-2-300x93.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12623" class="wp-caption-text">Source: runmyprocess.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">-can better be understood if they start to fathom out the types of it. This includes &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Business Model Transformation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This aims to ensure the values that are delivered in the industry of the business that forms the fundamental blocks of any trade. The examples of this are well-established over the reinventions that stretch from &#8211;</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Uber’s taxi industry</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix’s video distribution, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Multiple efforts are still under process when it comes to transforming the business world into a robotic exercise, especially in the fields of mining.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With this, brands can stand at the doorway of new and innovative opportunities that boost their growth.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Organizational or Culture Transformation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital transformations, in the long run, have a substantial impact on a brand’s capability, approach, and talent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These aspects are redefined and all that it requires- </span></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bias towards learning and testing,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increased reliance on the ecosystem of businesses,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Agile workflow, and</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Such companies initiate steps that would bring in alterations to their working. This type of digital transformation and the subsequent changes are a long-term requirement for success.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Process Transformation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Brands, as of now, implement multiple technologies that include the automatic robotic process that aids in the streamlining of the back-office processes that include legal and accounting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such digital transformation holds certain values. These include adopting the latest technologies. </span>This process is a speedy one, becoming table-stakes. Such changes are effectively focused around areas of business.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Domain Transformation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is one area that is seldom focussed on but holds the potential for an immense opportunity. With blurred industry boundaries, redefined services, and products, the new technologies often fetch non-traditional brands.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Amazon has exploited this digital transformation type and definitely expanded the market domain to a substantial extent.</p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Why Does Digital Transformation Matter For 2020?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A review suggests that only a mere <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/digital-transformation/#why-does-it-matter-now">23% of the brands</a> are not yet relying on digital tools for their operations. The largely-written message of success via digital transformation has reached the ears of each of the companies, it seems. With predictions of increased spending on this transformation (<a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/what-is-digital-transformation#q2">CAGR growth of 16.7% from 2017 to 2022</a>), multiple organizations are boosting their share of investment (from the capital budget) in the wish of gaining assured and higher returns via spiked revenue.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">For Customers</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The ease of doing business, improvised customer experience, and lower churning</p>
<figure id="attachment_12624" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12624" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12624 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/digital-transformation-for-customers-1024x497.png" alt="consumer experience in digital transformation" width="1024" height="497" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/digital-transformation-for-customers-1024x497.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/digital-transformation-for-customers-300x146.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/digital-transformation-for-customers-768x372.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/digital-transformation-for-customers.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12624" class="wp-caption-text">Source: cbsistatic.com</figcaption></figure>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">For Operations</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Quicker response time, improved efficiency, and reduced support costs.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">For Employees</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Boosted engagement, improved efficiency, and lower employee turnover.</p>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. What is the Digital Transformation Framework?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The framework for digital transformation is subjected to alteration based on the layout of the demands and challenges of an organization. However, there exist a few common themes and constants in the framework, irrelevant to the brand that adopts it.

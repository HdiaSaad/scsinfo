										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when the season of Holi (the festival of colors), a group of extremely competitive people, and the tradition of rangoli come together? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why a Holi special Rangoli competition!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When our amazing HR team revealed the idea of the Rangoli competition to us on the 2nd of March, the entire office geared themselves up for a fun-filled competition. With 7 teams ready with colors and unique design, the competition on the 6th of March was not only fun but intense as well. </span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12111 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech.jpeg" alt="rangoli competition at unified infotech" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech.jpeg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech-1024x576.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Competition Begins</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competitive and artistic spirits of all 7 teams that participated showed up when the competition began at 1:00 pm. Whether the competitors have an artistic streak or not, everyone got ready. Assembled at the designated place of the competition, we all arranged our colors and other instruments necessary to create the designs that will fetch us in the first place!</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12112 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-e-1.jpg" alt="rangoli team e" width="478" height="637" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-e-1.jpg 478w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-e-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team E with their finished rangoli!</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12113 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-design-team.jpeg" alt="rangoli design team" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-design-team.jpeg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-design-team-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-design-team-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-design-team-1024x576.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there was only 30 minutes allotted for the entire competition, the atmosphere in the room was definitely charged. Teamwork became the most important thing to create rangolis in a fast and precise manner.  </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12110 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli.jpeg" alt="rangoli" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli.jpeg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-1024x576.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team B pouring all colours of effort and hard work into their rangoli.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not Just Competition, But A Chance To Have Fun</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted it was a competition, and of course, all of us wanted to win, but that doesn’t mean we didn’t have fun! With the colors and good company, the competition became more fun than ever! </span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12114 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F.jpeg" alt="rangoli team F" width="1056" height="792" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F.jpeg 1056w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F-1024x768.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1056px) 100vw, 1056px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team F having fun with the colors!</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12115 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-a.jpeg" alt="rangoli team a" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-a.jpeg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-a-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-a-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-a-1024x576.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team A working together to win the competition. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Winners</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though each rangoli was a piece of unique art in itself, we had to pick three winning teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first place went to Team B. It was unsurprising because Team B mainly comprised of our best designers, and that makes it kind of obvious that they will be the ones to win the rangoli competition. Their design reflected the colorful spirit of the celebration itself. Not to mention they were the most prepared team of all, prepared with colors and design from the beginning. </span><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second place was grabbed by Team A. The enthusiasm, spirit, and experience in making rangolis paid off as they took the bag of goodies for second place in the competition. Their rangoli explored the unique blend of colors and the auspicious image of Ganesha was created to not only drive the team to do better in the competition, but also to bring good fortune to the company!</span></p>

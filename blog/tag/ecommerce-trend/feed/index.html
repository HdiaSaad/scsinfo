										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online shopping has become a common practice around the world. But the significance of ecommerce future trends have come to the forefront especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. When quarantine and work-from-home became the new normal in 2020, businesses and emerging ecommerce companies had no choice but to go digital. This has contributed to e-commerce’s share of global retail trade from 14% in 2019 to about 17% in 2020.</span> (source: <a href="https://unctad.org/news/how-covid-19-triggered-digital-and-e-commerce-turning-point">Unctad</a>)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to research by Statista, e-commerce’s share of total retail sales in the US surged from 11% in 2019 to 14% in 2020. Since then, there has been no turning back for these businesses.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13428 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-924x1024.jpg" alt="e-commerce’s share of total retail sales" width="924" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-924x1024.jpg 924w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-271x300.jpg 271w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-768x851.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-1387x1536.jpg 1387w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01.jpg 1671w" sizes="(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="id_1">1. Taking Your E-Commerce Game Up a Notch</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With new trends enhancing e-commerce, online <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/customer-experience-design-secrets/">customer experience</a> (CX) and store engagement have become intimately tied to business outcomes. Customers have high standards and have become particular regarding their expectations from brands. So, if your website is not appealing, 38% of users will stop engaging with your content.</span> (Source: <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/compelling-stats-website-design-optimization-list">Hubspot</a>)</p>
<h3>So, how should you build a robust website/apps that also converts?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We at SCS INFO have helped our clients to digitally transform themselves using the best practices while staying ahead of the competition. To know more, please see our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/">ecommerce website development services</a> (web/apps, saas development) &#8211; 1200+ solutions delivered for small and medium businesses, funded startups, enterprises, and Fortune 500 clients globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To augment your website’s UX+CX and achieve your business goals across all the stages of the customer journey i.e. from lead generation to conversion, customer engagement and loyalty, we have listed some b2b e-commerce trends:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR to Boost Customer Experience (CX)</strong> &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital platforms are using augmented reality to empower consumers’ shopping experience. Now, shoppers can get a preview of products and services in real-time through the ‘try on’ or ‘view’ feature. </span>The beauty and cosmetic industry is leveraging the power of augmented reality (AR) to transform the e-shopping experience. With the help of AR, consumers can virtually full-fill makeup applications to mimic how they would try cosmetics on at a traditional brick and mortar store.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> – With the help of AI, companies can deliver hyper-personalized and enriching customer experiences.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are two of the most powerful AI powered ecommerce future trends that can skyrocket your top of the funnel (TOF):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Voice Commerce Powering CX</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Why type when you could easily voice your query? If an e-commerce store does not have a digital assistant, this can be a major drop-off point for users. They will get tired of typing out their queries as it slows down their shopping experience. An Emarketer survey revealed that 40% of internet users in the US use voice search. Evidently, businesses can leverage the ‘voice-to-cart’ technology to boost a website’s engagement rate and sales.</span></li>
<li><b>Customer Service Chatbots</b> &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer assistance chatbots can really help to convert visitors into customers. Like in-store salespeople, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/chatbot-can-use-business/">chatbots help consumers</a> complete their purchase and offer after-sales support. This is a way for businesses and emerging e-commerce companies to communicate with customers (including communication using regional languages) and resolve their issues then and there. In fact, 40% of millennials say that they use chatbots daily as they provide answers instantly.</span> (Source: <a href="https://www.slicktext.com/blog/2020/04/chatbot-statistics/">Slicktext</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Big Data for Personalized Experience</strong>&#8211; Online stores do not have retail salespeople to recommend products or answer shoppers’ queries. That is why it is crucial to have human touchpoints in a customer’s journey on e-commerce platforms. To mimic a user&#8217;s personalized in-store experience, online retailers are extracting customers’ information through their social media, browsing behavior, and prior buying patterns. Successful e-commerce brands are leveraging analytics to make UX data-driven and target consumers with exactly what they desire and even more.</li>
<li><b>Headless Commerce: A Solution to Increase Sales</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headless commerce is the separation of the front end i.e. the marketplace, user interface, graphics from the back-end that manages the product details and the portal&#8217;s entire functioning. This allows e-commerce website development companies being more creative, allowing freedom and flexibility to offer unique and personalized services to customers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8vZbbsCbVU8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2 id="id_2">2. Conclusion: E-Commerce UX Trends Are Here to Stay</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging ecommerce future trends have gained a lot of traction in 2021 already, driving more traffic to businesses and converting them into potential customers. The pandemic has made us realize how powerful e-commerce is. In fact, it is predicted by Nasdaq that by 2040, 95% of purchases will be through e-commerce platforms.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge &#8211; the forever ‘best friend and worst enemies’ in the Archies comic series? Remember their unending shopping sessions with Archies being dragged behind them?</p>

<h2 id="id_1">1. Numbers Speaking Volumes About E-Commerce Trend 2020</h2>
<p>Kick-starting this read with a few statistics about the prospect that e-commerce holds in 2020 and beyond.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12763" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12763" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12763 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/market-stat.png" alt="market stat" width="512" height="361" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/market-stat.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/market-stat-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12763" class="wp-caption-text">Source: statista.com</figcaption></figure>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a look into the commodity online shopping (as of May 31, 2020)</li>
</ol>
<p>With such promising numbers for the E-commerce sector, this COVID-19, and the ensuing span of uncertainty over health issues even post the breakout, the future of online shops looks promising enough. Taking a cue from this, businesses can be rest assured to step on this boat and progress with their business expansion endeavors. Here come the two of the spearheading questions &#8211; how and why. Let’s start on with this section of the topic!</p>
<h2 id="id_2">2. Accelerating The Business Growth With E-Commerce During Pandemic Times</h2>
<p>The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus hit the world and its economic drop back like never before. As it emerged, the globe wasn’t prepared for this ‘Black Swan’ of a situation. The digital world was a step ahead but, with its slowly escalating progress in the field of online shops. However, with COVID-19, this pace of catching up to the online shopping platforms was boosted considerably.</p>
<h3>A. The How</h3>
<p>With businesses, prior to the pandemic outburst, had an option &#8211; to go online or not, but now with the novel virus on the global roll for an indefinite period, there are no options &#8211; they <i>HAVE </i>to go online.</p>
<p>Subsequently, all trades are in the race to set up their branding face over the online platforms. In this rat-race of a situation how to set up your online shop &#8211; one that &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Appeals to clients,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Lures them from your Top of the Funnel content to the purchasing point, and</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Gains their loyalty?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how &#8211;</p>
<h4>Keep The Product Content And Information Relevant And Accurate</h4>
<p>Clients &#8211; a majority of them are new to the online shops, especially for their daily merchandise. The last thing that they need is a dispute between the product description and the original merchandise.</p>
<p>Your online shop thus necessarily needs to comprise relevant links to scientific and medical authorities and rich content, irrespective of the market relevance of the product.</p>
<p>Ensuing this, your products must be discoverable, one that caters to the cross-sell and search.</p>
<p>Categorize the products under the relevant categories so as to ensure that they appear in the perfect searches.</p>
<h4>Implement Fair Marketing Price</h4>
<p>Running a yield-based pricing system or a marketplace? In both these cases, it is a mandate that you opt for a fair marketing price, one that wouldn’t frustrate your clients and not put you on the wrong side of the online shopping authority-guidelines.</p>
<h4>Accurate Delivery Dates Are A Must</h4>
<p>Imagine this &#8211;</p>
<p><i>You order a list of commodities whose delivery is dated a week from the date of order. The order arrives a week late. Would you, as a consumer, go back to the brand for another order? You would have, had there been no competitors. However, now you are spoilt for choices. </i></p>
<p>As a brand-owner, with a newly launched online shop, remember this instance. One such priority is the maintaining of the delivery date as mentioned in the site. This surely establishes the credibility of your brand and ensures the retaining of loyalty towards your brand.</p>
<h4>Out-Of-Stock Items Need To Be Labeled Accurately And Show No Tabs For Order</h4>
<p>A nominal and simplistic step at the initial look, but this forms the line between a well-developed e-commerce site and the one that is not. The sold-out commodities appear in your product list sans the warning that they aren’t available and your potential clients are easily misled. The result &#8211; a huge adverse impression of your site. Now, that isn’t something that you would want, right?</p>
<h3>B. The Why</h3>
<p>Businesses are leaving behind a Hansel and Gretel trail of breadcrumbs via their setting up of the online shops. This would be effective in luring prospective clients towards their brand. Subsequently, it would transform these potential clients into its existing counterpart.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, why this sudden shift to the online platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">via the expert assistance of the </span><a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/ecommerce/new-york/new-york-city"><b>Top Casablanca eCommerce Development Agencies</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially during the first half of 2020? Needless to say, this has a lot to do with the novel virus on the loose amongst other factors. The latter has been listed below –</span> &#8211;</p>
<h4>The Obvious: Lockdown And Social Distancing</h4>
<p>COVID-19 is being said to have taken the globe a few years back over the chances of a dipping economy. However, the trade-world has found a way out of this over their e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>The only way out during the social distancing and the lockdown is to give power to the convenience factor over launching e-commerce platforms that ensure contact-free delivery of services and products. What better a solution than online shops with orders just a click away and an appropriate site that caters to the latest eCommerce web design trends!</p>
<h4>Offline Mode Will Soon Become Archaic</h4>
<p>Old customer methodology is set on its way to becoming archaic soon. While the requirements of clients to want to discuss business deals face-to-face remains the same, the feasibility of it becomes narrowed down with social distancing norms.</p>
<p>With efficient tools during the lockdown period, this can actually become a possibility. So, you get a shot at meeting client requirements albeit breaching the COVID-19 distancing norms.</p>
<h4>Large Distributors And Aggregators Are Marking Their Territories Globally</h4>
<p>Effective digital commerce channels with the pre-programmed business goals are the key to reach out to the clients. This is followed by a proper digital engagement of the customers. This is what the aggregators and large distributors are after.</p>
<p>However, you too have this leverage to buy their marketing engine and your digital power. All that you need is a shot at e-commerce launches and a laid-out strategy to fall in the footsteps of the big-shots in your genre of trade.</p>
<h4>Digital Experience = Experimentation Tinged With Innovation</h4>
<p>With the travel restrictions and the in-person meetings in control, the edge-case technologies now become largely viable. Apart from the ones already in place, there are multiple technologies that are emerging steadily &#8211; including AR, visual search, VR, etc.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These digital advancements bring in the possibility of innovation to leverage the customer experience by large.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And are, thus, more than often the preferred tech upgrades preferred by the </span><a href="https://www.designrush.com/"><b>Top Casablanca Mobile App Development Companies</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_3">3. Covid-19 And Businesses Challenges &#8211; Cause And Effect Relationship!</h2>
<p>While the prospect for eCommerce looks bright enough, there is something that needs to be taken into consideration &#8211; the trading world, as we knew of, till the pandemic breakout, wasn’t prepared to go all out into the online shops. Subsequently, it is obvious that the business realm is facing significant hurdles over going online.</p>
<p>Albeit acknowledgment of the challenges, meeting them with the best possible solution to the same is nearly impossible.</p>
<h3>A. The Challenges That Businesses are Facing</h3>
<p>Here are the challenges and their solutions to ensure that enterprises can launch in their updated and flawless online shops to engage their potential and existing clients ad enhance their experience.</p>
<h4>An overpowering e-Commerce storm</h4>
<p>E-commerce came on too fast, too strong for the trading world, it seems; leaving brands with too little a time to catch up with this storm. Then there is the issue with updating the online platform to match up with the trending eCommerce business trends and the digital techniques, website developments, and designs.</p>
<h4>Mushrooming competitors</h4>
<p>It seems like the entire trade-globe is going all out on investments and adding digital edges to their e-commerce approaches. With growing competitors in the field comes the imminent threat of better offers and discounts, and hence, divided clientele, considerably risking their revenue.</p>
<h4>Inadequate ICT infrastructure</h4>
<p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure has been a persistent struggle in the e-commerce sector during these times of pandemic. This often leads to a lack of capacity and awareness and issues with internet access. The issues are common with consumers and MSMEs.</p>
<h4>Promoting Usability</h4>
<p>Promoting usability is a prime concern for all trades going online. Sans this factor, it is near impossible to reach out and lure in your clients. However, the issue with promoting usability is updating the site consistently to meet the client’s varying changes.</p>
<h4>Regulatory and enforcement failures</h4>
<p>With pandemic on the loose, there is a failure of the uniform classification across various states in terms of diverse essential items. Despite the government permitting the delivery of essential goods, industry experts are of the opinion that multiple service providers are having hiccups with the procurance of permit passes. This runs valid for staff supply in each of the states.</p>
<p>While this is time-consuming, it has a substantial impact on client usability and experience.</p>
<h4>Creating customer appeal</h4>
<p>Customer requirements vary over time. Diverse client needs, make it difficult to map the same, and cater to the needs. Since creating customer appeal is largely based on this, it is obvious that the creation of customer appeal is a mammoth task.</p>
<h4>Enhancing customer experience</h4>
<p>What do you think eCommerce Web Design Services and development trend does to your client experience?</p>
<p>Well, It enhances the experience!</p>
<p>Since they are a constant and consistent update line, businesses would need to dedicate a team for their expertise. This is a new arena for the brands new to the online line of shops and hence the lagging.</p>
<h4>Broken supply chains</h4>
<p>A blurred distinction between the &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Stakeholders with importance to the commerce supply chain, and</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Stakeholders with no importance to the e-commerce supply chain</li>
</ol>
<p>-result in a broken supply chain that affects the service providers. The ultimate result? &#8211; a jammed demand cycle on account of the ripple effect on the timely delivery of consumer services and goods.</p>
<h4>Focus on websites &#8211; creation and update</h4>
<p>Updates and creation of websites are an absolute mandate for e-commerce sites. This has a lot to do with the existing competition in the market. The online shops need to be regularly updated with the trends in eCommerce industry to ensure that the site catches up to the needs of the Google algorithm and the clients as well.</p>
<h3>B. The Solutions</h3>
<p>While enterprises lie in the pool of unknown territories in the digital online front, the solutions are being put ahead by the pros in the field. All that they need to do is follow up with the eCommerce business strategy and be rest assured about a result-yielding site.</p>
<h4>Reset the branding evaluation with e-commerce sites</h4>
<p>When a brand meets its promised delivery date and offers quality merchandise and service, its brand label is re-evaluated and the clients get a new angle on the brand.</p>
<p>This is easily feasible over a well-functioning e-commerce site, one that is updated as per the latest eCommerce business trends and caters to the client requirements.</p>
<p>You can always approach your chosen best web designing eCommerce web design company in Casablanca and let the experts lead you towards the very best.</p>
<h4>Eliminating customer-brand friction</h4>
<p>Developing a brand-client relationship is one of the utmost important things that enterprises need to concentrate upon. Transparency about the brand &#8211; value via a well-developed e-commerce site ensures diminished brand-client friction.</p>
<h4>Smoothening payment gateways in websites</h4>
<p>Payment in e-commerce sites is a considerable hurdle that brands need to deal with. The first step in this regard is an offering of multiple payment modes accompanied by a completely secured SSL-certified site. This fetches the client’s confidence on your site via a credible brand image. With the spiked cases of cyberthreat over payment gateways, this is a crucial aspect, one that needs immediate addressing.</p>
<h4>Enhanced security of websites</h4>
<p>An e-commerce website sans the enhanced security aspects is as good as non-existent. What enterprises need to understand is that with online sites, clients are non-reliant on poor security sites since they are soon subjected to pursue the payment procedure.</p>
<h4>Convenient navigation across shopping-options</h4>
<p>With online shops, one of the primary expectations of clients is a clear interface with a smooth navigation facility. A site that would help them</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">With the categorization of merchandise and products and</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Let them smoothly shift from one page to the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means no digital glitches and maybe some animated 404 error pages to improve brand-image even during times of internet issues.</p>
<h4>Increase digitization in supply chains</h4>

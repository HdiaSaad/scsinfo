<p style="text-align: justify;">This quote by well-known author Alan Lakein is very true. If you are unable to plan, then it’s your own failure. A well-defined plan with a great strategy is the ultimate way to be successful. The same principle applies across companies, which offer <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank">website development service</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning matters a lot while it comes to content marketing. As discussed in the beginning it plays a pivotal role in transforming your business to a brand. Online retailers and entrepreneurs specially focus on it to spread the name of their business in every nook and corner of the world. This helps them to get prospective customers who can transform to real customers in the near future. However, budgeting forms an important part here. This is one area where every business whether big or small would love to invest. The returns on investment are fruitful and are long term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As per a research <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2017_B2B_Research_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>, about 29% of the total marketing budget forms a part of content marketing. In the last few years, the rise of digital marketing gave birth to content marketing. It constitutes a vital part in website development service. Till a certain time, it was due to lack of awareness for which content marketing didn’t come to the fore. Now businessman are utilizing it quite effectively to reap profits and witness a growth in their sales graph. Once you stop promoting content around your business, the awareness comes to a halt. This is not something, which gives results within a month. It takes some time for the results to show positive outcome.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The concept of traditional advertising is diminishing with the passage of time. People are now concerned about a brand’s online awareness. In other words, digital transformation has even gripped branding within its shackles. Businessmen now go a step further to establish their strong foothold, online. Be it social media or any other platform, a business deems to cease without significance online presence. An online content is shareable. It is customizable for a niche audience and is readily available throughout the year.  Moreover, it’s a business asset for any organization. Hence, setting apart a portion of budget is a good investment for a business.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">CMS Trends To Follow For The Best Website Development Service</h3>

They are applicable both for B2C and B2B customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rise Of Live Streaming</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The concept streaming live will grow in popularity in the coming year. Facebook already has this feature. The rest of the social media sites like YouTube and Snapchat are all set to adopt it. They are not only easy to host, but the most robust platforms. Live product launches, tutorials and product briefings will start trending. They will increase the customer engagement ten times more than the normal engagement. Hence, you must not forget to put live streaming as a part of your content marketing strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Virtual Reality Will Be The Hero</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to offer the best website development service, then don’t ignore virtual reality. Major companies have already begun using virtual reality to display their products. Small and medium will initially find it a bit difficult to adopt it. However, with the passage of time, they will certainly start adopting it. After capturing the gaming industry, for long, it is now time for VR to slowly proliferate through the consumer category products. For instance: NorthPole, the clothing manufacturer is effectively utilizing the benefits of VR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Prominence Of Email Newsletters</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Email newsletters will again prominence in the coming year. If you are targeting B2B customers, then nothing works better than a newsletter. People evaluate a company after going through the factual data of newsletter. Hence, there is nothing better other than this document. Though, five years ago, email newsletters were not as famous as it is now, but recently it is showing great results. The engagement level has gone a notch higher. Hence, in 2017, there will be an increasing need to communicate with the top-level management in a clear manner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Push Advertising To Diminish</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Native advertising will replace push advertising. Customers don’t find pop ups, paid ads and banners too impressive any more. Rather, it becomes less relevant for people who love to surf online. Native advertising is now a part of the marketing strategy to garner the attention of the customers. So, if you are an agency offering website development service, you must not forget to take advantage of native advertising. Remember, advertising is an essential part of marketing, so it will not diminish completely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, last time we gave you the idea about <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/create-a-music-streaming-app-like-spotify/" target="_blank">what it takes to build music streaming app</a></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span>like Spotify!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haven’t read it already? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But are you aware of the music streaming app in detail?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is numerous music streaming apps in the market. The competition is intense. Ever wondered why Spotify is holding onto the top position for so long?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is right here!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us take you through the block level details to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build music app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music Streaming App Categorization</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primarily music streaming apps are categorized into on-demand music streaming and radio stations. Let us tell you more about the music app ideas.<br />
</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">On-Demand Music Streaming</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name suggests, music apps in this category play audio as per user preference. You can choose what you want to listen to. These music apps collaborate with popular music labels for collections. They also assist with music rights and royalties. Popular music apps like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoundCloud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Music, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">etc. belong to this category.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio Stations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio stations provide non-interactive music streaming experience to the users. The radio stations play audio which is trending. There is no option for user preference music. Some of the popular radio station apps are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandora Music</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">iHeart Radio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The users cannot play music as per their preference. They have the right to skip certain audio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brands need to collaborate with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SESAC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and BMI</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for licensing rights. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The licensing payment is less for radio station apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you planning for music streaming app development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Is yes, you have landed the right space- on-demand music streaming is your segment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, it is important to know what you are up against. Spotify is the king of music apps. It is a pioneer in this segment with its standout features.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Spotify Came in the Limelight</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify rules the music apps sector with its whopping user base and revenue figures. Midia Research stated Spotify user count of 96 million in 2018. That’s staggering 36% hike than 2017 figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the last quarter of 2018 alone, 9 million new subscribers joined the Spotify bandwagon. Premium subscription revenue stood at 4.81 million euros. The ad-supported revenue was 1.17 million euros.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-8629 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-2018-earnings-midia-research1-1-1.png" alt="music streaming app development subscribers" width="2000" height="1145" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-2018-earnings-midia-research1-1-1.png 2000w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-2018-earnings-midia-research1-1-1-300x172.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-2018-earnings-midia-research1-1-1-768x440.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-2018-earnings-midia-research1-1-1-1024x586.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever wondered the reason behind its success?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well! The answer lies in the strategies and user offerings. Spotify did not land on the successful platform overnight. It implemented viable business factors that connected well with the target audience. It evolved well with time to emerge as a market leader.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology Baseline For Music Streaming App Development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology forms the backbone for music streaming apps. No matter how good that idea looks on paper, it is the technology that determines performance. It is essential to know the technology stack that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build music streaming app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just the way you want it. Also, if you are thinking about how to build a music streaming website and technology for the same, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/" target="_blank">have a look here</a>.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/create-a-music-streaming-app-like-spotify/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8711" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/music-steaming-app-development-cta-3-1.png" alt="music streaming app development cta 3" width="981" height="227" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/music-steaming-app-development-cta-3-1.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/music-steaming-app-development-cta-3-1-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/music-steaming-app-development-cta-3-1-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that Spotify stores the music in servers. So, when a user requests a track, it is sent to user device directly. The music files are cached in the user devices. Hence there is no need to retrieve them again. This setup is supported by a basic memory caching system, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cassandra and PostgreSQL.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use Python and Javascript for technology stack development for your music streaming app. PHP is used to a certain extent on the server side. And, Java is used for backend development. Spotify primarily uses this methodology.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to manage costs and get stunning results, we recommend this technology stack:</span></h3>
<p>• NodeJS can be used for data management and processing in real-time.</p>
<p>• Amazon CloudFront facilitates video streaming across different locations with the help of wide-ranging protocols. They are layered on top of HTTP.</p>
<p>• Another effective addition to the AWS Elemental Media Services is Amazon Content Delivery Network (CDN). It allows effective implementation of two types of video streaming. Firstly, on-demand content streaming that is stored in Amazon S3. It is also known as Amazon Simple Storage Service. Secondly, is live streaming or 24&#215;7 channels.</p>
<p>• Another effective tool for on-demand video streaming is Wowza Video on Demand (VOD) software. Users can stream high-definition videos to any device seamlessly. It supports adaptive playback, content security, and VOD playlist creation.</p>
<p>• AngularJS or ReactJS is useful towards UI/UX design for mobile and desktop app.</p>
<p>• BootStrap or HTML5 is effective for web app development.</p>
<p>• Nginx is good to have a tool as open source HTTP. It also acts like a proxy server.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Features That Will Make Your Music App Stand Out</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know how Spotify made it to the top spot? It&#8217;s the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">music streaming app features</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Apart from having an extremely versatile music collection. Let’s look into some of the unique features that this admired music app showcases. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Get Info About What You Hear</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify has a triple-dot button in the Now Playing panel. It has a “View Album” and “View Artist” option. The first one shows the album in which the song appears. And, the second option shows more songs from the same artist.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Playlist Recovery</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to listen to a track from a playlist created a while ago? But, accidentally deleted it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry as Spotify can recover your playlist. You just need to sign in to your account in the web client. There is a “Recover Playlists” option in the left panel. You just need to select the playlist of your choice and hit “Recover”. And, hola! You can enjoy your long heard track.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Enjoy Music Offline</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, that’s true. You can enjoy your favorite music even without an internet connection. This feature is available to the premium subscribers. Users can download up to 10,000 songs. This is effective even when you want to save on your data usage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, this can be done in 5 different devices. But your music streaming app development partner must have got enough experience to achieve this. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify touches the user’s music requirements in the most intricate way. The detailed service line and features prove its worthiness for the top position in this segment. Most mid level music app development companies, do give this a miss. But it has to be your best bet.

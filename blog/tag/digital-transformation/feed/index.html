										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="id_1">Introduction</h2>
<p>The entire gamut of business went through turmoil as soon as the pandemic hit the globe. However, amidst all these, the business world has also undergone some remarkable, unseen, and positive changes. Entrepreneurship picked up, remote work culture became the new normal, E-commerce scaled newer heights and what not! And all these have been possible due to the huge digital transformation that has been happening over the last few decades or basis the need that evolved due to the recent pandemic.</p>
<p>Well, when it&#8217;s about digital transformation, the telecom industry proved to be one sector that not only sparked the revolution, but has also been the flag bearer since long time now. To note here, telecom industry has almost become a synonym to this digital shift.</p>
<p>But then, this trajectory shift in digital space is the outcome of facing unknown or unheard challenges, overcoming them, and finally building robust technologies to bring in a digital revolution. In this blog, let&#8217;s have a look at some of the greatest challenges faced by the telecom industry and how it overcame them while maneuvering this remarkable <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/what-is-digital-transformation/">digital transformation</a> in real-time.</p>
<h2 id="id_2">Challenges of Implementing Digital Transformation in Telecom Industry:</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge #1: Super Fast and Responsive Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>While customers don’t like to wait in queues, customer service providers were not able to handle or respond to the large volumes of calls they received. Attending such humungous amount of calls and responding to them required large number of human resources, which again made the process cost-ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>Solution #1: Putting Artificial Intelligence (AI) Into Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>As a technology, AI has been developing competencies in telecoms. AI has changed the old school ways of attending customers, handling their queries, resolving them, and boosts customer engagement.</p>
<p>These days, businesses are focusing more to become an omni-channel contact centre platform software platform. Telecom industry is putting AI into customer service and engagement to make this happen across all levels. Virtual customer assistant, chatbots, and other AI powered tools are best examples of how telecom industry is making digital transformation a reality in today’s world.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #2: Handle Complex Business Processes</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13551" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-13551" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1.jpg" alt="Handle Complex Business Processes" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1.jpg 640w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13551" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Business processes usually get more complex with the high influx of data. As the data flowing in spike up, processing them or extracting information out of them gets more complex. With only human computing abilities, handling this enormous amount of data is near to impossible. And once data is lost, businesses start losing their growth and revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Solution #2: Machine Learning to Automate Businesses</strong></p>
<p>Automating businesses was one of the greatest digital transformations in telecom industry. Here, Machine Learning (ML) initiated developing competencies in telecoms by empowering machines to learn on their own over time and process massive amount of data in no time. Furthermore, by developing advanced ML algorithms, telecom industry brought in a new digital transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #3: Rise in Remote Working Culture</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13552" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-13552" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture-300x246.jpg" alt="Remote Working Culture" width="300" height="246" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture-300x246.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13552" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Remote working is the new normal and there is no denial about this! However, with the advent of this new normal, organizations started facing a new set of challenge &#8211; how to build a centralized work model wherein data can be made accessible to every employees, how to stay in sync with the employees sitting across different locations, or how to build a connection between employees and their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Solution#3: Introducing Cloud Hosted Telephony Solutions</strong></p>
<p>With these cloud hosted telephony solutions, organizations can now easily build a centralized data storage that can be managed and accessed from anywhere in world. Also, since data is stored in the cloud, it became easier for organizations to build a seamless human-device connection. By investing more on this cloud-hosted telephony solutions, service providers are bringing in a massive digital transformation in the telecom market.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #4: Rise of OTT (Over the Top) Platforms</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13547" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13547" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13547 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms.jpg" alt="Rise of OTT (Over the Top) Platforms" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms.jpg 640w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13547" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>OTT platforms started growing exponentially since last decade, thanks to the smart phone revolution! The arrival of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Netflix, and others have affected the telecom sector in infinites ways. As a result, revenue generation in telecom market started dipping largely.</p>
<p><strong>Solution#4: Develop Advanced Digital Content Delivery Network</strong></p>
<p>Another milestone digital transformation in telecom market is the development of networks to deliver digital content. Telcos adhered to the rise of OTT platforms and started building cloud hosted telephony solutions through which digital content be distributed via high-speed broadband or Wi-Fi, or even through mobile data packs.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #5: Old School Legacy Systems</strong></p>
<p>Legacy systems are traditional systems are either outdated or can no longer support the objectives of a business. Legacy systems proved to be one of the most challenging factors in the overall digital transformation of businesses. You can read more <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-fsi-legacy-systems-and-modernization.pdf">Legacy Systems</a></p>
<p><strong>Solution#5: Modernizing Legacy Systems</strong></p>
<p>The modernization of legacy systems is yet another remarkable digital transformation in telecom industry. The process requires reviewing and updating business requirements, which leads to assessing all the existing codes. Following this, advanced systems are developed to optimize overall operation and performance of a business. Even though this is quite a complex process, it ensures a high ROI to businesses.</p>
<h2 id="id_3">How SCS INFO Can Enable Telecom Clients Globally in Digital Transformation?</h2>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">What is digital transformation?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Search online and you’ll be bombarded with thousands of digital transformation definitions. Some will talk about how it is the integrations of the latest tech solutions within the business process. Some, on the other hand, talk about how it is almost a spiritual business change. In the end, you’ll close that tab with one question in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“What is digital transformation for MY business?”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s look at the definition.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. What Is Digital Transformation: Popularity, Definition &amp; The Benefits</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Digital transformation, also known as DX or digitalization happens to be the most popular search query right now. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/870924/worldwide-digital-transformation-market-size/">Statista</a>, the direct digital transformation technology investment amount is going to reach a total of $6.8 trillion between 2020-2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All entrepreneurs are gearing up to turn their businesses into the next digital sensation. But before joining that crowd, you have to understand what it means.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Duality Of Definition</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is no single definition for digital transformation, despite its popularity. And it is mainly because everyone has a different definition of the term &#8216;digital&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some will tell you that it is all about the integration of technical solutions. For others, it is the automation of the business process. And some groups believe it is a 360-degree change that impacts the business from the inside out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But which one of them is true?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13150" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-1024x986.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="986" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-1024x986.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-300x289.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-768x740.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-1536x1479.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-2048x1972.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, all of them are. Digital business transformation strategy is not a single faceted matter. In fact, it is a dynamic journey that includes both kinds of definitions. So let&#8217;s look at the different meanings of this process.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">a. The Narrow Perspective</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The narrow perspective of digital transformation is focused on only innovative technology solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The narrow definitions talk only about technology. Be it AI, AR/VR, blockchain, or IoT, it is always about how these solutions will help your business. However, it is not always inclusive of specific business needs.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">b. The Broader Perspective</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The broader perspective of digital transformation definition focuses on the process and people involved. It is a complete transformation of the older business structure. This transformation impacts the employees and alters the way they can provide valuable experience to the consumers.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">c. What Is Digital Transformation: The Combined Perspective</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">You cannot define digital transformation focusing on only one of the perspectives. They are both parts of a complete transformation effort. And that’s why the combined definition looks something like this-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><i>“Digital transformation is the integration of necessary technical solutions within the business process. It alters the existing work model &amp; organization culture, streamlining the communication &amp; collaboration efforts of the employees. Overall, it helps to reach business goals and deliver better value to the consumer at the same time.”</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><i>The combined definition covers all the necessary parts of </i><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/digital-transformation-strategy/"><i>digital business transformation strategy</i></a> <i>one can find online-</i></p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">It includes the matter of business/enterprise technology solutions. <i>(Not FOMO based technical integrations)</i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Includes the matter of the existing work model &amp; cultural change. <i>(To be digital, the employees must think digital)</i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">And lastly, it includes the employees and consumers as well.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that is the perfect definition of DX. Now let’s talk about how our experts at <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">Unified Infotech</a> make a digital transformation process work.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">

</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. The Process Of Transformation</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the definition above, we know that there are three aspects of the digital transformation maturity model. These are-</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The technology</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The business culture</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The people</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">The process of transformation will also depend on these three aspects. So what does the process look like?-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13146" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-768x767.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-1536x1534.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-2048x2045.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 1: Beginning With A Purpose</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beginning with a clear purpose is the first step of complete transformation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/8/digital-transformation-how-lead">Jay Ferro of Quikrete explained</a>, “Digital transformation should begin with a problem statement, a clear opportunity, or an aspirational goal”. This way you can create a necessity within the employees. This sense of urgency drives up the speed of the transformation process.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beginning with a purpose will help you to clearly explain to the employees what the aim is. Knowing the endgame, the people involved in the process will be more excited about the whole journey. And this enthusiasm will make them more willing to fit into the new digital style.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Starting the process only with business technology solutions in mind will be a waste of resources. So ensure that the process starts with a clear purpose, a definitive “WHY?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 2: Determining The Scale</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not every organization is on the same level when it comes to its digital operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe the competitor is light years ahead of you when it comes to the modern business landscape. On the other hand, maybe they are just beginning with their attempts at transforming the business. Either way, the second step will be to determine its transformational stage you&#8217;re on.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On this second step, many professional services leverage the <a href="https://ceo801mstro0h2uinte.blob.core.windows.net/legacyassets/system/manifestos/pdfs/000/000/996/original/178.03.DigitalTransformation.pdf">5 stage model of digital transformation by Tony Saldanha</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13147" style="width: 864px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13147 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png" alt="" width="864" height="479" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png 864w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-300x166.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-768x426.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13147" class="wp-caption-text">Source: inthebooks.800ceoread.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">The model displays 5 stages of the digital work-process in a company. When you determine which stage your organization belongs to from the beginning, it will result in better planning. For example, an organization that belongs to the foundational stage will need more than a plan. It will need a robust training curriculum and in-depth insight into consumer&#8217;s favorite digital trends.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Based on the stage, you will have to craft effective plans for business operations management. So, in this second step, analyze your business process and define the scale of effort that is required.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 3: Choosing The Right Tech Enablers</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the step that focuses on the technical aspect of the process. Choosing the right tech enablers depends on two things. The first being your purpose. And the second being the stage of transformation your company belongs to.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When thinking about what is digital transformation, many only think of the tech-approach. The tech-first approach is the reason for failure for many organizations. And that’s why whatever enterprise technology solutions you focus on during this stage should depend on these elements-</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The main purpose of the entire transformation effort.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The stage of transformation you are aiming for.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The technical trends that are popular within your industry and among the competitors.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">These touchpoints will ensure that the innovative technology solutions provide real value to your business process.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 4: Focusing On The Cultural Change</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just having some business technology solutions is not going to be enough. You need to update the company culture to match the latest work process.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Streamlining the business process requires a level of cultural change within the company. This change includes an understanding of employee values, opinions, and expertise on the integrated solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A lack of alignment can cause the entire process to fail in the technical integration stage. Employees who don&#8217;t understand the reason for this change will be reluctant to make any efforts.</p>

According to her- the leaders must win the hearts of employees with tech initiatives. Otherwise, the effort will stall before it has any positive impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The people involved must be onboard with the digital transformation technology investments. Or, your efforts will fail before they can take a concrete shape.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 5: Optimizing The Complete Consumer Experience</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Transformation efforts should also aim for a better customer experience. There’s no point in increasing functional efficiency if it fails to elevate the quality of the CX.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The positive impact of digital transformation on customer experience helps to scale the business. For this, you must break down the institutional data silos first. With the use of combined insight, you&#8217;ll get a better idea of what people are experiencing. Based on the consumer input, you will have a better chance of enhancing the CX through proper digital solutions.<i> </i></p>

</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Blockchain Impact On Solar</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">At this point, we are all familiar with the concept of distributed/decentralized database, a.k.a blockchain. Popular for its bitcoin application, blockchain is now changing the solar industry as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Until now, there have been two breakthroughs in the use of blockchain in the solar industry. The first one being easy P2P trading of energy. And the second one being the reduction of fraud in the corporate trading of solar energy. Let’s look at these in details-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">i. Peer To Peer Trading Of Energy</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the significant breakthroughs is blockchain&#8217;s use for P2P power trading. And the blockchain experiment, funded by the Australian government proved this. With this process, homeowners were able to sell the leftover energy produced from the domestic solar fixtures in a localized manner. They were able to set their price and trade at will.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13133 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-824x1024.jpg" alt="digital transformation of the energy sector solar" width="824" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-824x1024.jpg 824w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-242x300.jpg 242w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-768x954.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-1237x1536.jpg 1237w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-1649x2048.jpg 1649w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite the negative sides, such as irregular prices set by individuals, this method has proven to be worthy. With this digital transformation method, individuals can now settle their funds faster. Earlier they would have to wait a certain period of time for their electricity bill and feed in traffics to settle. Now with blockchain, that process can be done almost instantly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, the ability to release tokenized funds upon meeting specific terms is another great benefit of this technology. The use of blockchain will help you to remove transactional friction easily for the solar organization. So don&#8217;t forget to pay attention to blockchain benefits when planning a transformation for your organization.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">ii. Efficient Validation &amp; Certification</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Corporate accountability is pushing companies to be more eco-friendly. As a result, more business leaders are trying to implement solar solutions in the business process. However, the use of clean electricity does not always mean eco-friendly. And that&#8217;s why solar companies are using blockchain certification for every unit of energy they sell.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the use of blockchain, solar power suppliers and corporates are building a transparent business relationship. Solar companies are using blockchain to provide a smart contract with every unit of power a big corporate buys. This way buyers can validate the certificate of origin. This use of blockchain in the solar digital transformation will help you fulfill the business objectives of going green.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. IoT Taking Solar To The Next Level</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unlike the traditional energy sector, the solar industry needs to use remote methods to generate energy. Most of their main pieces of equipment are usually on the field, facing the best and worst of nature. However, the IoT applications in the solar energy sector make equipment maintenance a lot easier.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The positive impact of IoT on the energy sector also includes reducing the complexity related to power grids. The cloud-based data gathering process helps to monitor various on-field gears in real-time. You can access the data from a centralized control panel easily, and take necessary actions. The IoT collected data can also be used for advanced analysis and preservation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">You know what digital transformation is! But have you considered being Agile during the transformation efforts?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/digital-transformation-in-manufacturing-industry/">The right kind of digital transformation strategy</a> helps global industries survive, sure. But sadly, very few look beyond the digital aspect of it. It is not just a matter of integrating technology solutions in the business. There&#8217;s more to it than what meets the eye.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And for this more aspect, you need the assistance of the Agile method.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">Focusing On A Singular Digital Aspect Might Be A Mistake</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">What is digital transformation?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The basic idea is all about the adoption of digital technology to remodel the old business process. There are many reasons why business owners think it is important for the business. Some of these are- enhancing the consumer experience, reaching business goals, and beating rivals easily.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important to embrace and make use of new technologies to improve the business process. But it is still not the make or break aspect of such efforts. Going digital means creating a business process that delivers value to the clients. It should also help the business to keep on growing exponentially. However, focusing on only the technological aspect of digital transformation trends is not the way to do it. And this is where agile methodology comes in.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Did you know?</strong> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/09/30/companies-that-failed-at-digital-transformation-and-what-we-can-learn-from-them/?sh=711ca9cd603c">In 2014, Ford attempted their hand at digital transformation</a> with Ford Smart Mobility, a new business segment. However, the attempt soon failed because the transformation was treated merely as a separate new venture. But they should have reinvented their entire business process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">Agile Methodology &amp; Digital Transformation Consulting: A Perfect Match?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The traditional digital transformation strategy is not enough to keep up with the evolving digital panorama. With the legacy transformation, you&#8217;ll be stuck in a static one department at a time process. And when you finish, it will be time to update the solutions altogether, again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13088 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match.jpg" alt="" width="825" height="630" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match-300x229.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Agile-Methodology-Digital-Transformation-A-Perfect-Match-768x586.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To leverage all the benefits of new technology, you need a flexible and all-encompassing plan. And with a flexible plan, you&#8217;d be able to keep up with the following-</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Market competitors</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Changing demands of target demographics</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Altering business needs</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keeping up closely with these three elements will ensure that all your business decisions have the right impact. And to keep up with such multiple aspects, you need the agile approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">four principles of agile</a> have already proven to be helpful in business process transformation. Whether it is utilizing new digital transformation trends or ensuring the flexibility of digital solutions, agile helps businesses in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">How We Turn Digital Transformation Agile?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Agile helps us to soften the rigidity of legacy transformation models. It also ensures the longevity of the solutions in supporting any business venture of our clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But how do the principles of agile help with forming the digital transformation roadmap? Here&#8217;s how we apply the four principles of agile and enhance the transformation experience for our clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Principle 1: Transformation Based On Necessity, Not On FOMO</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first agile principle demands that we pay more attention to the people &amp; interactions rather than tools &amp; processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This principle puts importance on the team members involved in the process. Rather than focusing on tools and methods, we rely more on individual expertise to form the digital transformation strategy for our clients</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Surprisingly, even now, many digital transformation endeavors are taken up due to Fear Of Missing Out. Young entrepreneurs are continuously pestered with buzzwords such as IoT, AR/VR, Cloud computing, etc. To stay ahead of the curve, business owners often integrate these solutions without thinking twice. However, such spur-of-the-moment decisions can cause further problems in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The combination of digital transformation and agile ensures that the process beings value to our clients. Our initial discovery &amp; research focuses on what kind of results the people involved in the process are looking for. Rather than get distracted by buzzwords, we concentrate on empowering our clients with a sensible plan.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Expert speaks:</strong> Digital transformation is not a simple integration of digital solutions, but changing your business to meet the new world business expectations &amp; goals. So before undertaking such a process, make sure you have some serious goals set and ready to be fulfilled.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Principle 2: Enabling Hands-On Transformation That Helps To Achieve Results</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Earlier, the focus of any development process was on creating thorough documents. But with agile, this focus shifted more towards continuous delivery of working solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Agile focuses on faster development and making changes based on client reviews. With this, the developers can create market-ready digital solutions in a lesser amount of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Similarly, the use of the agile principle helps our digital transformation strategy to achieve goals faster. Rather than holding meetings after meetings, we begin with a basic understanding of the business requirements and the expectations of the end-users. Then as we progress, we make the changes based on hands-on reviews.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our goal is to improve business methods with transformation efforts as efficiently as possible. And that is why we don&#8217;t base our process on assumptions. We aim for a more educated, review-based system, making changes according to client opinion after each development sprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Principle 3: Collaboration Methods For Better Tech Integrations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Successful transformation is not just about technical integrations. It is also about creating an organic link between our expert teams and clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To sustain the entire process and ensure the right results, we aim for an open and harmonious relationship with our clients. This helps us to understand their needs in-depth and search for growth possibilities. And for this, we use the latest communication tools, staying in touch with our clients constantly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13089 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/For-the-Collaboration-point2.jpg" alt="digital transformation consulting and tools" width="825" height="627" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/For-the-Collaboration-point2.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/For-the-Collaboration-point2-300x228.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/For-the-Collaboration-point2-768x584.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Principle 4: Responding To Changes With A Fluid Transformation Plan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes flexibility is needed to make a set of plans more effective. And that&#8217;s why we use the fourth principle of agile, which is- “responding to change over following a plan”. Here are some positive impacts of the application of this principle.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">1. Making Changes Becomes Faster &amp; Easier</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Digital transformation is not a monolithic occurrence. It is a continuous process that uses technical solutions to achieve business goals. This is why we need to pay close attention to the evolving tech scenario and make changes to the plan effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13091 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan.jpg" alt="digital transformation consulting strategy" width="825" height="630" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan-300x229.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Responding-To-Changes-With-A-Fluid-Transformation-Plan-768x586.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The combination of digital transformation and agile helps us to focus on new changes within the plan rather than follow the old and strict rules and documentations.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">2. Scaling With The Business Growth</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Businesses tend to grow and change requirements more often than you think. Such new variations usually happen based on trends, altered customer behavior, and business growth. However, to accommodate such changes, a modified digital transformation strategy is necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, the existing digital solutions need to be flexible enough to adapt to the times. In such a scenario, the agile approach helps us to create solutions that scale with the business as it grows.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">3. Pivoting Made Easy</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lastly, beginning with a set plan is good, but it also needs to be flexible. Unforeseeable changes happen all the time during the R&amp;D process, and a flexible plan can help with that. The fourth agile principle helps us to create a flexible plan that accommodates any sudden changes at any time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that&#8217;s how the four agile principles help us to digitally modify our client&#8217;s business. Now, before finishing off, let&#8217;s look at some major reasons why we choose this approach.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">Why We Like Going Agile For Your Digital Transformation Needs?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Due to many benefits, agile has broken its bounds of the IT industry. The use of agile in a digital transformation strategy helps focus on the solutions of real issues businesses face. This combination has a grounding effect on the otherwise lofty concept of hyper-business-automation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let us tell you about some major reasons why we prefer this approach when remodeling your business digitally.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Keeping Everyone Motivated</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our agile digital transformation roadmap puts the people involved in the project first. This empowers them to fulfill tasks with increased motivation. Additionally, this approach leans a lot on the personal and collaborative expertise of the team. This makes members feel responsible beyond the set tasks and keeps both the team and clients motivated to do the very best.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Did You Know?</strong> The majority of digital transformation attempts fail because of a DIY mentality. To really make the process a complete success, make sure you collaborate with proper experts who can bring added value to the transformation attempt and help you achieve all your goals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Delivering Value Continuously</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Traditional transformation efforts yield results over a longer period. However, those results can be ineffective sometimes. But our agile approach delivers continuous value that always measures up to the expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We apply the agile mindset while creating a digital transformation strategy as well as the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/website-design/">design and development solutions</a>. The shorter sprints enable us to integrate new designs and features quickly. The faster the integration happens, the faster we can send it in for client review. The speedy process ensures that our clients can keep up with the changing digital world at all times.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Improving Your Chance of Success</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Regular &amp; open collaboration helps to create a strong cross-organizational relationship. And such a relationship makes it possible to ensure continuous improvements, despite any difficulties.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The collaboration improves the existing knowledge on digital transformation trends for everyone. It lets them gather knowledge and implement it within the process. This way, the transformation efforts can keep up with the changing market trends effortlessly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Eliminating The Risk Factors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For all its benefits, such transformation efforts are not without any risks. Multiple factors put the success of business conversion stages in danger. However, the use of agile makes it possible to remove the risk factors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our collaborative process and short sprints make it impossible for any mistakes to slip by. Additionally, the speed and efficiency make the whole process a lot more affordable. This is how an agile digital transformation strategy can make that transformation journey smooth &amp; risk-free.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Unlocking The Secrets Of Digital Transformation Success: Our Agile Way!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Taking that first step towards the journey that is digital transformation seems daunting. But with proper agile digital transformation consulting it should become easier. To get the best results from this implementation is a little tricky though. You need to understand the true meanings of the Agile principles. And only then you’ll be able to reach the set goals.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">We are stuck in a whirlwind of pandemic, and it is now downright impossible to get non-COVID related medical consultation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Or is it?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, we are not able to go to the doctor’s anymore, that much is obvious! But the path to consultations and suggestions is not completely closed. The new models of medical apps like Practo are making it incredibly easy to connect with doctors on the go and access the much-needed consultations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These applications are gaining popularity fast. So in case you were looking to make an app, why not a look into this market?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As for development, don’t worry! We are going to explain all about how a doctor on-demand apps are developed and designed. Just stick with us during the discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, are you ready? Let’s go!</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. The Initial Market Diagnosis: A Data Collection Process</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">What demographic should we concentrate on?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What kind of experience do the users want from a medical appointment app?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why are the competitors succeeding? Or failing?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Starting the development without knowing these details is like taking medicine without a diagnosis. Both are harmful. And that’s why rather than being blissfully ignorant, we like to start the whole operation with a thorough discovery process. This helps to clarify all the doubts, and questions about the idea and creates a comprehensive picture for us to work with.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12934 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/13-1024x745.jpg" alt="healthcare application development" width="1024" height="745" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/13-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/13-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/13-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/13-1536x1117.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/13.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here is a list of things that needs to be done during this first stage-</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sit down with the client to talk about the application idea.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Administer in-depth market analysis.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Do conclusive contender research and create reports on their basic strategies.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">With this information, it’s time to move forward with the rest of the process. However, we have already conducted a little bit of market research on the doctor on-demand app. So why not take a look into that?</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">mHealth Market In Brief: A Market Of Success</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Health consultation apps were already on the rise, but now thanks to the pandemic, it is booming. Here are some fresh statistics to show how beneficial the doctor on-demand app is going to be in such a landscape.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The tele-medicine sector is gaining popularity because of the pandemic and the social distancing practice applied to prevent it. In fact, even medical professionals are preferring these apps where patients can talk to a doctor online.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. According to <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/digital-healthcare-market-7636">research</a>, the global healthcare market is expected to reach a CAGR of 26.30% and a valuation of USD 3,28,887.8 million by 2025.

<p style="text-align: left;">2. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/consumer-health-trends.html">Around 80%  of users</a> have admitted that even in the post-pandemic time they would like to keep using the doctor appointment booking app. In fact, more people are now comfortable with virtual and at-home consultation and diagnostics.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12921" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12921" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12921 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6851_Figure7-1024x943.png" alt="healthcare application development stats" width="1024" height="943" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6851_Figure7-1024x943.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6851_Figure7-300x276.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6851_Figure7-768x708.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6851_Figure7-1536x1415.png 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6851_Figure7.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12921" class="wp-caption-text">Source: www2.deloitte.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research clearly displays that </span>doctor on-demand<span style="font-weight: 400;"> apps are not just efficient, but a necessity at this point. And the next step to develop such a necessary web application is the planning bit. So let’s get started on that!</span></p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. A Good Plan Keeps Development Issues Away!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The information gathered in the previous stage is applied here.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the stage where we make a step by step plan to turn the online doctor visit idea into a reality. The main aim here is to get all the documentation in order so that the development stage goes smoothly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12935 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/our-process-1024x502.jpg" alt="healthcare application development process we follow" width="1024" height="502" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/our-process-1024x502.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/our-process-300x147.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/our-process-768x376.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/our-process-1536x752.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/our-process.jpg 1719w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The detailed plan serves to streamline the process, mitigating the challenges and issues before it even arises.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The documentations created at this stage helps the developers across the </span><b>Top Casablanca App Development Agencies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by offering them much-needed assistance during the entire online doctor booking app development process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, it is also the step where the application  features are determined. However, let&#8217;s save that discussion for a later part of this blog. For now, let&#8217;s jump to the design process. </span></p>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. Design: A Matter Of Healing Aesthetic</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s sit down for a moment first.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12922" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12922" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12922 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/webapplication_home_present.jpg" alt="healthcare application design for web application" width="825" height="879" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/webapplication_home_present.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/webapplication_home_present-282x300.jpg 282w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/webapplication_home_present-768x818.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12922" class="wp-caption-text">We designed a medical consultation application</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you approach any of the </span><b>Top Casablanca Digital Agencies </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">offering app development and designing, they will tell you that the process for doctor appointment app design is crucial. This is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">because it is the literal visualization process for the application. And when it comes to designing for an app like doctor on demand there are a few things to keep in mind-</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. The Target Demographic</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/consumer-health-trends.html">According to sources</a>, the number of senior health app users is increasing. And that’s why when designing and developing a health app that will be widely used among senior and elderly users, there are a few things we like to keep in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">i. For elders and users with eye problems, the design elements need to be big, easy to see, and read. A small design only hinders engagement levels and ultimately drives the users away.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Pro tip: Add a feature that lets the users optimize the UI element size. That’ll make it easy for them to personalize the experience.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">ii. Make sure that it is easy to complete actions on the screen. Keep an appropriate distance between diverse design elements such as buttons, images, and texts so that it is easy to consume the content as well as execute any actions on the screen.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12923" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12923" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12923 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tracking-sharing-location-screen.jpg" alt="healthcare application development for mobile app" width="825" height="619" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tracking-sharing-location-screen.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tracking-sharing-location-screen-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tracking-sharing-location-screen-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12923" class="wp-caption-text">UI for healthcare mobile app at Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">iii. <span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span>healthcare app development <span style="font-weight: 400;">&amp; design, it is important to keep the focus on key functionalities. Sure the web applications may benefit from social media integration, but we believe that it is better to keep the feature list simple and straightforward.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">iv. It is essential for the sake of elderly users to keep the navigation on the app simple, straightforward, intuitive, and easy to learn.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12928" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12928" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12928 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Home-screen-with-spacious-UI-design.jpg" alt="healthcare application development for mobile app" width="825" height="619" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Home-screen-with-spacious-UI-design.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Home-screen-with-spacious-UI-design-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Home-screen-with-spacious-UI-design-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12928" class="wp-caption-text">UI design by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">vi. Adding tutorials at the beginning will make connecting and chatting with a doctor easier. This way users can learn the basic use of the application and then explore different features.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Pro Tip: App coaching doesn&#8217;t have to be a one-time thing. Enabling users to access the guide at any time will enhance the experience even more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Virtual doctor software such as the one we are talking about has a large user base that includes individuals from all demographics. And that’s why we like to keep the interface all-inclusive when designing the app.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Accessibility Should Be The Main Aim</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Speaking of all-inclusive, let’s talk about accessibility!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the fact that smartphones make up half of the internet traffic, web app approachability is not an additional thought anymore, it is an indispensable policy. </span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nations all across the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are accepting this fact and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating approachability laws that make it important for designs to be useful for all kinds of individuals. And it will be a wise choice to obey these laws during the </span>healthcare application development <span style="font-weight: 400;">&amp; design process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12925 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/web-application-healthcare.jpg" alt="healthcare web application screen UI" width="825" height="879" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/web-application-healthcare.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/web-application-healthcare-282x300.jpg 282w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/web-application-healthcare-768x818.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Following the design customs as illustrated is required to make the application all-inclusive and helpful to the users. It is also vital in creating a valuable experience on the app.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Design For Simplicity &amp; Sustainability</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A medical appointment app that links doctors and patients in times of need has to focus on only one thing- how to make the manner of connecting easier.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that’s why all the design components need to contribute to this factor. The best apps for doctor appointments make use of simple interface design to help the parties connect and talk easily, without adding complications.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Bonus Case Study: How We Built Australia&#8217;s Largest Doctor-On-Demand App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we are speaking about building a doctor on demand app, here is a bonus sneak peek at one of the projects we worked on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our client was looking for a marketplace platform where a doctor&#8217;s conference could be accessed on-demand, at any time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting all the research, we took notice of the main hurdles as well as the main objective of the project which helped during the later stages of the entire project. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main Objectives</span></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a web facing administrator console for our client.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On-demand SaaS mobile and web application for clinics.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><b>doctor on-demand</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> application for doctors and other nurses/users to speak seamlessly.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges &amp; Our Solutions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project came with unique challenges, and they demanded to be addressed with the integration of equally unique solutions-</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Final Take On The Project</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the entire process, our focus was mainly on two aspects of the program, efficient interface and security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a systematic approach, we first set out to conceive user personas for all the individuals involved and crafted connected wireframes, eventually leading to the making of an interface that caters to individual users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system facilitates cloud storage, which means all the patient data is stored in a remote server securely. Added to this the accessibility setting only permits the right parties with the right credentials to access and use these data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result was an efficient application that ensured good experience as well as convenient access to </span><strong>doctor on-demand.</strong></p>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. The Features In Consideration</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The app is just another idea, and the feature list is what makes it a reality. For a functional and robust app, it needs unique features. Based on collected data, we have compiled a short list of features for such an app that enables individuals to connect and talk to a doctor online.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">A Personal Profile Creation</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Almost every app needs this feature. With this, the users can sign up for the service, create a profile, and personalize the experience on the online doctor booking app. This feature enables users to make the application usage secure and save crucial data from the intruders.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Convenient Search</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">This feature enables the users to search for physicians on the doctor appointment online app  The search and filter feature helps to find the right doctors based on factors such as experience, location, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12927 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tracking-sharing-location-screen-1.jpg" alt="tracking sharing location screen" width="825" height="619" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tracking-sharing-location-screen-1.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tracking-sharing-location-screen-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tracking-sharing-location-screen-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">In-app messaging and video chat</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is a necessary feature that turns the entire app from a basic healthcare application to a doctor on-demand app. In-app messaging keeps the doctor and the patient connected in real-time scenarios. It is easier, and an efficient manner to reach the doctor for a quick question anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12924 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screens-for-Instant-messaging-and-video-chat.jpg" alt="Instant messaging and video chat" width="825" height="619" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screens-for-Instant-messaging-and-video-chat.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screens-for-Instant-messaging-and-video-chat-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screens-for-Instant-messaging-and-video-chat-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The video- call feature takes connectivity to the next level. With this, the patients can talk to a doctor online and get a diagnosis despite having to obey the rigorous rules of social distancing in these awful times.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Pro tip: It is desirable to launch an app packed full of features maybe, but at the same time it can raise lots of complications. So go for an MVP approach.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Medical Notifications</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since it is an app to make doctor appointments, having this feature is necessary. With this, both the users and the doctors can stay informed and notified about the appointments, vaccination dates, and many other crucial information.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Integrated Payments</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">With an integrated payment option, the users would be able to pay for the online consultation right from the app. This will streamline the experience on the app even more.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">SOS For Emergency</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The unfortunate thing about medical emergencies is that it can appear at any moment. And that’s why during telehealth application development, developers need to integrate location tracking and SOS features in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With location tracking the app can keep a track of the user’s location and share that with designated people in case any emergency occurs and the user happens to be all alone. Add emergency response features to that, and the user would be able to summon medical help with just one tap of the fingers.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Document Scanning And Sharing On The Go</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Test reports, prescriptions, and bills are an essential part of the experience. That is why it only makes sense that the app has a feature that assists in managing all these documents. With this feature, it will be easier to manage and share the documents during online doctor visits.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With this, it is even simpler to share documents such as prescription and test reports the users chat with a doctor. It enhances the app, making the stressful process of medical conferences convenient.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">iii. Screen Reader Feature</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screen reader feature is necessary for those who have low vision. For those, </span><b>healthcare app developers </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">can utilize</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TTS services that apply deep learning methods to turn the content on the screen into voice over. This way users with visibility issues can enjoy the web application without any problems.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">iv. Voice Navigation</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Voice navigation is a popular feature these days. With this feature, users with mobility/motor issues can navigate and utilize the app. Amazon skills kit makes it super easy to integrate voice processes on the medical consultation software and increase the accessibility of the app.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">6. Bonus Technologies For Healthcare Application Development To Pay Attention To</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are some bonus technologies that the medical appointment app needs to enhance the app experience and stand out as a unique entity in the market. And our in-house expert highlights some important ones among them-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">i. Taking Consultation One Step Further With AR/VR</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Augmented and virtual reality in the telehealth sector has created quite a stir, and it is not a surprise that these are the top bonus techs to be considered for your app. This combination will streamline the entire virtual consultation as well as make the app stand out in a saturated market. By projecting digital information on the real-world layout, this will improve the quality of medical consultation on the app.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">ii. Decentralized Healthcare With Blockchain</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Blockchain can be a major solution for data policy problems for healthcare app development. This will bring security, scalability, and speed to the entire data processing and sharing operation. So during development make sure to pay close attention to any blockchain opening on the application.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">iii. Personalized Consultation With AI/ML</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">AI/ML can create a personalized experience on the virtual doctor software. It introduces an environment of predictive consultation, where the users don’t even have to talk to a doctor. Users can simply get suggestions from AI-based consultation features on the app that analyzes the symptoms and dispenses a number of diagnoses.</p>
<h2 id="id_6" style="text-align: left;">6. Test &amp; Maintenance: Two Extra Steps Towards A Perfect App</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Healthcare application development is not the last stop on this journey.  We always go two extra steps with you to really make the app absolutely perfect. What are those two extra steps? Well, they are testing and maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here’s how we implement it within the operation-</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Testing For Quality Check</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Evaluating the doctor appointment app prior to launch is a crucial step in determining the quality and strength. Skipping this will cause numerous problems in the future, for both the users and the app owners.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keeping all these aspects in mind, an online doctor booking app needs to be put through rigorous tests to see if it can stand up to the market standards. Here are some examples of tests that the app needs to go through prior to entering the market-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Regression Testing</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first iteration of the app is rarely the final iteration. There will be lots of changes before the doctor on-demand app reaches that final release stage. And to ensure that regardless of the new changes the app runs smoothly, we conduct retrogression tests. This makes sure that after every update, the previous code runs smoothly without any failures.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Automation Testing</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">To create a quality app, the testing stage needs to be as detailed as possible. And that’s why to make the online doctor visit app useful, this test becomes a natural part of the process. Automated evaluation is a time and money-saving test process removing human error in the development and testing.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Load &amp; Stress Testing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every app has a breaking point, and it is better to find out about it beforehand. And this is where the importance of these tests increases. In brief, these tests examine the behavior and strength of the application under real-life pressure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these tests, the </span>online doctor booking application <span style="font-weight: 400;">is put under the kind of real-life stress it is supposed to bear, and then some more. This determines how strong the application is and how much it needs to improve. Conducting these tests will ensure that the mobile and web app can run in any condition.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Going One Step Further With Maintenance</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Development is not the end of the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The perfect performance of the app is ensured with proper maintenance. With this process we keep up with the various app demands, editing and updating it, and ensuring the absolute security of the database no matter what.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The maintenance process is not just about keeping the doctor appointment app running smoothly. Throughout the process, it is our aim to scale and improve upon the basic app. It is also essential to keep the various licenses in check and renew them once terminated. If development is important to turn an app into a reality, then maintenance is important to keep the app standing and improve on it.</p>
<h2 id="id_7" style="text-align: left;">7. Before We Move To Healthcare Application Development: A Serious Consideration!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s address the matter of security before moving to doctor on-demand app development.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The matter of security on a doctor on-demand app is unavoidable. An app that streamlines contact between patient and physician is bound to contain some protected health information (PHI), and to ensure the security of all that data, there are a few security guidelines one needs to follow. These security guidelines go something like this-</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Legal Compliance</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Separate countries have diverse legal demands that need to be fulfilled for healthcare data protection. So depending on the target country and market, the healthcare app development process needs to comply with the data preservation laws and conditions. Here is a list of the three most familiar healthcare data protection regulations around the globe.</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act">HIPPA compliance</a> (USA)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8.6/">Personal information protection and documents act </a>(Canada)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General data protection regulation</a> (Europe)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since we are talking about apps like ZocDoc here, it is crucial that the app follows the legal guidelines of the market it is going to deal with.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/portfolio/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12852 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CTA-check-our-portfolio-.jpg" alt="check our portfolio" width="1650" height="1200" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CTA-check-our-portfolio-.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CTA-check-our-portfolio--300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CTA-check-our-portfolio--1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CTA-check-our-portfolio--768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CTA-check-our-portfolio--1536x1117.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Knowing The Attack Types</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Next comes comprehending the cybersecurity menaces. There are plenty of ways that the integrity of doctor appointment app security can be compromised. That&#8217;s why it is crucial to understand the various threats that can plague the application</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here is a basic list of safety threats on a doctor on-demand application-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">i. Malware And Phishing Attacks</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the most popular kind of security issue that plagues different kinds of software, especially healthcare. Hackers inject malicious scripts into the code and seek to steal the high-value patient data through hijacked login credentials. That is why it is crucial to integrate proper security strategies within the doctor appointment app development process to prevent such issues.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">ii. The Use Of Unprotected Mobile Devices On The Client End</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Users are going to access the app from various personal devices to chat with a doctor. Some will be protected, while some will be unprotected. In this case, it is going to be difficult to provide 360-degree security without failing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the solutions that can be considered is creating a zero-footprint app. In such apps to book doctors appointments, no data is stored on the patient device. Rather every instance the users access the data, it is connected to a secure server. This way the threat of unguarded devices can be alleviated without any issues.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">iii. The Use Of Connected IoMT With The App</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The use of IoMT is increasing. Patients, physicians, hospitals, and clinics, all parties are using healthcare apps with related machinery. This does raise the efficacy of providing quick and easy treatment, but at the same time presents certain risk factors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">IoT devices do not have integrated protection measures. The cloud-connected tools are vulnerable to diverse threats. And that’s why it is a safe bet to set up a contextual defense layer during hospital app development. This will isolate the IoMT devices on its own network and can be monitored closely to protect the app and data from any breaches.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Paying Attention To Industry Best Practices for Healthcare Application Development</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Several entities in the trade offer defense guidelines for the medical appointment app. <a href="https://www.wedi.org/">WEDI</a> is one of those establishments that contribute broad knowledge on various security and user protection subjects that can be integrated during development.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Following these data preservation best methods is paramount for the success of the app. So prior to development, talk to a doctor on-demand app development partner and integrate the best security practices.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">And That’s The Way We Do It!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As we said, the process is not easy. But with our in-house design and tech experts, we can streamline this process without any issues.

<p style="text-align: left;">-can better be understood if they start to fathom out the types of it. This includes &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Business Model Transformation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This aims to ensure the values that are delivered in the industry of the business that forms the fundamental blocks of any trade. The examples of this are well-established over the reinventions that stretch from &#8211;</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Uber’s taxi industry</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix’s video distribution, etc.</li>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such digital transformation holds certain values. These include adopting the latest technologies. </span>This process is a speedy one, becoming table-stakes. Such changes are effectively focused around areas of business.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Domain Transformation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is one area that is seldom focussed on but holds the potential for an immense opportunity. With blurred industry boundaries, redefined services, and products, the new technologies often fetch non-traditional brands.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Amazon has exploited this digital transformation type and definitely expanded the market domain to a substantial extent.</p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Why Does Digital Transformation Matter For 2020?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A review suggests that only a mere <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/digital-transformation/#why-does-it-matter-now">23% of the brands</a> are not yet relying on digital tools for their operations. The largely-written message of success via digital transformation has reached the ears of each of the companies, it seems. With predictions of increased spending on this transformation (<a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/what-is-digital-transformation#q2">CAGR growth of 16.7% from 2017 to 2022</a>), multiple organizations are boosting their share of investment (from the capital budget) in the wish of gaining assured and higher returns via spiked revenue.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">For Customers</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The ease of doing business, improvised customer experience, and lower churning</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">For Employees</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Boosted engagement, improved efficiency, and lower employee turnover.</p>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. What is the Digital Transformation Framework?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The framework for digital transformation is subjected to alteration based on the layout of the demands and challenges of an organization. However, there exist a few common themes and constants in the framework, irrelevant to the brand that adopts it. These are found amongst the published ad current case studies on these transformations. These cases are a mandate for those planning to adopt the transformation to ease in their started digital journey.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12625" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12625 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-transformation-framework.png" alt="digital transformation framework" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-transformation-framework.png 800w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-transformation-framework-300x207.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-transformation-framework-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12625" class="wp-caption-text">Source: aimultiple.com</figcaption></figure>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Digital Technology Integration</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The primary framework for the digital transformation procedure is obviously the integration of various digital technologies. However, prior to the integration, brands need to shortlist the digital technologies that cater to their specific demands and requirements that will help them soar to the zenith of business-success.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Customer Experience</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Customers are always on the lookout for ‘instant coffee culture’-like quick and instant solutions. Thus, it is obvious that one of the core frameworks of the digital transformation process is customer experience. On the other hand, considering that customer experience is prioritized in the recent era, the dal advancements should also cater to the same.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Pro Tip: <a href="https://www.teksystems.com/en/insights/state-of-digital-transformation-2020">84% of clients </a>believe that the experience offered by a brand is equally important as that of the services and products offered by it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Workforce Enablement</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">With digital transformations, one of the major frameworks is that of workforce enablement. The integration of digital tools that cater to the company’s new goals ensures that the operational functions of a brand run smoothly. The employees gain benefit from the assistance of such technologies. Such technological aids help in offering better productivity that helps in better revenue generation for the organization.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Operational Agility</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to the growing competition among brands, it has become an essential part to adapt and evolve to the latest digital changes. This is a constant procedure and ensures that the brands in question are able to improve faster and strengthen their foothold in their trade genre.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This can well be explained by the fact that customers are no longer in need to physically visit organizations to carry out their business demands. These listed out requirements can be conveniently shifted from one department of the company to another, thereby completing the work efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. What Are The Main Components of Digital transformation?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Considering that the digital transformation framework is transparent for the brands, there are issues that they face, at times. One of such issues is understanding if the digital transformation has been appropriately implemented and if it has transformed their business, or not. Gauging this is convenient, only if one is well-acquainted with the core components of the process. This includes &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Transforming Process</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look into your business process and check out the mode of business conduction. With a complete digital transformation, this mode will be subjected to a complete change bringing in a new process of operation. There will be no pause or flaws in the business transactions, only the mode of conducting business undergoes change. The expectation from the new model is that it will &#8211;</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Smoothen the process and</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Make it time-efficient and precise.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this regard, you can take into consideration the EDI system that automatically transfers information from one trading partner to the other. This suggests that employees need not spend too much time in submitting and drafting the PO (Purchase Orders), making it efficient and less time-consuming.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Transforming Operation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Digital transformation requires a significant alteration in the business operations. Despite using the latest digital technology for creating products, it is not compulsory that the business has undergone a complete digital transformation. For the latter to be feasible, the operation process needs to be changed post the transformation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To acknowledge the transformed operation process, let’s take into account the EDI systems again. This system offers a completely different operation procedure as in &#8211; this system notifies the organization of any delays or failures to submit the POS.

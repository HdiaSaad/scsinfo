This year, the statistics looks, even more record breaking with the total spending estimated at $8.4 billion and an average spending of $82.93 per buyer.  Now, you might wonder about the reason behind such booming figures. Well, there is no doubt that costumes form the major part of their shopping checklist. However, décor and toys also succeed it. Halloween marks the arrival of the holiday season followed by the Friday and Christmas sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To win over the customers, a flood of deals and offers on Halloween is something, which is not unusual for e-commerce websites. A buyer persona is something, which always remains on top of an e-retailer&#8217;s sales agenda. They make sure that they drive the maximum benefit from the users. Starting from social media to email marketing, PR, and Facebook ads, there are an ample number of digital things, which marketers use to arouse the interest of shopping amongst the users. Filling up an in-store entry form is yet another interesting way where a retailer can get an instant feedback and expectations from the customer’s side.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Understanding the buyer psyche is primary towards getting more customers not only for the purpose of Halloween but also for any seasonal celebration. It’s the fundamental process of expanding your business network and at the same time also increases the brand name.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The festive season is back again! Excitement has filled the air with the arrival of October. It’s time to fill up your wardrobe with the latest collections and flaunt the latest trend in town. Be it an online or a brick and mortar store, businessmen, have geared up for doubling their sales.

But are you all prepared when it comes to the ‘Big Day E-Sale?’ Well, let’s see that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Booming Ecommerce Business Scenario</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the arrival of the internet, there has been an online burst in the e-commerce industry. Today, we live in one of the most digitally enhanced worlds where there is no full stop to availing services online. There is a global upsurge in online shopping, as per this Forbes report. It claims that the global figures in Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, and North America will increase to 18%, 10% and 9% respectively from the current figures of 8.2%, 6.7% and 6.3% by 2018. Such huge rise in figures indicates the increasing global phenomenon of ecommerce web development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, the concept of digital technology has merged with e-commerce there by blurring out the line between the humans and internet. It has changed the way we look at shopping and is on a hunt for making it a more exciting experience. It is slowly shifting from device focused to people focus. Instant delivery service is an important factor that has always stood as a USP for most of the e-commerce websites all over the world. Instead of rushing to a store, a customer today signs up on an online shopping website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While there is plenty of room for improving the overall ecommerce experience but festive season is one part of the year, when eretailers want to generate the maximum revenue. When it comes to online shopping, it’s more about enriching the experience of the user. The more you engage the visitor, the less will be the bounce rate of your website. However, there is more than something to it. In this blog, you will find the best 5 festive season tips if you want to boost your sales. Follow these tips and you will definitely experience a rise in the revenue graph at the end of 2016.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Earn More Revenue With These Five Festive Tips</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tip 1: Monitor Traffic Flow</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use Google analytics to monitor your traffic and at the same time evaluate the relevance of your content throughout the web page. Analyze the keywords based on Click Through Rates. This will help you to focus on the keywords. Once done, focus on keywords, which bring more traffic. Use meta description and tags for ALT tags in images. Use such keywords in your promotional posts like blogs and articles. This will generate more traffic to your website for the targeted keyword.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tip 2: Uncomplicate The Shopping Process</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t make shopping too much complicated for your shoppers. Keep it easy and simple. The check out process should be simple. Don’t resort to practices like ‘sales close for today.’ This puts off buyers and they might not return the other day when you come out with a new offer. Keep limited information for the users. For instance: the personal details section should not ask too many questions. Send e-greetings card to the customer’s personal email address to let him know about any seasonal discount or offers. Send them attractive coupons often to keep them coming back to your ecommerce web development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tip 3: Promote Festive Season Specific Offers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do this in a clever yet engaging manner. Prepare customized mailers for your most valued customers. Prepare it in such a way so that it doesn’t sound like a publicity or advertising campaign. Make sure that it is appealing and informative. Take the advantage of cookies to get a more perfect idea about the shopping preferences of your customers. Social media is another area where you must concentrate. It’s the most effective way to promote your brand. People stay tuned to social media as they are always on the lookout for attractive festival offers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tip 4: Stop Doing Silly Mistakes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might not believe, but sometimes you commit some mistakes unintentionally for which you might have to pay a high price. The first one is not using the call to action words in the website for the appropriate product. Remember, that visitors must notice the call to action buttons in the page. Copied content is another factor, which is important. Use original and fresh content either in the product description or in any type of promotional content. If you fail to deliver the exact information, which your customer is looking for, it will put him away from the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tip 5: Have Sufficient Back up</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Website crashes are not something, which is unusual in festive seasons. Apart from maintaining a gorgeous front-end functionality, it is also important to make sure that your website is able to handle traffic efficiently. For instance: if your web page takes more than a minute to upload, then this is something, which you must look. Even before the festival season starts you must do a thorough check of the website with rigorous testing. If you can’t handle so many tasks, at least keep a backup for your eCommerce web development website ready, which can offer the best support to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get the most out of a festival season, the strategies of ecommerce web development company should be strong enough for a businessman to earn the maximum revenue. Instead of working hard, act smart. These festival season tips will open new paths for you if you are an online business baron.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Complicated navigation, small product images and difficult check out process are the primary points that make it too difficult for a prospective customer to complete the transaction process while shopping online.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Use Multiple Payment Options</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In e-commerce web development, payment is considered as one of the primary factors upon which the popularity of a website depends on.

<p style="text-align: justify;">More Security Features Everywhere</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been researched and found out that one of the primary reasons for customers to abandon the shopping cart is due to their distrust as far as the safety and security of the website are concerned. May be that’s the reason why Bitcoin is becoming an emerging concept in the field of e-commerce web development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stop Asking More Information</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The endless number of personal information that the user has to fill in not only irritates him, but also forces him to easily shift to a competitor’s website. This is a great loss for an e-commerce web development site whose operations have just started. So, it is better to ask the user for minimum information. This will ensure a smooth and a memorable shopping experience for the buyer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To offer customers a comprehensive and an immersive experience, e-commerce websites are introducing new features, bringing updated products along with other innovative solutions. Payment gateways are one of the major characteristics on which online entrepreneurs are focusing as this is the most deciding factors for retaining customers on a long-term basis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Magento has always been on the forefront when it comes to providing an innovative platform for setting up the infrastructure for an e-commerce website. It is a tool, which empowers merchants to capitalize the power of the digital platform and leverage shopping with the power of the internet. With more than, 50$ billion transactions taking every year, all most all the well-known business of the world rely on Magento. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Over the years, owing to it’s immense popularity, Magento has grown in popularity when it comes to opting for the best </span><a title="ecommerce web development USA" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>e-commerce web development</b></span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> solutions. Ever since it’s release in 2007, this open source e-commerce is out with various versions. No doubt that all the versions have proven to be immensely beneficial for the e-marketers, but the recent version has a host of benefits to offer. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>Updated version. New updates. Great Features </b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Yes! that’s what defines Magento 2 as compared to its previous versions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So, let’s take a look and understand how can the most recent version prove to be extremely beneficial as a tool for developing your e-commerce website.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Update 1. </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>An All New Folder Structure </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are some minor changes that have been made which can be spotted only by developers. For instance: error folders, index.PHP, get.PHP, cron.php and media folders have been moved to pub folder. In order to manage static content with CDN, the JS and skin folders have also been moved to the pub folder as well. Another notable change is the one in the theme folder, where the paths are named by vendors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Update 2.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Caching Is Now Available In Both Editions </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Magento 2 enables you to execute full page caching in both its enterprise as well as community editions. As a result, you will be able to cache product pages, category page, and CMS pages as well in the form of static HTML pages. Another significant advantage is that Magento doesn’t open the page to the user after making database queries. Hence, the page loading time is reduced. One can find the cached pages at the /var/page_cache folder. It gets updated automatically whenever any product is updated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Update 3.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Better Code Base</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Many design patterns of code have been used while making Magento. This will help the developers to use the patterns and create their own code as per the latest updates. In order to produce a quality code, number of documentation have been introduced related to designing the patterns while developing a software. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Update 4. </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Separate Databases </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In it’s latest version, Magento has come up with an all new interesting update. Developers can now maintain separate databases for enterprise edition only. A single database is now capable of holding the checkout process, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/5-payment-gateways-for-your-business/" target="_blank">payment gateway</a>, CMS, and the product categories. Moreover, order management has now become simple. All the databases can now have more than one ‘slave’ database, which will in turn serve as the back-ups or load balancers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Update 5. </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Optimizing Databases </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">One of the shortcomings of Magento 1 was that the website used to suffer from performance issues. This proved to be a great disaster for a website with high traffic. On the other hand, some systems require locking the database. Such things can crash the system sometimes and effect the performance of the system badly. Here, comes the role of Magento 2. It helps to optimize the problem by reducing the problems. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Update 6. </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>New Directory</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The process of store management has now become much easier as in Magento 2.0, the number of root directories have been reduced from 9 to 5. The directory pub will now contain data for publicity. This is more flexible than the previous version as one can now avoid the hectic task of creating numerous files in ‘skin,’ ‘error,’ ‘media,’ and ‘js.’ Thus, shop owners who were looking for a convenient solution can also have their application files located outside the web-server document root.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>Is there any difference between Magento 1 and Magento 2?</b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now if this question arises in your mind before you are about to take the final decision on whether to introduce Magento 2 as a web development platform or not, then you will be happy to know that it is technology that sets the latest version of Magento poles apart from its previous version.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Magento 1 comprised of four major technologies only – SaaS/Compass, Prototype JavaScript library, jQuery and additional JavaScript libraries only. Magento 2 comprises of a plethora of technological upgradations such as HTML5, CSS3, MySQL 5.6, CSS preprocessor, Apache 2.2, PHP 5.5.x, PSR Compliance, <a title="5 Must Have Magento Extensions" href="https://unifiedinfotech.wordpress.com/2015/04/03/5-must-have-magento-extensions/" target="_blank">Magento Toolkit</a>, and fill page caching. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Moreover, in all the previous versions of Magento manipulating a layout required the developer to have strong technical knowledge, but Magento 2 comes loaded with a Visual Design Editor that allows a drag and drop interface that makes the task of changing the layouts much easier. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>Renamed Tables in Magento 2.0 </b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are about to install Magento 2.0 then you should be aware that there are slight changes in the name of tables. To make things easier for you, we have prepared a table that will help you to notice the key changes</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>To opt or not to opt for Magento 2 </b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">You should grab it with both hands if you are planning to start your own business. With a plethora of beneficial services designed for you such as separate databases for processing orders, reducing code, rapid browser rendering, improved image compression and facility to cache static content, the blessings of Magento 2 cannot be ignored. Hence, Magento 2 will definitely yield good results for your business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">With so many technical improvements, Magento 2 makes the complex process of maintaining an e-commerce website much simpler. Both the enterprises as well as the community editions are flexible enough to make the task of developers easier.</span></p>

Colors are one of the tools used by the marketers to increase the conversions of their website. Now, let us see which colors should you use in a website that will make the contact page of your website flooded with business proposals and increase the number of customers.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Pink Is Not HER Favorite Color</b></li>
</ol>
<p class="western" style="text-align: justify;">Yes, you got it right! Women love green, blue and purple. They hate brown, orange and gray. Most of us are always under the impression that pink is a color that woman are in awe with, but that is wrong. In fact, many studies have shown that purple, green and blue are the colors that are liked by them. Visit any cosmetics website or a women’s magazine website and you will get to know about it.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><b>Purple Is Not HIS Favorite Color</b></li>
</ol>
<p class="western" style="text-align: justify;">Males do not find brown, orange or purple appealing; instead, they are mostly interested in black, green and blue. These colors exude manliness and, therefore, are a hot favorite among men.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><b>Blue Is The Color To Go With….</b></li>
</ol>
<p class="western" style="text-align: justify;">Believe it or not! This is the most widely used color today on the internet. Every website you come across and most of the social media pages are using blue color. The reason is that this color has a psychological effect on the mind of the visitors. There is an element of trustworthiness and serenity that one associates with this color and hence, blue is so popular among all brands. However, do not use the color in any website that deals with food.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><b>Use Green For Promoting Outdoor Products </b></li>
</ol>
<p class="western" style="text-align: justify;">Green is one of the most call-to-action colors. It creates an urge among visitors, thus forcing them to take a look at the website. Though most of the time, you will see the color being used in a website that sells eco-friendly products such as refurbished items or any products that are organic in nature. However, one can also use it intelligently as this can be used creatively. For instance, if you have an e-commerce website, then you can use the color in the call-to-action buttons such as ‘Add to Cart’ or ‘Submit’</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><b>Black Spells Luxury</b></li>
</ol>
<p class="western" style="text-align: justify;">So, use the color to reflect opulence, royalty and add sophistication to the look of a product. What most of the customers look for in a website that offers high-end products is the sophistication that it can offer to them and no color is better than black, when it comes to describing the royalty associated with a product.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><b>Use White </b></li>
</ol>
<p class="western" style="text-align: justify;">This might sound to you a bit old school and traditional, but white is one of the most powerful design features. The use of white breathes life in a website. It indicates freedom and spaciousness at the same time. Hence, if you want to use this feature on your website, then do not hesitate to do so.</p>
<p class="western" style="text-align: justify;">There is a larger audience on the internet these days and millions of websites are coming up every now and then, with the right color strategy, one can definitely win over others. But, before giving a final say for any kind of device it is important to keep the target audience in mind, once you know the audience, then you can make the final move and make your website colorful like a painter who portrays a beautiful creation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Android era officially took a kickstart on September 2008, when the T-Mobile G1 launched in the Morocco. Android is the operating system of Google that powers more than billions of Smartphones and tablets. And it&#8217;s Google after all, so how can you keep away their sense of humor. As the Smartphones sweeten up the human life, they thought to add a pinch of sweet condiments by codenaming their versions after desserts, just as Intel names all their CPUs after Rivers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We thought to take you on a journey across the Android versions development down the ages in this seven years and see how big are the changes. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>Android apps development </strong></a>is taking huge leaps and developers are eager to fetch a new version every year to explore their crave to develop something new on the Android OS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take a ride of Android A to Android M’s journey with us in a visual manner and gulp the facts that made Smartphones add sweetness in the life of human thus making them grow smarter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Check out some of the cool features, which Android integrated down the years and made their version sweeter than the previous.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Android A and B</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android started their journey with <b>Alpha</b> and <b>Beta</b> versions (may or may not be codenamed as Apple Pie and Banana Bread). Based on the Linux kernel was put in use by the Open Handset Alliance, who started working on Android OS. HTC Dream or T-Mobile G1 was the first phone maker to get a real consumer phone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, after that they have a bug fixing and released the second version called Beta in February 2009, where they changed the Android API.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cupcake</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Technically, Android got into dessert codenames from the cupcake. The version Android 1.5 had some major upgrades with the integrated third-party keyboard, Widgets, and the phone could upload directly to YouTube and Picasa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Donut</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Version 1.6 released in September 2009 fixed the reboot errors in the OS, revamped photo and video features (i.e. camera interface) and featured better search integration. Even it’s seen to support larger screen sizes and the first version offered Google&#8217;s turn-by-turn navigation feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Éclair</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android 2.0 that had an official release in October 2009, with a bug fix version (2.0.1) December 2009 and 2.1 versions was out by January 2010. They have added features such as Bluetooth 2.1 support, flash and digital zoom for the camera, multi-touch support, live wallpapers, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Froyo</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android 2.2 mainly improved speed adopting the JavaScript &#8220;just-in-time&#8221; compiler engine from Google Chrome. It improved browser support by adding animated GIF support and Flash 10.1 plug-in support, along with USB tethering and Wi-Fi Hotspot capability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gingerbread</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Officially released in December 2010 and the first phone to get Android OS 2.3 Gingerbread was Nexus S, which Google co-developed with Samsung. Gingerbread supports SIP internet calling, NFC wireless transaction capability, multiple camera, gyroscopes and other sensors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Honeycomb</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It released in February 2011, rapidly followed by 3.1 and 3.2 updates in July and August of 2011 and was the first version to arrive on the tablets. They tried to ride the wave of the iPad&#8217;s success in time and Motorola Xoom was the first Android 3.X tablet to be released.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ice Cream Sandwich</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was an attempt from Google to synthesize Honeycomb, and it&#8217;s tablet-only platform, with its mobile platform. They featured a new design, default font, ability to monitor and limit mobile data usage etc. Samsung Galaxy Nexus had been released to run it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jelly Bean</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Android 4.3 came out in 2012 and the biggest changes were witnessed in Google’s now. It had many interactive notifications and allowed voice typing with a built-in speech-to-text engine that does not rely on Internet or data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>KitKat</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google announced Android 4.4 on September 3, 2013. KitKat&#8217;s parent company, Nestlé, was fully on board with the naming of operating system. KitKat improved ‘Google Now’ feature and took it a step further with &#8220;Ok Google” that allows people to access Google Now without even touching their phones. Just verbally saying the phrase opens up the artificial intelligence assistant. KitKat also introduced Emoji to Google&#8217;s keyboard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lollipop</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android L or 5.0 called Lollipop features a brand new runtime called ART that no longer relies on the older DALVIK runtime. Lollipop introduced the Material Design, a brand new user interface and has an excellent battery life on some devices under the codename, Project Volta.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Marshmallow</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android M or 6.0, the latest version got unveiled in Google I/O 2015 and for now it has advanced to Nexus&nbsp;5&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nexus&nbsp;6&nbsp;phones, the&nbsp;Nexus&nbsp;9&nbsp;tablet, and the&nbsp;Nexus Player&nbsp;set-top box. They have integrated fingerprint recognition to authenticate Play Store&nbsp;and&nbsp;Android Pay&nbsp;purchases and have yet more updated features, which we need to wait for the next purchase.</p>
<p>Join the Revolution in mobile with Android!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile health apps developers who make sure that their design blends a better user experience will yield the most success. So what the mobile health app developers of today must consider to ensure success? The solution to the app success is nothing other than usability engineering. Moreover, mobile apps today are showing increased sizes while synchronizing with small, wearable device such as Apple Watch that also use apps and have their set of usability challenges.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/" target="_blank">mobile app development services,</a> our developers have found that, usability engineering is something that they can call their cup of tea. Let us get ahead and know what makes us claim it as the most successful framework.</p>
<h3>What Do Mean By User Experience (UX)?</h3>
<p>According to the reports published in usability.gov, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/" target="_blank">User Experience</a> <em>“focuses on having a deep understanding of users, what they need, what they value, their abilities and their limitations. It also takes into account the business goals and objectives of the group managing the project. UX best practices improve the quality of the users’ interaction with the perceptions of your product and other related services.”</em></p>
<h3>Why is UX Important for Health IT Industry?</h3>
<p>Transition from paper medical records to EHRs has transformed how health information has a notable record, analysis and shared within the provider and payer community as well. For the most part, health consumers may not consider during design, development and testing these enterprise-wide systems. Transition of EHRs to mobile platforms will have a different experience as a health consumer’s access and share their health data on Smartphones and Tablets. Health consumers of today is an eminent part of base that you must consider as mobile health apps are some of the popular health apps on commercial marketplace.</p>
<p>The way users interact with mobile devices and apps have a profound way with how often we access data, which is one of the eminent factors to consider for the Health IT Community. For example, with the use of Smartphone users, “Pull to Refresh” to update the screen with the most updated information. However, these human factors changes when you interact with a Smart Watch or other wearable technologies. A vertical swipe scrolls the user to add extra information on the current screen while the horizontal swipe displays the previous or the upcoming screen.</p>

<p>As for content available, Health IT Data and Information which is usually dense and complex. The graphical presentation in such an instance is often the best approach to display. However, when does a graph on a Smartphone become usable to a physician, nurse, technician or even the health consumer?</p>
<p>There are several presentations at HIMSS15 Conference, which addresses a number of questions. From the perspective of technology, software engineers, designers, and usability experts to understand how the users want to interact with the device and information is critical and determines the overall user experience, acceptance and success of the app.</p>
<p>At Unified Infotech, software developers and designers are cognizant of their importance of the users interface and visualizing the content. When you need to “pull” and when to “swipe” are important decisions that we consider. Our creative team closely works with the software developers to create custom designed mobile applications. Moreover, the most preferred technology that we use is none other than “Usability Engineering.”</p>
<p>We have just started to take big leaps with our developers to make things big. We have cashed the new opportunities and helped those interested in transforming their Health IT services with human factors, usability, and design for both mobile and wearable devices. Consult or <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank">hire android app developer</a> from SCS INFO to change your health services with the human factors and enriched user interface.</p>

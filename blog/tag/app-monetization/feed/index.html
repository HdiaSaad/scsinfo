<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you developed the app because you felt like it would be the best way for you to reach out to your customers, or maybe you developed the app cause you felt like the market needed an app like yours, but that doesn’t mean you have to give it away for free.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before that, let’s validate the market presence of apps.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is Smartphone User Really Into Using a Lot of Apps?</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost half of the world’s internet population is using smartphones to access the internet. And the best thing about smartphones is the plethora of apps you can find in any app store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether for food delivery, groceries, cab service or simple social media, you can name anything, and there is probably an app for it. The rise in mobile app users in the last decade has been staggering and there is no reason you should not use that to your advantage and make some money with your app.</span></p>
<h3>So, how important is it to make your app stand out?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start using one of the many mobile app monetization strategy, make sure your app is one of the best ones out there. There are almost </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266210/number-of-available-applications-in-the-google-play-store/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.6 million apps on Google Play store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-many-apps-in-app-store-2000252" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.1 million apps on Apple store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this many apps available, there is a good enough chance that user won’t even give your app more than one glance. You need to make your app is interesting enough that they come back to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than one third of mobile app engagement last less than a minute</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Which means that initial one minute is all you have to convince the user that your app is the best one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how to make sure your app doesn’t fail? How are you going to develop an app that is loved by users everywhere? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to foolproof your mobile app monetization strategy?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to Know How to Monetize an App Successfully? First of All, Avoid these 6 Things Rightway </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most basic mobile app monetization strategies is to make your app successful. And everyone tells you about what you should do. But today, We’ll tell you what <strong>‘not to do’</strong>!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there are a number of reasons why </span><a href="https://reinvently.com/blog/top-3-harsh-reasons-why-mobile-apps-fail/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">67% of app developers fall below the app poverty line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So take a look at this if you want your app to succeed… </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Poor Market And Audience Research</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market and audience research is the backbone of monetizing your app. If you have not done enough research on the market and audience you are targeting with your app, then do it now. If you don’t understand the audience needs, then no matter what mobile app monetization strategy you apply, it won’t make you money.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Zero Originality Of The App Idea</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app store is full of different apps offering the same features. To make money with your app, you need originality. Consider your competition, and what features they are offering. Create a unique value proposition for your app, or there will be no money from it as it is one of the best ways to monetize your app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Ignoring Platform Requirements</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank">developing the app for Android</a> or <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/" target="_blank">iOS</a>, ignoring the platform requirements will not result in success for your app. Each platform has unique requirements that you need to meet to satisfy the users.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Bad User Experience</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a very basic way, your app needs to be easy to use for the users. If they struggle to search for something on your app, then there is no point of having the search function. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow or lagging app with long loading process is going to put off the user. Your app needs to give the user the best app experience.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Lack Of Proper Testing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of proper testing can become the downfall of an app. So don’t ignore the importance of testing your app to see if it is working properly. Doing this will eliminate major issues from your app.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Ill-executed App Launch</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sloppy app launch can lead the users to lose interest in your app. If you want them to love your app, plan exciting pre-launch activities for your app, such as email notification, advertisements. Execute them perfectly to hype up the users for your app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have considered all the factors important to make your app worth making money, it is time to find out which platform is going to help you achieve that goal.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">iOS or Android- Which Platform Is Going To Make More Money For You?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you have already decided on which platform you are going to design your app for. But if you have not, then you should read on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different platforms have different app requirements. And they can also make you a different amount of money. Choosing the right platform for your app is going to affect how much money you are going to earn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, developing an app for either Android or iOS is going to be a very different process. When you are thinking of how to make money from app, the choice of platform is going to make a difference. According to </span><a href="https://themanifest.com/mobile-apps/android-vs-ios-which-platform-build-your-app-first" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, iOS apps have better revenue generation rate than android apps.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8896" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-8896 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/world-map-ios-android-market-share-1.png" alt="mobile app monetization strategy comparison" width="800" height="531" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/world-map-ios-android-market-share-1.png 800w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/world-map-ios-android-market-share-1-300x199.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/world-map-ios-android-market-share-1-768x510.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8896" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://android.jlelse.eu/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the Google play store has more apps than the Apple app store, it is an iOS app that generates more revenue. Why? Well… </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android app users are less interested in paying for an app. So developing an app for Android means you will have to use in-app-advertisement to generate revenues. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iOS app users, on the other hand, will happily spend their money to buy your app if it is worth buying. They will also spend money on in-app purchases.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to make sure your app makes you money is to develop it for both platforms. Once you have launched your app on one platform and have it established, gear up to design it for another platform.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8981" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-lazy-man-guide-1.png" alt="how much does it cost to make an app cta" width="981" height="227" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-lazy-man-guide-1.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-lazy-man-guide-1-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/app-development-cost-lazy-man-guide-1-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way, you don’t have to choose between Android or iOS and reap the benefits of both platforms.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finalizing The Mobile App Monetization Strategy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know all the ways to make money with your app, you are probably thinking which way is best for you. Before you start planning about the monetization of your app, there are the last few things you need to consider.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Set Up The Value Proposition Of Your App</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value proposition of your app is something that outlines the benefits your users are going to get from the app. There are millions of apps in the app store, and you need to give the users a compelling reason to download your app, and not your competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, the value proposition of your app is incredibly important. Based on this, you are going to choose which mobile app monetization strategy will work for your app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how are you going to create your value proposition? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, think about what your user needs, and then consider how your app is going to help them. Make a clear and concise statement dedicated to your users, telling them how exactly the app is going to help them in their lives, the benefits they are going to receive from it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In brief, the value proposition of your app needs to tell the reader why they should invest in the app. Whichever mobile app monetization strategy you are using, if the value proposition of your app is not good, you won’t be able to make money with it.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Your App And It’s Unique Features</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are probably more than hundreds of apps out there similar to the one you are building. So why are users going to install your app, and not one of the others?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will you distinguish your apps in this harsh competition? Is there a way that you can make your user stick to your app?</span></p>
<h3><strong>Related Read: <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-build-habit-forming-technology-the-future-of-enterprise-app-development/" target="_blank">Secrets to Make Your App Habit Forming!</a></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is simple. To compete with the harsh competition, you need unique features on your app. In addition the basic features like the search option and social media sharing features, there need to be more unique features which are not available in any other competitor apps. Only then users would consider buying your app or paying for those unique features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you are <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/photo-sharing-apps/" target="_blank">developing a photo sharing app</a>, you can offer unique filters and photo editing features to your users. That way they won’t have to use another app to edit their photos before they post on your app. For a video streaming app, you can offer the users a vertical video player. Most of the time we have to turn out phone sideways to watch a video. But letting the users play videos horizontally without compromising the video quality or experience is going to make your app stand out among the competition.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Analyzing The Competition </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start working with any of the above-mentioned app monetization models, stop and think, what are your competitors doing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at any of the app similar to yours already in the market, and consider their choice of monetization technique, what unique feature they have and how are they using these features to make money? Is it befitting them? Or is it harming their business? Considering these details before you select a monetization model for your app will help you to make sure that your chances of making money are not harmed in any way. After all, the devil is in the details.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. The Growth Of Your App User Base</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are you going to keep increasing your user base? This is something that is going to affect the monetization of your app hugely. If your user base stops growing and becomes stagnant, no matter what kind of monetization technique you use, it’s not going to help you. You have to make sure the users keep using your app, and new users keep installing your app.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Related Read:<a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-build-habit-forming-technology-the-future-of-enterprise-app-development/" target="_blank"> ANSWERED: How to Make Your App Habit Forming!</a></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how are you going to do that? Through continuous app updates, introducing new features and offers in every update is the easiest way for you to get new users while retaining the old users as well.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s Your App Monetization Strategy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now after reading the entire article, you are definitely thinking which mobile app monetization strategy is best for your app? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, you are not really oath-bound to anyone that you only have to work with one model. You can and should mix and match more than one of these monetization strategies to make more money with your app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before that, pay attention to tiny details like app store presentation. People decide whether they want to install an app or not at the very first glance of it on the app store. Design a unique icon, and title, have a clear description and instantly get installed by the users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the most important thing for you to monetize your app is to be flexible about it.

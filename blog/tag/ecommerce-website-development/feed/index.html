										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As per a report by Boston Consulting Group, ecommerce sales will reach $50-55 billion by 2021. It also predicts that the digital influence on consumers will also increase. There are two reasons for the rise in demand. The drop in Smartphone prices and lower data charges. But what’s in store beyond 2017? Will ecommerce move to an advanced level or will it perish with time? <strong><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/" target="_blank">Ecommerce website development</a></strong> companies need to be aware about any such changes. They need to update themselves to adopt with any technological disruption.</p>

The work of delivery agents will become easier with drones. The concept of same day delivery will reduce to few hours. Technology will amalgamate with ecommerce to offer the best product delivery experience. Hence, online shopping will garner more attention of the global audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Droids To Ease Ground Delivery</strong></p>

Many major retail companies will enjoy this. They can save 30% transport costs. An ecommerce website development company suggests such measures. For instance: pizza delivery will become faster than ever before.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Technology influences ecommerce in many ways. Let us see how that’s done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Apps Change Consumer-Retailer Relationship</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile apps have changed the way we look at online shopping. The concept of visiting a brick and mortar store is traditional now.

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Engaging Strategies Which Will Bring More Sales</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, here are some engaging strategies which will increase your ecommerce sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Increase Short Term Email List</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep on sending emails throughout the year. Even if you didn’t send much mails, then relax. Your primary focus should be to collect more leads through emails. Remember, once you get good subscribers, half of the work is over. But, your target must be to get subscribers in the short term. Don’t show up to people as soon as they enter the website. Wait for few seconds. You can then start the interaction with the chat pop up. A/B Testing can be a better way to test the impact of your emails.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Make A Last Minute Package</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some late birds never realize that good deals are around the corner. A last minute package is a wonderful strategy. Send them an email few days before Valentine’s Day. Create the last minute rush to increase the possibilities of getting orders. If you are sending out last minute emails, remember that the delivery should be on time. Apply the similar strategy, even when you are applying for an early bird discount offer. Ecommerce website development company recommend such strategies often for an online retailer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Run A Flash Sale</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leverage the power of flash sales for instant orders. Announce about limited stock availability. This will create urgency among customers. For instance: a Valentine’s Day midnight sale is a great idea. It will ensure that people start purchasing more in quantity. Use promo codes and give huge discounts on the items. This is the best chance to get rid of unwanted stocks, so use it in the best possible manner. It’s an opportunity to get more revenue from your email list. Don’t forget about existing customers. You can also send an email to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Create A Valentine Mobile App</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are willing to tap a large market, then develop a mobile app. Be sure that you have the adequate financial resource with yourself. Send love theme cards to your customers or a voucher. You can also ask for a subscription to your newsletters. With this, you solve dual purpose. You are making your customers happy and end up selling more. A mobile app is more viable when it comes to spreading the word about your online store.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Go For Gender Based Showcase</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from making a romantic theme based website, there is another factor. Searching products can be a complicated thing. The solution is to differentiate between genders. For instance: you can include the sections ‘Gifts for him’ and ‘Gifts for her’. This will make the buying process easier. Customer can arrive at the purchasing decision without taking much time. Apart from that, you can also keep other sections such as ‘For baby’ or ‘For parents.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Wrap Up!</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As per a research by eMarketer, ecommerce sales figure will touch $27 trillion by 2020. Retail ecommerce is something, which has grown by leaps and bounds since the last few years. People are moving more towards personalizing their shopping experience. Something which is available only in online shopping. An <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/" target="_blank">ecommerce website development</a> company’s task is to optimize a website. It brings better results by giving the perfect return on investment to a person. Increasing the conversion rate should be the primary agenda.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Store Optimization &#8211; Its Necessity In Ecommerce Industry</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">About 12% of users look for new apps daily according to Google Play. App Store Optimization is a necessity in today’s digitally evolving world. Making an app is not the only thing for an app developer. In fact, discovering it amidst millions of other apps is the primary objective. Today, there are various ways to discover an app. Either you will browse in an app store, read a blog post about it or find it on a social network. However, instead of going through these options, you can go for one simple process. Here, comes the role of app store optimization. It’s the best way to get all the traffic to your ecommerce app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many direct benefits, which store optimization offers to the ecommerce website. The first one is the increased traffic. Use relevant keywords and meta descriptions. Make the website appear more prominently in the search engine. With optimized tags and descriptions, the traffic also increases. Ecommerce store optimization is a cost effective technique. You can generate more than 61% leads with ecommerce optimization. It’s a good marketing strategy to reduce costs. An ecommerce website development company look for such strategies. In addition to this, proper optimization increases brand awareness. It will increase your possibility of getting more business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This year online ecommerce retailers witnessed a phenomenal growth. As per emarketer, the sales will reach to an approximate $27 trillion by 2020. The ever-expanding ecommerce market is a proof of people’s obsession for online shopping. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/">Ecommerce website development</a> is forming a significant part to improve website conversions. Many new entrepreneurs fail to realize that apart from web presence, conversions also matter. We are moving towards the digital era. A consumer-based approach will bring us closer to the target audience.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Creating An Engaging Ecommerce Website</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without engagement, nothing succeeds in the ecommerce domain. Online shopping is an inherent part in everybody’s life. People rarely have the time to visit a brick and mortar store. This is the reason all online shopping websites are going mobile.  People are now looking for a more personalized experience. Instore shopping has replaced with online shopping. Many websites are already prevailing in the market. A website with unique looks, attracts more visitors. An ecommerce website development company can offer the perfect solution. It can help to create a successful brand name of a business. The only way to do that is through a perfect user interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are multiple factors which appeals to a customer in an ecommerce website development. Personalization is one of them. Research suggests that customers like to have the same experience like a store. They also expect the same in-store shopping ambience. With better customer service, you can increase the customer experience. On the other hand, emotion plays a crucial role. For instance: creating wish lists is an interesting way to get the attention of the customers.  This helps them to get the exact products they are looking for. As a result, the marketer gets customers in the form of leads. Hence, emotional driven shopping is the primary thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another factor is the presence in social media. Relying too much on social networks might not work every time. Retailers need to understand one thing. There is a difference between impulse buying and social media platforms. Mere presence on social media doesn’t guarantee success. Promotional content and increasing followers won’t materialize. If there are no conversions, all the effort goes in vain. Hence, an ecommerce website development company should focus more on creating the ultimate experience. Devote ample time and resources, if you want to generate more revenue through customers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>5 Guaranteed Ways To Improve Conversions</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the New Year descends, it is time to focus more on the functionality of the website. We suggest five fascinating ways to improve your ecommerce conversions in 2017.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Proper Brand Messaging</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To connect customers at an emotional level, it is important to convey a proper brand message. Always put the core value on the home page. It must assure the visitors that they have arrived at the right place. Free shipping is another important feature. Your website visitors must know about the shipping costs. Seek the feedback of the customers. Ask them what issues do they face while checking out. For instance: you can show your customers the actual color of the product.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Evaluate Site Performance</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two important factors to consider here – mobile aesthetics and mobile performance. The users of your website should not struggle with the web page when it comes to mobile. All the content should align vertically and ensure the best browser experience. Speed of a web page also matters a lot. It should not take too long for the web page to open in mobile. Information must not miss in desktop or mobile. 73.9% leave the website if the site is slow. As an ecommerce website development company, one must keep this in mind.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Seamless Website Navigation</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t make users struggle with navigation. Make it as smooth as possible. You can either opt for mega menus or for breadcrumbs. Mega menus enable users to locate the products with categories and sub categories. On the other hand, breadcrumbs prevent the user from going to the back menu. Users don’t have to return back to the user multiple times to go back to his or her previous search. It facilitates the user interface of a website. At the same time, it makes the visitor stay long on the website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Optimized Product Page</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the most important part of your website. It’s the product page through which your customers get to know the products. The page must answer the questions of your customers. Use high quality photograph to help your users get an actual view of the product. The best thing is to include product videos. This will give your users a live demonstration of the product he or she is about to purchase. Videos are quite helpful in making the right purchasing decision.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Smooth Checkout Process</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the most fundamental parts in ecommerce. The moment the customers arrive at the ‘Add to cart’ page, they should get a full view of the purchased items. Suggest visual cues to the customers to let them know the navigation path. Make the whole checkout process simple. Prevent your customers from leaving the website through a detailed checkout process. Remember, that emailers can be an interesting way to get back customers to the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Conversions always play an important role in an ecommerce website. In 2017, the competition will get more tough. There are plenty of ecommerce players already existing in the market. These five important tips will help you to get the best leads. You will stay ahead of the competitors and give a fresh new start to your business.</p>

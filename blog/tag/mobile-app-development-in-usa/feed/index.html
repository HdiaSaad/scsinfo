										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The mobile application testing environment in today’s digital world has occupied a pivotal position especially in a situation where iOS, android, and windows have covered the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank">mobile app development in USA</a>. In such as scenario, QA or the role of Quality Analyst is one area where companies are spending maximum money for delivering a robustly tested mobile application to the client. Automation Testing serves as an instant solution to test the functionality of the app. Not only this, it just gives the perfect solution for making complicated mobile applications.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Mobile Automation – Why we need it?</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An automation testing is similar to any strategic plan, which a company applies to get better output and the best results. Though it fetches good results, but unfortunately, the challenges pose as a restraint to most of the developers. This is the reason why most of the organizations are now going for open tool sources. Not only this, vendors are even searching for cloud opportunities now in order to find a more suitable way that can eliminate the challenges related to mobile automation. One thing, which companies should keep in mind, is that mobile automation is not something that to take lightly; rather it is one of essential elements, which a developer should take care of.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to mobile app development in USA, with perfect mobile automation, developers are still myopic about the industry trends and the real benefits it offers. In fact, there are a number of things, which a company must look into. Automaton is not something, which will ultimately amalgamate with business channels and evolve to create a completely new framework. Hence, companies should look for opportunities to mix mobile, web and desktop testing in a singular strategy and make use of the best tools available to them. QA or Quality Analysis is another factor to consider here. Mobile app development teams must look for ways to improve the overall quality of the application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another factor, which a company must look into, is that interdependency between the development process and quality assurance. Companies should stop looking into code intrusive tools and instead focus on interdependencies. It plays an important role as it ensures just the flawless mobile application testing. Well, talking about the automation, there are currently some challenges, which a tester has to face during the final stages of testing. As a leading company, which deals with mobile app development in USA, we will share with you on overcoming the most common challenges in automation testing along with their solutions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Overcoming Challenges In Automation</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now it’s time to bring forth to you some of the most common faced by the developers with a solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Challenge 1: Automation Testing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The proofs of concept take more time and don’t close down so easily. As a result, automation doesn’t produce the desired result as compared to manual testing. It takes more time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Our Solution</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Calculate the cost before you start automation. Measure the deviations of estimated and actual efforts. This will help you to identify the gray areas, whether it is due to lack of automation skills or improper selection tools. While estimating the cost of the project, keep various factors in mind such as script preparation effort, defects logging efforts, environmental setup and setting up the application for design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Challenge 2: Setting Up the Automation Tool</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The presence of a plethora of tools makes it very difficult for a developer to decide which the best one to choose is. In addition to this, the presence of multiple architectures complicates things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Our Solution</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make a specific task during the project in order to evaluate and select the POC. Selection of tool is very important. While choosing the project, do consider various mobile OS such as iOS, android, and hybrid. Don’t take those tools which require a programming interface for modifying scripts. It is necessary to make changes in reporting. A tool that works on both stimulators and devices is the best one to go for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Challenge 3: Locating UI Elements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the time it is seen that automation tool fails to find the location of the UI elements as the presence of numerous elements finds too many elements with the same identification. The tool cannot find specific elements in a particular page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Our Solution</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a company that deals in mobile app development in USA avoid using an automation tool, which doesn’t support UI elements. It is an intensive task as the costs involved with it are expensive. If you are developing a hybrid or Android application then use UIAutomator. In case you are developing iOS, them use tools like locators like ObjectSpy and Appium.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Challenge 4: Testing Dependencies</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scripting becomes difficult at times as knowledge of API is primary along with the right programming skills. On the other hand, Dependency Testing requires recording and requires the developers to export to other languages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Our Solution</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Always use API based framework for looping and parameterization. Use looping even if it still doesn’t offer support. This will reduce the length of the script and make a developer easier to understand. One can also change script data without making any necessary changes in the script itself. Another best practice is to use a multi-tier approach, which suits the application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Challenge 5: Reporting And Integration</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you do not have any planned continuous integration, it will have a negative effect on the project. You will face an issue with the delivery date of the client. To get the integration keep working, it is necessary to fine-tune it. For each project and application, you need a separate pipeline set up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Our Solution</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Plan it before executing the project. Make automated builds, set the duration of the automated test run and create a notification for each one of them. Take advantage of the ICIP (Continuous Integration Platform) which hosts standard tool sets. Always remember that you should never re-insert your USB during an automation run.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get that perfect mobile application, it is mandatory to make use of automation testing tools in a proper way by companies involved in mobile app development in USA. Various factors such as environment set up, location elements, UI settings, ensure on time delivery of a project which helps a company to earn a great reputation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">So, if you have been thinking that in your next project you are surely going to impress the client by delivering a bug-free mobile application, then you are wrong probably. It’s a myth that exists in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/" target="_blank">mobile app development in Casablanca</a>. There can never be a single application, which runs without any bugs. Small security problems, bad network connections, handling privacy settings and validating user inputs are some of the common problems, which arises while developing an app. However, with the right strategy, one can easily overcome them to ensure a less bug-free mobile application.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Security Issues In Mobile App Development</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Numerous studies related to mobile application bugs reveal that software bugs support 40% of failures, whereas 60% of them are security issues in an app. Hence, improving the security of an app is the primary way to enhance the reliability of a mobile app. To immune an app from getting vulnerable to virus attacks or any kind of security breach, developers use many tools and imply technology to deliver the best mobile app development in USA. Testing plays an important role here. A properly tested app is a guarantee of a robust product. It creates faith and trust in a client, as he gets an assurity of a quality product.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Identifying architectural flaws and other security weak spots are simultaneous tasks in mobile app development. This starts from the beginning stages of testing to avoid the humongous process of retesting while sending the final application to the client. As a developer, the task not only lies in debugging the issues but also ensures that no third party gets access to sensitive user information. To leave no room for errors, sometimes developers use code from other developers. Though this practice is not illegal, but one should always use the code depending upon the app’s requirements. In a nutshell, reading the code carefully before writing it, is necessary from a developer’s end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Coming to mobile app security, there are three critical problems, which a developer has to solve – making a device risk free, prevent sensitive data leakage and restriction of risk related transactions. A risk-free device may be susceptible to risk at the time when it allows an app to access all the personal details of a user. As a developer, one can set limits to it and allow only some selected apps to do it. Coming to data leakage, businesses may fall prey to sensitive data leakage. Here, an option for cloud storage would act as the ultimate security measure.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Ensuring A Bug-Free Mobile App Development</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As discussed in the beginning of this blog that ensuring a completely bug-free mobile app is not possible. However, as a developer, one can take steps that minimum bugs remain from his end. As a leading firm for mobile app development in USA, we’re here to guide you through the mobile app development process that ensures fewer bugs from the developer’s side.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do Code Reviews &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reviewing a code from another or a group of developers brings out many fallacies. If you skip something in the middle, another technical person can catch it quickly. Many companies depend on pair programming. Here, two developers write a code simultaneously. The use of code reviews is immensely important in those apps where the role of security related code comes to usage. Hence, advanced coding facilitates in leaving fewer bugs in an app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Go For Beta Tests &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Releasing the beta version is the most common way of testing the acceptance of your mobile apps by the end user. The benefit is that you can test the application again and again to find more relevant bugs. Users might find issues with different versions of operating systems installed in their systems. Hence, this eases the work of developer for finding bugs. Just make sure that your app has all the functionalities before you give it for the final testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rely On Automated Tests &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Want to test application programming interfaces, user interfaces and application modules? automated tests are the perfect ones to go for. It is not necessary for you to be a good tester to make the best use of automated tests. In fact, you can take the help of unit testing for developing the important parts of the application. Plenty of unit testing frameworks is available which one can make use of.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Handling Error Reports &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before you sit down to resolve the issues, determine the kind of problems your users are experiencing. If you have an application, which runs on the trial version, then remember that users won’t get in touch with you. Use automated error and reporting techniques in order to make the process of testing easier. While preparing error reports, one should identify the problem, include log files and version numbers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employ Dedicated Testers &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quality assurance is an important thing in mobile app development in USA. You must have numerous testers particularly dedicated for a single project. Sometimes, applications are too complicated and require the competency of experienced testers. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to financially support testers. In such a situation, one develops can test each other’s code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Virtual Machines &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make a robust application requires you to test it on numerous operating systems and various environments. Apart from testing the application, you will get a plenty of time to test it in various virtual machines. For various operating systems, it is good to make images of standard sizes, test them and then finally upload them on the server. Whenever you want to test, you can use the base images without even installing the OS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Good Debugger &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Various web app development platforms such as Python, Ruby and PHP make it difficult to debug. So, an IDE like Visual Studio will give you the best strategy. With a good debugger, you can neutralize the risk of development. No need to identify or solve bugs, changing code parts and a few print statements will do that easily.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap Up</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Making a mobile application completely bug free is like shooting an arrow at an unidentified object. There will be some issues anywhere or the other. However, as a developer, one can always reduce the number of bugs to bring more stability in the mobile app development in USA.</p>

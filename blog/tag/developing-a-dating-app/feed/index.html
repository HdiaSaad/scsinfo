										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">The fast-paced everyday life of the global population is dominated by technology. Every individual needs to do so much in a day that there is barely enough time for everything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">Hence technology acts as a boon in the modern lifestyle of today’s world. The Internet has served as an effective mechanism in this development. Coupled with Smartphones, it brings the entire world within a 6-inch screen and at the fingertips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">Right from shopping to paying bills, connecting with family members, banking, searching, entertainment and much more. The list is endless. The basic driving force for this trend is convenience. After busy working hours and other responsibilities, an individual runs short in time and energy to physically perform everyday mundane tasks. Online space gives them the opportunity to do so at home’s comfort or on the go. This behavioral aspect is prominent in the case of interpersonal communications as well.</span></p>

<p>The application shows the most relevant match profile based on the information provided by the user. From the list of suitable matches, the user can send a chat request to the desired person for further communications. There is a cool feature wherein the user can swipe right to send a connection request to another user or swipe left to ignore. Within the suitable match list, the user can view the profile picture of another user as well. It also displays the number of people liking that picture.</p>

<h3>Location Based Search</h3>
<p><img class="rightAlign-img" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Location-Based-Search.gif" alt="Location Based Search" /></p>
<p>This is an interesting feature added to our dating apps. There is a location-based search option in the application. It shows other users of the app within a specific range. Additionally, one can also see the distance between himself and other users.</p>
<p>The location-based search option helps in matching profiles that are in close proximity.

</div>
<div class="blogDetail-dscText-content-row" style="overflow: hidden;">
<h3>Health Verification</h3>
<p>We understand in today’s world, health issues and security are a critical affair. Our application has a unique health condition verification pointer. One needs to upload and renew an AIDS-free health certificate at specific time intervals. Failing to do so results in profile cancellation and the user is blocked.</p>
<p>This segment can also feature additional health certificates. If the company wants to display additional details related to health, it can be done. Information like blood group, surgery history, and medical records can be added to the user profile. These can be also linked to the verification process. All in all, there is an opportunity for complete customization.</p>
<h2>Industry Scenario</h2>

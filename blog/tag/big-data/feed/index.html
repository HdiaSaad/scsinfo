										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this tech-savvy world, almost all of us are familiar with the terms like Big Data and AI. but do we know what they stand for?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, we have a vague idea. We know that Big Data stands for a huge amount of data sets that result from continuous corporate surveillance on us, and  AI stands for intelligent systems that can not only make decisions on their own but also have the power to take away jobs. But is this all there is to big data and AI?</span></p>
<p>Actually, no. there’s much more to big data and Artificial Intelligence than these concepts. The world of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence is vast, and it is not possible to completely understand that. However, that doesn’t mean we can not try.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s Start With A Little History</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will talk about the present and future landscape of AI and Big Data. But before that, we have to talk a little about their past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of data in industries like Agriculture has been around since the Mesopotamian age. It is undeniable that data has been used to improve various aspects of society throughout history. But those data, however, are not Big Data. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12183" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12183 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cray-Catalyst-big-data-supercomputer_llnl_credit_cray_small.jpg" alt="big data and ai" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cray-Catalyst-big-data-supercomputer_llnl_credit_cray_small.jpg 600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cray-Catalyst-big-data-supercomputer_llnl_credit_cray_small-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12183" class="wp-caption-text">Source: insights.dice.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term Big Data was </span><a href="https://datafloq.com/read/big-data-history/239"><span style="font-weight: 400;">used for the first time in 2005 by Roger Mougalas from O’Reilly Media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It purely denotes the huge amount of data collected by big companies daily. 2005 also happened to be the same year when Yahoo! developed Hadoop to index the world wide web. As an open-sourced system, Hadoop is now used by different business organizations around the world to analyze huge amounts of data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI, on the other hand, is something entirely different than big data technologies. Big Data deals mostly with human users and their data. AI looks toward an automated machine system that can make decisions based on the available data. AI can be called a direct descendent of the Big Data trend, even though the concept of AI has been around longer. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12184" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12184 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alex-knight-2EJCSULRwC8-unsplash.jpg" alt="AI robot" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alex-knight-2EJCSULRwC8-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alex-knight-2EJCSULRwC8-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alex-knight-2EJCSULRwC8-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alex-knight-2EJCSULRwC8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12184" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Photo by Alex Knight on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term Artificial Intelligence was </span><a href="https://www.livescience.com/49007-history-of-artificial-intelligence.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first used in 1956, at a conference at Dartmouth College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The concept of automated inanimate objects that can perform tasks on their own has been around for a long time, and with Modern AI, that concept has come to reality. Whether we are talking about AI-based robots or cars, artificial intelligence is working smoothly to automate every part of our lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they differ from each other, there is a fundamental connection between the two. And to understand their future, we have to understand their symbiotic relationship at first.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Data And AI: The Relationship</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the fundamental workings of the two technologies, Big Data and AI can not be far apart. The first one deals with better handling of data, generating insights. And the second one uses that data to automate systems and make decisions without any external help. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12186" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12186" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12186 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sketch1502807165218-768x576-1.png" alt="big data and ai" width="768" height="576" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sketch1502807165218-768x576-1.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sketch1502807165218-768x576-1-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12186" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.optimumtelligence.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between AI and Big data is that of give and take. AI uses the data sets to get better at the decision-making process, while Big Data uses smart AI systems for better data analysis. Let’s look at how they are connected in a detailed manner.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. How AI Uses Big data?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Big Data analysis, systems were merely trained on a basis of variables and made simple decisions based on that. However, with big data analysis, things have gotten a little more advanced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The huge datasets that have been named Big data, simply contain too many variables to be analyzed and used in programming systems. And that’s why the smart AI systems are merely fed the data. These systems analyze the data, learn the patterns, and eventually get better trained at dealing with similar kinds of data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine an AI system that is being trained to recognize the prices of houses. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first step, the smart system will be fed with real estate Big data about various houses and their prices, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system will eventually discover a pattern within the data, and the various factors which make the house prices fluctuate.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on, the AI system will become an expert in determining house prices, thanks to the Big Data collected by a real estate company.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The function of AI depends on big data technologies. However, Big data depends heavily upon AI as well.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. How Big Data Is Benefitted By AI?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI helps in understanding as well as helping us to understand Big Data by providing proper insight into the pattern. It deals with the fundamental question we all have when it comes to Big data and that is, what to do with all the data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI helps in discovering new ways of understanding and discovering patterns within the huge amount of data sets. Earlier big organizations and data engineers used queries and MySQL to derive insights into the data, which happened to be an extremely laborious task. But with AI/ML in hand, it is not as laborious as it used to be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added to that there’s the matter of data quality. The huge amount of data that companies collect can not be used without sorting them out. Not all the variables can be used by them to make data-driven decisions, and that’s where AI comes in. It sorts out the variables, recognizing the ones that’ll be useful and discards the others, making a completely usable dataset that can help the companies to make better business decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now the combination of Big Data and AI is being used by numerous industries in various ways. From treating patients to quality control in a manufacturing line, there are simply way too many uses that are enriching the Big Data and Artificial intelligenceI landscape at present.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Data And AI: The Present Landscape</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you call it invasion or advancement, we can not ignore the various applications of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence throughout different industries. industry professionals consider the automation of industry workings to be the ultimate sign of modernization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to understand the present and future landscape of Big Data and AI is to understand the present uses of the technologies and the results we are deriving from that. Big Data and Artificial Intelligence have disrupted many different industries until now, and here are the top five among them. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Big Data And AI In Healthcare</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Healthcare system is flooded with a huge amount of data on a daily basis. And the only problem is that there is no set infrastructure that can make sense of this data and make use of it. And that’s why the use of big data and artificial intelligence in healthcare has become a necessary approach to improve upon the current healthcare industry.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12187" style="width: 441px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12187 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BD-in-Healthcare.jpeg" alt="big data" width="441" height="321" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BD-in-Healthcare.jpeg 441w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BD-in-Healthcare-300x218.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12187" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.simplilearn.com/</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, however, many healthcare organizations are using this data to better the kind of treatments provided to the patients. The data that is collected by healthcare organizations is not only being used in providing proper treatment to the patients but medical research as well as better diagnostic research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only artificial intelligence and big data in public health makes it easy for healthcare professionals to make better and data-driven decisions, it is also helping the patients to get more personalized healthcare services. Chatbots, medical apps, and wearables are only the foyer of the immense possibility AI has in the healthcare industry. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Big Data And AI: the Financial Magic</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are definitely many uses for big data in the banking and finance industry. But the most popular one is in the prevention of fraud and security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data is being used to analyze the spending habits of the customers and recognize the set patterns. Whenever there are any transactions conducted outside of the set pattern, it is flagged as a suspicious transaction and both the bank and client are notified about it. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12194" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12194" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12194 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nick-pampoukidis-t-UV1rZqPuY-unsplash-1024x685.jpg" alt="big data and AI" width="1024" height="685" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nick-pampoukidis-t-UV1rZqPuY-unsplash-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nick-pampoukidis-t-UV1rZqPuY-unsplash-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nick-pampoukidis-t-UV1rZqPuY-unsplash-768x514.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nick-pampoukidis-t-UV1rZqPuY-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12194" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Nick Pampoukidis on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early detection of fraudulent activities is definitely making the client&#8217;s bank experiences more secure than ever. Add to that the constant maintenance and upgradation of cyber-security systems in place, and banking experience has never been so secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one other major use of big data and AI in the finance sector we have to talk about and that is financial forecasting. Bigger organizations, as well as individual customers today, are using the big data and Artificial Intelligence-based forecasting software, that analyzes the financial data and provides advice on how to invest money and get the best results. This use of AI and big data is not only about improving the customer experience, but also about ensuring their steady financial growth. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Big Data And AI In Insurance Industry</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main challenge the insurance industry has faced till now is inadequate utilization of the available data. The data collected by insurance organizations all around the world can be used to provide personalized services, pricing and targeted services that can improve the experience of the client. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, insurance companies today are using big data analysis to analyze and detect patterns within the collected data so that they can provide better and more personalized services to the clients. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12189" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12189" style="width: 848px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12189 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/For-website-BLOG-1.png" alt="Big data and AI" width="848" height="500" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/For-website-BLOG-1.png 848w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/For-website-BLOG-1-300x177.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/For-website-BLOG-1-768x453.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12189" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.testingxperts.com/blog/5-Areas-in-the-Insurance-Industry-where-Big-Data-can-make-a-huge-Impact</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such a case, the analytics system is used to sort through the data and recognize the specific insurance-related requirements for the clients of different age segments. And then the AI system works is trained using the data, helping the client with more personalized service that fulfills their requirements.  According to </span><a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/07/big-data-insurance.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the client data is collected from two sources- the online behavior of the clients, and sensor data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the healthcare industry, there are still a lot of persisting problems in the insurance industry when it comes to the use of electronic data and artificial intelligence. However, according to </span><a href="https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/next-gen-technologies/heres-how-ai-is-helping-indian-insurance-industry-improve-customer-experience/74766974"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, insurance companies are using ai-based systems to improve upon their customer experience. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. eCommerce Industry: The Most Famous User For Big Data And AI</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, we are all familiar with how the ecommerce industry is using AI and big data to provide us with better customer support and ecommerce experience. The AI/ML based suggestion system can range from wondrous to downright creepy, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that it is not being useful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main impact of big data and AI in ecommerce will be that of customer satisfaction. Previously we had to search for a product every time we went to an online store. Now, using the machine learning methods, the store simply remembers our preferences and shows us the product upfront, reducing the need to search for it on the store. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12190" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12190" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12190 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/box.jpg" alt="Box" width="512" height="341" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/box.jpg 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/box-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12190" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Photo by Brandable Box on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data analysis also provided the online store owners with real-time data analysis that helps them to make better decisions that help the store to grow. The data on customer demographics, shopping patterns, and spending habits can be used to create a better shopping experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seamless shopping experience is only about to get better in the future as the big data analysis and AI technology improves. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Future Landscape Of Big Data And AI: Trends And Challenges</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have spoken about big data and artificial intelligence, what they are and how they are being used in the recent scenario, it is time to talk about future trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the experts, both big data analytics and AI technology are going to see exponential growth in the coming years. But what are some of the specific trends and challenges we will get to see? </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Data Volume Will Continue To Rise, Making Cloud Computing A Popular Option!</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.seagate.com/in/en/our-story/data-age-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">”Data Age 2025&#8243; report by IDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the global datasphere is going to reach 175 zettabyte by 2025. The main contributor to this large amount of data growth will be the increasing number of internet users all around the globe and the rise in the number of iot devices. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12191 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cloud-services-isometric-composition-with-big-cloud-computing-infrastructure-elements-connected-with-dashed-lines-vector-illustration_1284-30495.jpg" alt="Big data and AI" width="626" height="532" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cloud-services-isometric-composition-with-big-cloud-computing-infrastructure-elements-connected-with-dashed-lines-vector-illustration_1284-30495.jpg 626w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cloud-services-isometric-composition-with-big-cloud-computing-infrastructure-elements-connected-with-dashed-lines-vector-illustration_1284-30495-300x255.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, this large number of data will be impossible to store and manage, therefore making cloud storage and computation migration a necessity. Cloud computing services such as aws, microsoft azure, google cloud platforms have already made cloud storage and computing easier for the companies. And now they are only going to get more popular. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Machine Learning Is Going To Become More Important Than Ever.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you thought machine learning is being overused now, wait till you see its increased popularity in the future. With the increase in the collected data, it will encourage more companies to use machine learning to provide the users with machine learning based customer experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The improvements of the algorithm, on the other hand, will increase the abilities of the machine learning services. This will eventually lead to a higher level of personalization in any and all kinds of services, something we have yet to experience. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the challenge remains, and that is if the increasing abilities of the ai/ml systems will take away the jobs of millions of people around the world. The matter of AI automation is already under fire, and in the future, there might be more resistance against the subject of workforce automation. However, all we can do right now is wait and see how it all turns out. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Data Scientists And Chief Data Officers Are Going To Be In Demand!</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though these career prospects are comparatively new, they are also in demand. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shortage of professional data analysts and CDOs are being felt by most of the big corporations wanting to utilize big data and AI in their business ventures. And as a result, these professional posts are going to become even more popular in the near future. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Privacy &amp; Security Will Still Remain A Major Concern</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the data sets containing our data are being used for good till now, there are still some concerns about how it is going to be in the future. And you can expect these concerns to become bigger in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamentals of big data depend on the collection of data from various sources, whether it is from our online behavior, or from our iot based refrigerator. This process of data collection is what puts the practice of big data in serious question. The question of privacy in big data and AI has always been rampant, but in the future, it is going to become even more prominent concern for a large number of people.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The matter of big data and AI is definitely fascinating and frightening. Fascinating because it is opening up newer avenues in various industries that we have never even imagined yet.  But on the other hand, it is frightening cause we have no idea what these technologies are capable of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there&#8217;s no doubt that the popularity of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence is only going to increase in the future. And there are bigger chances that despite the challenges, it is going to introduce more breakthroughs in various industries and changing the way we interact with the world.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <b>Big Data</b> darling of today is none other than Hadoop. Making business savvy, and fits every need. It is an open source software project that enables distribution of processing large data set across a number of commodity servers. Hadoop is designed in a unique manner to scale the single server to thousands of machines with a high degree of fault tolerance.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on high-end hardware, the flexibility of the clusters with software’s ability helps to detect and handle failures in the application layer itself. You get a massive storage space for any type of data, huge processing power and ability to handle limitless co-existing tasks.<br />
Explore some interesting facts of Hadoop, how it facilitates and brightens up the future of various <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>web design services in Casablanca</strong></a>.</p>

<p><i>It’s just not the Big Daddies, but small to medium-sized companies can also use Hadoop for their business and boost their revenue. Do you want to know how Hadoop brought them success or how can you get successful with Hadoop, then read on…</i></p>
<p>Let us share a brief overview of Hadoop before we dig into the big possibilities it can bring for your company.</p>
<h4>HADOOP &#8211; STORY BEHIND THE CURTAINS</h4>
<p>The web has been growing since the late 1900s. Search indexes and engines came into being to help users locate relevant information amidst the huge text floating across the web. The growth of the web from dozens to millions of pages required automation. Web crawlers and some of the search engines started their journey in the meantime &#8211; such as <b>Yahoo, Alta-Vista</b> <i>(from July 2013 they have ceased all their operations)</i> etc.</p>
<p>Yet another project on open-source web search engine called <b>Nutch (brainchild of Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella).</b> They were after a way to return the web search results faster simply distributing the data across different computers to accomplish multiple tasks at a time. Google also came up with their search engine project based on the similar concept, simply sorting and processing the data in a distributed manner, and automating the way. In the year 2006, Cutting joined Yahoo and took along with him the Nutch project.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Hadoop </strong></a>is the framework and ecosystem of technologies managed and maintained by the non-profit <strong>Apache Software Foundation</strong> <i>(ASF, which is a global community of the software developers and contributors operating since 1999)</i></p>
<h4>BENEFITS OF HADOOP – HARD TO IGNORE</h4>
<p>With huge data volumes and space, stuff increased varieties of social media to Internet of Things (IoT), are some of the key considerations. However, some other benefits of Hadoop are–</p>
<p><b>Computing Power</b> &#8211; It helps to distribute the computing model and quickly process big data.</p>
<p><b>Flexible Service</b> &#8211; Compared to the conventional relational databases, you no longer need to pre-process the data before you store it. You can store as much as data you feel and take the decision later on how to use them.</p>
<p><b>Fault Tolerance</b> &#8211; If the node goes down, jobs automatically redirect to make sure the distributed computing does not fall short. It automatically starts storing multiple copies of a data.</p>
<p><b>Affordable Cost</b> &#8211; This open source framework is free and uses the commodity hardware to store huge quantities of data.</p>
<p><b>Scalable Operations</b> &#8211; You can easily grow the system simply adding more nodes and requires very little administration.</p>
<h4>HOW CAN HADOOP BRING SUCCESS TO YOUR BUSINESS?</h4>
<p>As per <strong>Forrester Research</strong>, 60% of organizations points towards the increased revenue, and improving their strategic role in business initiatives within next 12 months. That is why you need to give your business the touch of Hadoop.</p>
<p>Doing so will increase your likelihood and give importance to the desired area of your business. Subsequently, you will get a better chance to buy-in from across multiple stakeholders.</p>
<p>Since, not all organization is created equally and that in some circumstances the opportunity in business lies somewhere else. As stated above we mentioned about some key players in the business, but small to medium sized business can also use Hadoop for a number of benefits.</p>
<p><i>1.Hadoop can help you optimize customer interactions across channels thus maximizing revenue and creating best customer experience.</i></p>
<p><i>2.Hadoop will help you to streamline the business, assess product consumption in real time, and drive the most efficient business processes.</i></p>

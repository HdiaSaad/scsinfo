										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education is probably the most important thing we need. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have looked at the steps, it’s time to go through them to learn how to make a website like Udemy. So without much ado, let’s get started. </span></p>
<h2 id="Is_your_idea_worth_it"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Idea Validation &#8211; The Global Market View</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no secret that the rising demands for efficient and low-cost training and education system are driving up the demand for e-learning websites like Udemy, Khan Academy, Coursera, etc. but in order to actually validate your idea, we have to look at the numbers. According to the stats, the global e-learning market size is going to reach $300 billion US dollars by 2025. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11525" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11525" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11525 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/e-learning-market.png" alt="stats to create a website like Udemy " width="480" height="288" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/e-learning-market.png 480w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/e-learning-market-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11525" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Gminsights</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://elearningindustry.com/growth-of-the-elearning-market-gamut-size"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North America alone is going to constitute 40% of the entire 120 billion US dollar e-learning market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2025. Technology such as Artificial Intelligence, AR, VR, machine learning, big data, machine learning is helping with the growth of the e-learning market. As these technologies grow more, they will only help with the growth of the e-learning market. All these reasons make the idea to build e learning website a brilliant one. </span></p>
<h2 id="Learn_how_e-learning_websites_like_Udemy_work"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. How Websites Like Udemy work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the market is full of e-learning websites. These websites are not only featuring lessons and tutorials from the individuals but also from various institutions as well. However, before we start with the development, it is important that we look at how online training sites like Udemy works. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11532" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11532" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11532 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Udemy-website.png" alt="Udemy Website" width="825" height="359" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11532" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Udemy</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workings of e-learning platforms are pretty straightforward. The users simply sign up, create an account, and then they can start with searching for courses related to their field and interests and start learning. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Udemy, as a platform, approaches teachers and instructors, providing them with various tools to create and deliver content for their users. The rest of the marketing and distribution is handled by the Udemy team. You can approach this matter in the same way, or you can give the instructors freedom to sign up on your website as instructors and start creating courses. Now, let’s look at the business models available for these websites.</span></p>
<h2 id="Choosing_the_business_model"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Choosing the Business Model to Build e Learning Website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the business model is the first thing you need to get out of the way because this not only determines how you earn money through your platform but also your features. You also have to choose your LMS &#8211; if you want to choose a pre-built platform or create your own cloud-based LMS. Below we have talked about the probable business models for your e-learning website in detail. </span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Business model</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description </strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><b>1. Paid Certificates</b></strong></td>
<td>Besides the course costs, the users pay for a platform verified certificate that is accepted in various places.</p>
<p>Creating tie-ups with various universities and educational organizations and providing the learners with verified paid certificates will ensure that you have a continuous channel of revenue coming in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><b>2. Subscription-based</b></strong></td>
<td>With this model, the user buys paid subscriptions to the website on a monthly or yearly basis. Once they have bought a subscription, they can have unlimited access to the website and all its courses. This way the user will have to pay only a small amount of money to access all the information on the website.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><b>3. Affiliate Model</b></strong></td>
<td>In the affiliate model, the courses can have integrated links for various books or equipment that the users might need to progress in that course.</p>
<p>Once the user follows the link to the e-commerce platform and makes a purchase, your website will gain revenue from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><b>4. Corporate Collaboration</b></strong></td>
<td>The corporate collaboration model is where you collaborate with any business organization to have some specific courses related to their operation.</p>
<p>The organizations can train their employees in a centralized way. And not to mention, this will also earn you a lot of revenue for your website.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><b>5. Paid Courses</b></strong></td>
<td>Last but not least is the paid course model, through which your website can earn serious revenue.</p>
<p>When the students purchase a paid course part of the revenue goes to the instructor who uploaded the course, and the rest will go to the website owner.</td>
</tr>

<h2 id="The_core_features_to_implement">4. The Core Features To Implement</h2>
<p>The core features are going to determine the success of your eLearning website. Carefully choosing and implementing the right features to your website is of utmost importance. While figuring out how to create an online learning platform like Udemy, you will realize that you can divide the core features into three segments.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/about/contact/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12788 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5-1024x745.jpg" alt="speak with elearning project expert" width="1024" height="745" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5-1536x1117.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The first being the common features, the second being the student profile features and the third being the teacher profile feature.</p>
<h3>A. Common Features for Your Udemy like Website</h3>
<p>The common features are the features that anyone using the website will find useful. The common features are going to be used by both students and instructors on your platform.</p>
<h4>Account creation</h4>
<p>The account creation feature is going to help the users, both the students and instructors to create their own accounts on the website and personalize their experience on the platform. It is a must-have feature, as it would help the users to manage the various courses they join and upload, and help the students to learn without any problem.</p>
<h4>Profile management</h4>
<p>Profile management is the next important and common feature you need for online training sites like Udemy. The users who create a profile using the appropriate information would be enabled to use the profile management feature to manage those details, add or remove the courses, manage the certificates and follow instructors as well. Look for ways to build e learning website with seamless profile management.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11533" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11533 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/logout-login-udemy.jpg" alt="logout login udemy portal" width="750" height="495" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/logout-login-udemy.jpg 750w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/logout-login-udemy-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11533" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Udemy</figcaption></figure>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer support</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customer support, like any other service, is going to be extremely important for your website. The feature will help the users to contact the customer support whenever they are experiencing any kind of problem with the website, whether it is accessing their account or uploading a course. 24/7 customer support will increase the user-friendliness of your website. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business collaboration</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The online education websites like edX and Coursera have already benefited using this feature of business collaboration. Big companies and government organizations collaborate with online learning websites to introduce courses specific to that organization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way they can train their employees in a centralized way and track the progress data. Through the business collaboration, you would not only earn a generous revenue but also be able to work in collaboration. It is possible if you build e learning website with popular business organizations to help you to increase the popularity of your website.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Student profile features:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students, who are going to sign up to your website to learn, need various features to make their experience better. Here are a few of the important student profile features you will need. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search, Category, and filtering</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many courses available on the website, the students need a feature that will help them to sort out and find their desired course on the website. And for that they need a search, categorize and filtering feature. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11535" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11535 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/categories-in-udemy.png" alt="how to create a website like Udemy " width="800" height="467" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/categories-in-udemy.png 800w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/categories-in-udemy-300x175.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/categories-in-udemy-768x448.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11535" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Udemy</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search bar or the search feature will enable the users to look for a specific course using specific keywords. The category feature will sort out the courses in several categories based on subject, prices, certification type, expertise level, etc. through the filtering feature, the students can filter through the categories and find the right course for them. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recommendations</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recommendation feature will show the users relevant courses to the ones they have already enrolled for. This will help them to discover more courses that can help them to advance their skillset. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tag following Before You Build e learning Website</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tag system is also another part of discovering new course features. The students on your website for online courses similar to Udemy can follow tags relevant to their field and whenever there are new courses added with that tag, the students can see it on their homepage or recommendations page.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy payment options for enrollment</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are going to be some courses that will be a paid course. And to pay for these paid courses, the user would need a secure payment option.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11536" style="width: 850px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11536 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/payment-methods-in-udemy.png" alt="build e learning website like Udemy" width="850" height="552" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/payment-methods-in-udemy.png 850w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/payment-methods-in-udemy-300x195.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/payment-methods-in-udemy-768x499.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11536" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Udemy</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that the payment options integrating on your website are easy to handle, and most of all secure. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Instructor profile features</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make a functional website such as Coursera, you will need instructors who will upload new courses and content on a daily basis. And to do so, the instructors would need some important profile features. Here are two of the most important instructor profile feature you will need for eLearning website development. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11534" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11534 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/profile-settings-instructor.png" alt="profile setting to build e learning website" width="750" height="437" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/profile-settings-instructor.png 750w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/profile-settings-instructor-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11534" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Udemy</figcaption></figure>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Course creation and updates</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and most important feature is the course creation and updates feature. The instructor should be able to create a course based on their expertise and skills. Along with course creation comes the feature to update the course with new content. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
Dashboard (includes- courses updated list/revenue/performance/insights)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dashboard feature is necessary for instructors to keep track of the courses they have uploaded on the profile, the number of people who have enrolled for their courses, the amount of revenue that has been generated and an overall insight of all their activities on the website. </span></p>
<h2 id="Strategize_UI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. How To Strategize the UI/UX design</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UI/UX is going to determine the success of your website. The ease and efficiency with which the user can navigate the website will help them decide if they want to keep on joining courses. So </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When designing the UI/UX for your website comparable to Udemy, make sure to consider the below-mentioned points.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Simplicity And Consistency</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing you have to consider when designing a website like Udemy is the simplicity and consistency of the design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complex design, despite being attractive, does not do much when it comes to attracting users. The main visitors on your website are going to be students and instructors. And it would be efficient for them if the e learning design is simple. With simple navigational pointers along with easy to understand interface for the first-timers. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11537" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11537" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11537 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/learning-website-UI-UX-1024x576.jpg" alt="tips to build e learning website" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/learning-website-UI-UX-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/learning-website-UI-UX-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/learning-website-UI-UX-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/learning-website-UI-UX.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11537" class="wp-caption-text">eLearning website Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with simplicity comes the matter of consistency. The website design, with its colors, themes and logo need to be consistent to give the user a sense of continuity. This will evoke a sense of trust among the users when you create a website like Udemy. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. The Visual Design</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The visual design refers to the images, illustrations, and animations you will be using to make your website look unique, fun and interesting to the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it is essentially an educational website, i.e a website where users are coming for various skill training, it does not mean that the website has to be dull and boring. Through the use of colors and illustrations, you can make your website a fun and interesting one so that users want to visit every day. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11539" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11539" style="width: 982px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11539 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UI-UX.png" alt="designs to build e learning website like udemy" width="982" height="521" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UI-UX.png 982w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UI-UX-300x159.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UI-UX-768x407.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11539" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you have to be careful about using colors and illustrations. There are distinct principles about color psychology you should look into before choosing colors. When it comes to the matter of images, refrain from using stock images. While these stock images might be of high quality and easy to acquire, they also seem unreal and therefore prevent the site visitors from trusting your website completely. </span></p>

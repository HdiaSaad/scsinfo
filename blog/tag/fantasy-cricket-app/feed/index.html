<h4>6. Payment Mode</h4>



<p>Make sure to integrate all kinds of online payment options as well as credit and debit cards. The payment information the user enters should be secured. The easier and safer it is for the players to use the payment mode, the better will be the chances for your app to retain them.</p>



<h4>7. My Contest</h4>



<p>Under my contest section, the users can see the contests they have joined, edit their teams for each contest joined, see their current rankings.</p>

<h4>12. CMS Pages Management</h4>



<p>Last but not least, the admin should be able to manage the contents of the CMS page through this feature.</p>



<h2>Additional Features</h2>



<p>Besides the features mentioned above, you can also integrate some additional features during fantasy sports application development process-</p>



<h4>A. Live Match Score</h4>



<p>Besides the match highlights and expert opinions, integrating the live match scores is a great idea. With this, the players can keep track of their fantasy team’s performance based on the real-life performance of the cricket players.</p>



<h4>B. CRM Integration</h4>



<p>With this feature, the app is integrated with the back-end service provider and helps to manage tickets, push notifications, send emails and detect user locations.</p>

<h3>Fantasy Cricket Apps In India: The Legality Of It</h3>



<p>Before going ahead with the idea of creating similar apps like dream 11, you should back up a little and figure out the legality of it all.</p>



<p>When in 2017, <a href="https://cricketprediction.com/gambling/sc-rejects-appeal-to-initiate-legal-action/" target="_blank">a case against Dream11 was filed at Punjab and Haryana high court </a>under the Public Gambling Act, 1867, the single judge bench ruled that the game of fantasy cricket is a game of skill, therefore, it is not illegal in India. With that, the debate opened up that whether fantasy cricket apps should be legal in India or not.</p>



<p>The game of skill and the game of chance (a.k.a gambling) are two different things. In a game of skill, the player uses their own knowledge, skills, and expertise to play. In short, the player of a game of skill has a better chance of influencing the outcome of the game with their skills.</p>



<p>A game of chance, on the other hand, is a game where the player doesn’t have any chance of influencing the outcome of the game with their choices. In such games, luck dominates and determines the winners and losers.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>



<p>With that being said, while playing fantasy cricket, a player is purely depending on their expertise and knowledge of the cricket world and the cricket players. Which is why when the ruling of the High Court was taken to Indian Supreme Court, the SC dismissed the application.</p>



<p>This ruling has acted like the wind beneath the wings of the fantasy cricket industry. Now along with Dream11, there are many other fantasy cricket apps in the market that are feeding the cricket fanatics of this country.</p>



<p>But still, there are many people according to whom the apps like dream 11 for cricket operate in the regulatory grey area of the law. But this is the opinion of a few people. The ultimate consensus is that the fantasy cricket apps are legal, as long as the element if the skill is more dominant in the gameplay than the element of chance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This year online ecommerce retailers witnessed a phenomenal growth. As per emarketer, the sales will reach to an approximate $27 trillion by 2020. The ever-expanding ecommerce market is a proof of people’s obsession for online shopping. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/">Ecommerce website development</a> is forming a significant part to improve website conversions. Many new entrepreneurs fail to realize that apart from web presence, conversions also matter. We are moving towards the digital era. A consumer-based approach will bring us closer to the target audience.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Creating An Engaging Ecommerce Website</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without engagement, nothing succeeds in the ecommerce domain. Online shopping is an inherent part in everybody’s life. People rarely have the time to visit a brick and mortar store. This is the reason all online shopping websites are going mobile.  People are now looking for a more personalized experience. Instore shopping has replaced with online shopping. Many websites are already prevailing in the market. A website with unique looks, attracts more visitors. An ecommerce website development company can offer the perfect solution. It can help to create a successful brand name of a business. The only way to do that is through a perfect user interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are multiple factors which appeals to a customer in an ecommerce website development. Personalization is one of them. Research suggests that customers like to have the same experience like a store. They also expect the same in-store shopping ambience. With better customer service, you can increase the customer experience. On the other hand, emotion plays a crucial role. For instance: creating wish lists is an interesting way to get the attention of the customers.  This helps them to get the exact products they are looking for. As a result, the marketer gets customers in the form of leads. Hence, emotional driven shopping is the primary thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another factor is the presence in social media. Relying too much on social networks might not work every time. Retailers need to understand one thing. There is a difference between impulse buying and social media platforms. Mere presence on social media doesn’t guarantee success. Promotional content and increasing followers won’t materialize. If there are no conversions, all the effort goes in vain. Hence, an ecommerce website development company should focus more on creating the ultimate experience. Devote ample time and resources, if you want to generate more revenue through customers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>5 Guaranteed Ways To Improve Conversions</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the New Year descends, it is time to focus more on the functionality of the website. We suggest five fascinating ways to improve your ecommerce conversions in 2017.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Proper Brand Messaging</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To connect customers at an emotional level, it is important to convey a proper brand message. Always put the core value on the home page. It must assure the visitors that they have arrived at the right place. Free shipping is another important feature. Your website visitors must know about the shipping costs. Seek the feedback of the customers. Ask them what issues do they face while checking out. For instance: you can show your customers the actual color of the product.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Evaluate Site Performance</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two important factors to consider here – mobile aesthetics and mobile performance. The users of your website should not struggle with the web page when it comes to mobile. All the content should align vertically and ensure the best browser experience. Speed of a web page also matters a lot. It should not take too long for the web page to open in mobile. Information must not miss in desktop or mobile. 73.9% leave the website if the site is slow. As an ecommerce website development company, one must keep this in mind.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Seamless Website Navigation</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t make users struggle with navigation. Make it as smooth as possible. You can either opt for mega menus or for breadcrumbs. Mega menus enable users to locate the products with categories and sub categories. On the other hand, breadcrumbs prevent the user from going to the back menu. Users don’t have to return back to the user multiple times to go back to his or her previous search. It facilitates the user interface of a website. At the same time, it makes the visitor stay long on the website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Optimized Product Page</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the most important part of your website. It’s the product page through which your customers get to know the products. The page must answer the questions of your customers. Use high quality photograph to help your users get an actual view of the product. The best thing is to include product videos. This will give your users a live demonstration of the product he or she is about to purchase. Videos are quite helpful in making the right purchasing decision.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Smooth Checkout Process</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the most fundamental parts in ecommerce. The moment the customers arrive at the ‘Add to cart’ page, they should get a full view of the purchased items. Suggest visual cues to the customers to let them know the navigation path. Make the whole checkout process simple. Prevent your customers from leaving the website through a detailed checkout process. Remember, that emailers can be an interesting way to get back customers to the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Conversions always play an important role in an ecommerce website. In 2017, the competition will get more tough. There are plenty of ecommerce players already existing in the market. These five important tips will help you to get the best leads. You will stay ahead of the competitors and give a fresh new start to your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Santa Claus arrives every year riding his sledge. The ringing bells give an indication for the celebrations to begin. With another year at the onset, it’s time to celebrate Christmas again with zest. Many online retailers choose <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/" target="_blank">ecommerce website development services</a> at this time of the year. They do this to ensure the best management of their website. However, one critical area, which they ignore, is the security of their ecommerce website. It’s a critical area where a business man should focus especially on the eve of Christmas.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Necessity Of Security For A Website</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike the human brain, which needs occasional intervals, the internet works without a break. It works 24 hours and 365 days a year. Companies need to realize that there is an urgent need to prevent a website them from cyber attacks. Having a website seems to be a great thing from outside. However, one must take sufficient steps to ensure its security. Migrating a brick and store to an online venture involves plenty of risks. Every day the IT world falls victims to cyber threats with the breach in their web security. Christmas and Holidays are the time when retailers must increase their security.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Web servers of big companies have complex codes in them. Ecommerce website development companies help to eliminate security loopholes. These are still the concern of big data organizations. Many programming data on the website depends on the SQL commands and scripts. It depends on the execution strategies of the web server. Web security is an increasing cause of concern today. For information technology companies, data forms an important part. Hence, implementing the right strategies is the key. One must not compromise with websites when it comes to maintaining them. All the data stored here are fragile. They might fall prey to risk anytime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Website owners must keep in mind that systems with so many open ports always have risks. With various scripting languages and many services, this is bound to arise. However, with the correct machines configuration, the risks mitigate. With many frequent updates, it secures a web page more. Coding is another problem. With so many codes from various programmers, one is not sure of the effectiveness. A proper SSL certification ensures faith and confidence in your customers. Hence, when it comes to payment gateways many online retailers take its help. Running an ecommerce website is not an easy concern. Unless you ensure proper regulations, customers won’t come to your website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Our Tips To Keep Your Website Secure During Christmas</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One should not neglect the security of a website especially during Christmas. With orders pouring in from everywhere, the shopping carts are full with surplus items. This is the time, when retailers need to be extra cautious. There might be a case of security breach if one is not careful. Here are our tips to ensure safety to your website. An ecommerce website development company, must apply these strategies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 1: Avoid Any Unsuspicious Email</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep a close eye on the kind of emails you receive. Avoid those that ask you to include your name in any campaign. These are the ways to get vital business information regarding you and your business. Make your staff aware about such emails. Educate and aware them about any unsolicited emails.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 2: Go For The Strongest Password</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A stronger password is not the one, which is long, but the one, which is more complicated. Don’t use letters, use symbols. Letters are easier to predict. They are easy to predict, so keep them difficult to imagine. Recommend customers to use strong passwords. If your website, stores vital information such as order and invoice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 3: Store Customer’s Data Safely</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A payment gateway like Paypal, stores all the necessary information of customers. It includes credit card details, mailing address etc. It is your responsibility to make sure that your customer’s data is in safe hands. Keep a database of all customers with their relevant details. On the other hand, take care that you have a reliable web-hosting server.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 4: Create System Alerts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Same person might place multiple orders using different cards. There are many shopping carts, which have default settings in them. They can monitor many things such as track the person using the different card to purchase items. If you sell anything online, then know exactly about the way your shopping cart operates. As an ecommerce website development company, you must suggest the best practices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 5: Keep A Constant Eye On Website</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not possible to keep a continuous eye on your website. Analytics and automated tools can do this hassling task for you. They are like CCTV cameras for your website, which regularly monitors the traffic. A perfect overview of the website helps you to find out any irregular traffic coming to your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Tip 6: Have A Disaster Recovery Plan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While entering in an agreement with the hosting service provider, choose a disaster recovery plan. You must have a backup plan. Prevent your website from falling prey to an unauthorized access. Opt for the best recovery plan to get faith from customers. Security is a part of ecommerce website development service.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Wrap Up</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both Holiday and Christmas season are important festivals celebrated around the world. They play a crucial role for an online retailer. The only way to earn maximum profit is by getting the trust and faith of customers. Security is a primary area, which forms a part of ecommerce website development service.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In this growing era of digitization, it is imperative to have a website for any business venture whether it is online or is a traditional brick and mortar store. According to a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/" target="_blank">report</a>, the global e-commerce sales is going to rise to $1.5 trillion by 2018. Though creating a website comes as a more feasible option for entrepreneurs, but unfortunately, most of the entrepreneurs fall prey to the trap of the intense business competition that is prevailing in the online market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This happens due to some misconceptions, which they have in their mind and the lack of industry insights about <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/"><b>e-commerce web development</b></a>. Team Unified has got it’s hand on to some of the most common misconceptions that are surrounding e-commerce and what’s the stark reality behind them.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
<h2><b>Measuring Business With Revenue</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Stark Reality:</b> You need a strong financial backup that will not only manage your business finances, but will help you to pay off your employees, but also maintain the break-even point at the end of the financial year. Keep in mind that a lot of other important things matter in e-commerce websites such as click-through rates (CTRs), bounce rate and conversion rate. A strong eye over them will help you determine the amount of cash flows in business and will give you an idea of where your business stands.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li>
<h2><b>Charging Less Will Bring Customers</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Stark Reality:</b> Believe it or not but the consumer psychology of purchasing a low priced product will be there forever. You cannot attract customers to your online store by slashing down prices. What matters to a person when he or she is purchasing online is the popularity of the brand, the quality of customer service, the availability of the product in the retailer’s stock and the inventory management. Hence, before putting the price tag on your product, focus on the quality first and then put the amount.</p>

<h2><b>E-Commerce Platforms Are One And The Same</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Stark Reality:</b> Well, that’s completely untrue. The process of selling a musical instrument will be entirely different from an apparel website. The mechanisms on how these websites work are completely different from one another. While creating a website, it is important to understand the kind of product which you want to sell and then make the final move.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">

<h2><b>Live Site Generates Traffic</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Stark Reality:</b> This is the weirdest thought that one can ever have when it comes to e-commerce web development. The reality is that a website cannot generate traffic until and unless it’s product is marketed as a brand. Most of the big e-commerce websites today adopts techniques like PPC advertising, SEO, and SMM in order to drive more traffic to your e-commerce website.</p>

<h2><b>Can Succeed Online Without Prior Business Experience</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Stark Reality:</b> Now! That is the reason why most of the entrepreneurs quite as they come face to face with the bitter truth of life – setting an online business is equal to opening a brick and mortar store. It requires complete dedication and even more hard work when you are opening an online business. The reason is the growing competition in the market. A great strategy and an intelligent business plan are the key ingredients for an e-commerce business to survive.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li>
<h2><b>Design Is The Least Factor To Be Considered</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Stark Reality:</b> The simple truth behind this is that a customer will stay on your website once he is convinced after getting a feel for the overall look of the website. A lot depends on your website’s appearance on whether visitors will come or not. Hence, it is important to have a layout that is designed exactly according to the needs and expectations of your target audience. For instance: if you are selling luxurious products, then the use of high-quality images is mandatory.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li>
<h2><b>An E-Commerce Website Is Less Expensive To Run</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Stark Reality:</b> The primary purpose of creating an e-commerce website is to uplift the overall user-experience as far as shopping is concerned. Though it’s true that you might not be able to shell out money on brochures and newsletters like a traditional brick and mortar store, but a lot of work goes behind it, as well as money. Purchasing a domain name and maintaining the expenses of the man force involves a considerable amount of expenses. Hence, maintaining an e-commerce website definitely costs you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>What Are The Experts Saying….</b></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Neil Patel" href="https://neilpatel.com/" target="_blank"><b>Neil Patel</b></a></p>
<p>Neil Patel says that the users of an e-commerce are not really concerned about the homepage of your website, what drives them in are your product pages. For instance, one has to take care that the headlines on the homepage and the slider images are in perfect sync with each other. Mo</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overnight success in e-commerce business cannot be achieved overnight according to Seth Godin as he says, “It takes about six years of hard work to become an overnight success” and hence it is important to have patience when it comes to achieving good results in e-commerce in the long-term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A <a href="https://ww2.frost.com/news/press-releases/global-b2b-e-commerce-market-will-reach-67-trillion-usd-2020-finds-frost-sullivan/" target="_blank">study</a> conducted about the future of e-commerce suggests that the value of the e-commerce industry is going to increase to $6.7 trillion by 2020. However, another shocking revelation that the report makes is that retailers are going to face a tough challenge when it comes to implementing strategies in the B2B section as the prices, in this case, tend to vary in the high and low range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the good news is that with the development of technology, the process of procuring goods through Smartphones and Tablets will become easier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We globally connect with each other with the help of the internet and the apps embedded in it. From Hashtag in Twitter and Instagram set the trend, to a dozen Likes on Facebook or Pin in Pinterest are the digital mayfly that makes everything responsive at the right moment. Even, the eCommerce industry relies a lot upon them for networking their business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is typically a bad omen for business to stay disconnected to these social barometers. You should keep a track of them and accept those that relate to your industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An online retailer needs to keep a tab on what customers buy, how they buy and how they react to advertising. Ecommerce is on the rise and has grown in fame over the last few years. We have been witnessing these rising trends and at the forefront, as a role player, sits Amazon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, not every e-commerce business is big like Amazon, Flipkart, SnapDeal or eBay, but you can have the clear intention to adopt these basic trends and take advantage of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the upcoming years, a few big things are going to happen in the eCommerce industry and you need to dig in to make profits. Let us dig in a small and crisp study with <strong><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/" target="_blank">eCommerce website development company in India</a></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Programmatic Marketing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You have an ecommerce web design incorporated as per the analytics to drive ROI, but the layout and UI are the final touches to initiate successful marketing. But that&#8217;s not the end, and here what programmatic marketing is going to do with the use of superior data to display the ad to someone who might be interested in your product.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Programmatic marketing is all about showing the correct ads to the people at the right time. There is nothing as the basic retargeting and programmatic marketing,you stand to reach for the grand audience since the right people are not your current customers who have visited your website earlier. The customer who might not have visited your website ever probably may not know about your business until they see the advertisement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Marketing Automation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you hear the phrase, marketing automation you might think initially of the email marketing, but it is something beyond email, when it comes to ecommerce. Marketing automation empowers customized landing pages, promotions, email marketing, a contest and even the suggested products that you want your customers to have a look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This personalization and customization are fair enough to make noteworthy investment and limit themselves to large vendors. Many companies offer managed recommendation solutions that are open to many online retailers irrespective of their business size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mobile Awareness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an ecommerce web development company in India, we had been working with a number of clients who have developed their ecommerce store on a number of platforms with us. But as per our marketing department, all have taken to mobile commerce after the development of the website. Mobile access is growing at a faster pace; even Google has started to consider your mobile app presence in the search results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even our online vendors confirm that shopping done on mobile devices is great compared to the previous years. Therefore, we are successful in approaching our client to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/5-responsive-web-design-rules-for-better-mobile-experience/" target="_blank">design a fully responsive website</a>. It helps your website to function the same on mobile as well as on computers. Many may not have measured it, but having a standalone app may attract customers if you provide them with full access to your catalog.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Years ago, clients got restrictions over the choices and accepted the best effort from the online vendors. However, as the sum of money and time, they spend online has to reduce their effort. The customer has shown that they respond when treating true persons. The products suggested to them, promotions offered seem to be exclusively for them it makes them empower their shopping capabilities at your store. So make sure of all the possible devices to let them find the best at your store and boost your ROI.</p>

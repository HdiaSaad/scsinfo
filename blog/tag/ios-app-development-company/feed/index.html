										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017, developers have shifted their ways towards Swift while taking up the project of iOS or MacOS. If you are a startup and looking for iOS app development, then opting for Swift is probably the most crucial decision. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/apples-new-programming/">Apple introduced this fresh programming language</a> in 2014 that consist all the upper hand of C and Objective C. Swift is a powerful and spontaneous programming language for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. The recent updates show that Facebook, Mozilla, Uber, IBM, LinkedIn, and all giants have already turned their ways towards Swift. This very change leads the startups this way including the Silicon Valley measured as the fastest growing ones.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Backdrop of Swift Language</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Swift has been introduced in 2014 at WWDC and has replaced objective C effectively. It was declared as open source in 2015. Thereafter, IBM and Apple mutually started investing in it. This programming language supports iOS, OSX, tvOS, and watchOS. Let’s discuss the reasons why startups are heading towards Swift.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1.  Benefit of Open Source</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An open-source programming language makes the whole process immediately accessible and less costly for startup companies. Studies say open source software or language mutually help businesses to save $60 billion per year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Swift is available on Linux and the work is done to bring Swift to windows. Swift shows great potential and it is growing really fast with the support of the open-source community. Objective-C dominated the app market from 1980 to 2014 to develop native iOS apps. However, the era put to an end with the arrival of Swift.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2.  Utmost Security with Easy maintenance</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a newbie in the market security is the most crucial aspect when it comes to mobile application. You point of focus should be on approaching its security with a secure app. Moreover, it is a boon indeed if the app is easy to maintain. It is safer than Objective-C in a way to handle bugs and calls to safer apps. On the other hand, Swift is much easier to maintain not having any legacy code to deal with. Swift does not have any dependencies like Objective-C cannot evolve until C evolves. So, turning your ways towards swift give you dual benefits.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3.  Easier to Read as well as Write</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best aspect concerning Swift programming languages is that it drops rehearses like ending with semicolons or utilizing deviation to encompass restrictive expressions inside if/else statements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the language&#8217;s technique and function calls make utilization of the benchmark tradition of a comma-separated list of parameters. With lesser code, it causes you to get an indistinguishable outcome from per the syntax requirements. The outcomes will be clear, less complex, and more expressive language.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lucidness of this language has made it simple for software engineers from JavaScript, Java, Python, C++, and C# to embrace Swift into their tool chain.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4.  An Extremely Innovative Approach</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s true that the Swift is another language and it is the principle motivation behind why you should begin learning it at this moment. For the most part intended to make application development more intelligent and agreeable, Swift has made application development more available for each one of those, who are building up their own particular applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the motivation behind why Swift will be broadly used. We can consider this programming language without bounds. Along these lines, it is fitting for you to receive the rule – the more up to date – the better. You ought to be the one, who ventured into the future in the front row.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All things considered, it’s correct that some other development, Swift needs a few changes and learning. It is a decent choice that you make utilization of something that is well known; in any case, it is way better to be the one, who&#8217;s occupied with the procedure of upgrades and developments.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5.  Fat and Powerful Programming Language</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From its starting, the Swift programming language was primarily created to be the quick and considered as very powerful. The codes that are composed in this language are good with the most recent equipment and get most out of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The syntax structure and standard library of this language guarantee that the Swift codes work incredibly. In any case, the successor of Swift to the languages C and Objective-C, and it incorporates the primitives of programming like sorts, types, administrators, and the stream controls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides, the language likewise accompanies a portion of the acquired elements, containing classes, protocols, generic, and more from the object-oriented language. It conveys the Cocoa and the Cocoa Touch engineers the energy of programming that required to manufacture some capable quality applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is one such programming language, which is, for the most part, worked to be something way amazing when contrasted with its ancestors. Nonetheless, the language is still in its work-in-advance mode, yet you ought to embrace this top of the line language because of its new and unfamiliar potential that will make it less demanding to code.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">6.  Less Code Leads to Fewer Chances of Errors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As of now specified that Swift requires less code than other programming languages, the odds of mistakes will be less. As a useful programming language, Swift is exceptionally well known for supporting passing capacities as factors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this manner, you can grow exceedingly generic code that can do a ton of astounding things, diminishing redundancy and endeavors. Alongside this present, Swift&#8217;s expectable conduct when an invalid discretionary variable is utilized, this is the programming language that triggers a runtime crash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bang energizes up the bug-settling process on account of its predictable conduct and it strengths clients to settle the issue quickly. Henceforth, it will decrease the improvement time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Previously mentioned reasons will most likely make you prepared to embrace <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/">Swift for building iOS applications</a>. These reasons are sufficient for any iOS engineer to embrace this top of the line and intense programming language that makes improvement simple.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Apple has always taken the concept of design to another level higher, each time it has come out either with an upgraded operating system or a new device. Creating unique user experiences by offering them appealing designs has always been one of the key goals of this American multinational technology company. It’s the high quality design of the product that makes Apple a favourite gadget among people. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Companies that have been involved in iOS app development have to follow strict guidelines as far as UI/UX design is concerned. We have researched about the different rules that need to be followed while designing an iOS app and have concluded 6 tips that would help you to design the user interface of an iOS app quickly. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Tip 1: Manage Content With Proper Layouts and Visuals</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While working with the content, use larger items. It helps users to focus more and not get distracted by surroundings. Alignments make an app look organized and at the same time help user to scroll easily through the important information on a screen, which is full of clustered content. Moreover, every interactive element should have proper spacing to make it easier for people to interact. Hence, interactive visuals and layouts are one of the keys for a great UI/UX design in </span><a title="iOS 8 App Development Service" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>iOS app development</b></span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Interactive elements bring life to an app, so why not use it? Be it the color, location or icons, introducing interactivity will pique the interest of the users. For instance: using blue color in the app adds a unique appeal to an icon. A location map app with a blue icon for ‘Directions from here’ acts as a call-to-action button. On the other hand, app store makes use of button border in order to help the user make a clear distinction between purchasing the product and reading more about the same. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Tip 3: Legitimate Text Size For Clear View</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A great typography is one of the keys for a <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/" target="_blank">great UI/UX design</a>.

Other benefits of using this font are auto adjustments in letter spacing, specify different kinds of text styles and the availability of wide range of font sizes. You can download the San Francisco font from here.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Tip 4: Use High Resolution Pictures </b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Always use high-resolution pictures in the app or else images will appear blurry. To give you a brief idea about the measurements of the images and icons required in iOS app development.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Tip 5: Organize the Layout With Proper UI Kit</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The iOS UI kit offers four UI elements – Bars, content views, temporary views and controls. A UI view is well equipped with controls and control views. It can determine when to draw onscreen and can easily detect the touch points of the user. Use the view controller in order to co-ordinate the displays of the number of views and create the functionality behind user interaction. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Tip 6: Align Properly With The Text And Images </b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Consider the visual elements intelligently and then align them with the content. For instance: use of drop shadows and gradients can sometimes become heavier and interfere with the content. In order to overcome this problem, you should take care of the content instead and let UI take a backseat. Use negative spaces in order to make the app look more distinctive.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At WWDC, Apple surprised developers announcing their new programming language Swift to develop apps across Apple’s platforms.</p>
<p>To date it was Objective-C, the subsequent language used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" target="_blank">NeXT</a> (company founded by Steve Jobs) and then by Apple. However, in 2014 Objective-C finally had to face someone to supersede it with modern and safer features.</p>
<p><strong>How powerful is the new language? What changes can it introduce in the global community of Apple product developers?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>iOS SWIFT – A Small Introduction to the New Craze<br />
</strong><br />
Swift as we know is the new language from the house of Apple for iOS and OS X apps. Previously they used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_c" target="_blank">Objective-C</a>, but now Apple thought to turn safer with the launch of a spanking new programming language and add contemporary features that would make programming easier and flexible. A clean slate, mature Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks would be the perfect maneuver for software development.</p>
<p>Apple has been developing the language for a long time by making advancement in these areas –</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Making changes in the existing compiler, debugger, and framework infrastructure.</li>
<li>2. Apple developers have simplified the Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).</li>
<li>3. Changes in the framework stack, built on the solid base of Foundation and Cocoa by modernizing and standardizing the feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was Objective-C that has worked earlier on support blocks, collection literals, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/an-instant-guide-to-programming-languages-for-website-development/" target="_blank">allowing framework adoption of modern technologies in programming language</a> and adoption of various modules. Therefore, this groundwork has largely contributed to developing new programming language.<br />
Swift is friendly to developers as it is expressive and would not be a problem for the earlier Objective-C with Swift code and generate results immediately. It is better to say that Swift is a powerful combination of modern languages such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C#</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Python</a> with certain tweaks to make it more advanced and “swift”. It has optimized the compiler to perform, improved language for development, designed to scale from “hello, world” to the entire operating system.</p>
<p><strong>New Improved Features Making Swift a Game-Changer</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>Modernized</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Latest research shows that the new language from Apple retains the named parameters of Objective-C, but in a more clean syntax that makes APIs in Swift easy to maintain and read.<br />
var sortedStrings = sorted(stringArray) {<br />
$0.uppercaseString &lt; $1.uppercaseString<br />
}<br />
Inferred types help to make code clean and less prone to mistakes. Modules in turn help to remove the headers and provide namespaces. Memory manages automatically, and developers do not even need to put the semicolons.</p>
<p><strong>To make the codes more expressive Swift introduces some features:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Generics</li>
<li>Speedy, Accurate and Concise</li>
<li>Structures for Support Methods, Extensions And Protocols</li>
<li>Map and Filter as Functional Programming Patterns</li>
<li>Tuples and Multiple Return Values</li>
<li>Function Pointers Unifies Closure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Playgrounds</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Playground is a new feature that that makes coding fun with the use of Swift. As soon you type a line, and result would appear immediately. If your code runs over time through the loop, you can watch it in the timeline. The timeline would show the variables in a graph draw each step while constituting a view and can play an animated SpriteKit scene. As soon as the developers perfect their code in the playground, they must move the code to the project immediately.</p>
<p><strong>General uses of playgrounds lists:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>1.Watch results at every step of designing a new algorithm.</li>
<li>2.Launching new tests and verifying it before promoting to test suite.</li>
<li>3.Experimenting with new APIs by perfecting Swift coding skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Safe Design</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no chance to have unsafe code with Swift. Variables always initialized before use, arrays and integers, check the overflow and automatically manage the memory. Syntax here turned on to make the language easy and definable. Such as:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>(var) stands for Variable</li>
<li>(let) for constant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For activating powerful Cocoa and Cocoa Touch APIs, safe patterns in Swift been introduced. It enables proper understanding of the frameworks, addition of a single character helps to replace the entire line of code in Objective-C. This strives to build iOS and Mac app easier and safer than before.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>Powerful and Quick</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Swift, the name is self-explanatory. It is a fast programming language, with high-performance LLVM compiler and quickly transforms into native-optimized code to get productive results from a Mac, iPhone, and iPad hardware. Revision of syntax and standard code library to write code is going to help the apps to perform the best.</p>
<p>Developers at Apple consider Swift as the successor of C and Objective-C languages. It typically has similar characteristics of Objective-C such as types, flow control, and operators besides objected-oriented features such as classes, protocols, and generics to give a boost to the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch developers.</p>
<h2>A Little More from Our Desk</h2>
<p>Apple has taken a big step by introducing Swift. The developers who joined the event at WWDC in June 2014 accepted the language largely. However, the real test has commenced as developers have started to code their scripts using Swift. Now, we have to wait and watch that how long Swift keeps developers motivated.</p>
<p><em>Would they equally praise Swift as they did Objective-C?</em></p>
<p><em>What new possibilities they could come up with Swift? &#8212;&#8211; Everything is now a matter of time.</em><br />
<strong>If we are asked to judge, then we would like to suggest what Steve used to say,<br />
</strong>“<em><strong>I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next.</strong></em>”<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The collaboration of technology and business is something, which cannot be overlooked. Both of them have delivered results that have helped brands to grow larger and establish themselves as a premier marketing organization. There has been a huge shift in the digital world with the ongoing transformation that is taking place. Marketers these days are allocating a considerable portion of their budget behind web development. According to a research done by Gartner in 2015, it was found that marketers spend 61% of their budget. The figure is an indication of how important technology is to a company. Marketers these days are constantly figuring out ways and methods to move ahead of their competitors and technology is one of the ways.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Some significant problems faced by the companies such as bad website performance, data analytics and security can no longer be considered as an IT problem. They are now considered to be a part of the </span><a title="Web Design and Development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>web design and development</b></span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">. After an intensive research, team <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">Unified</a> has come up with the technologies, which you need to adopt today to ensure positive results for your business.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Frameworks</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">They are the foundation of a programming language that makes the process of writing programming languages easier. They help to eliminate the tough task of setting up a new web application. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We recommend you to use the following frameworks for your business</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">

<li><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-nodejs-developer/"><span style="font-size: medium;">Node.js</span></a></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Programming Language</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Without a programming language, it becomes impossible for the developer to work because this is the only mode of communication with the computers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We recommend you to use the following programming languages for your business</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Browser </b></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We recommend you to use the following browsers for your business</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Safari</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Google Chrome</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Firefox</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Databases</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Databases store all your important data of your company along with the applications. Starting at the record of employees to the information of accounts or fixed assets without a database your business cannot survive. Similarly even in a technology company, it is imperative to have advanced databases. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We recommend you to use the following databases for your business</span></p>

</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Libraries </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While writing complicated codes, libraries are something that proves to be of immense helpful. They ease the process of development as the developer doesn’t have to go through the tiring stage of writing code. We recommend you to use Underscore and jQuery in order to get optimum output.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Check out this wonderful video and learn how to set up a local coding workflow while developing web application</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>If you want to successfully implement these web development technologies then it is necessary to take some important things into consideration. These are mandatory things to follow if you want to implement the web development technologies in your organization.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Focus on Performance</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Loading time of a website is an important matter of consideration. It is true that a website which takes ten seconds to load is slow, but nowadays, it’s a completely different scenario. If a web page doesn’t open within 10 seconds, then visitors will leave your website and open a competitor’s website. The slow performance of a website not only hamper the reputation of a website, but it will also lure away traffic from the website and reduce their trust in your brand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Consider Privacy </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Proper investment in protecting the privacy of the company’s data should be top of the mind consideration for any business person. More and more websites are now switching over to https from http. There are many privacy invasive technologies like encryption, user-tracking protocols, site visitor tracking and much more that provides piracy, but if one doesn’t adopt suitable measure in protecting the technology, then there is no use in investing in technology. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Accessibility Mixed With Design</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Accessibility of a website is an important factor as there are some audiences with disabilities. Adopting unique designing techniques means creating a universal accessible solutions in terms of designing. Many businesses having their online presence have failed to capture the audience in the right way as they have not been successful to divide the audience in terms of demographics and other factors. Hence, it is important for the marketers to realize the need of using web development technologies when it comes to understanding digital marketing. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Security </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Data and content are two important things for a firm which are involved in delivering IT solutions. Sensitive data of the customers as well as of the firm can easily fall prey to a hack by the third party. In order to secure a website, it is necessary to protect the web application. Apart from this, one should regularly update the software or any other applications. Many large business organizations around the world have security analyst, who estimate the risk associated or the threats that a company’s data is vulnerable to. In today’s world, where frequent leaks are not unusual, it is necessary for a business to adopt correct security measures so that it doesn’t fall prey to the hand’s of the hackers. Privacy and compliance are the two main important factors, which you should always keep in mind if you have sensitive information in your database.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Web Development technologies have fastened the process of development for sure. It allows developers to solve a problem from a new perspective. The fundamental approach to web development should be followed by proper evaluation and improved security services. In this age of digitization, where every solution is solved online, these advanced web development technologies has opened the doors of development to the technological world. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Infinite opportunities have grown when it comes to web development. The doors of technology have opened the gates of development. With several options for customizations, Laravel has clearly emerged as one of the winners when it comes to developing a website. Most of the entrepreneurs today, prefer Laravel when it comes to selecting the best open source PHP web framework. It gives a boost when it comes to developing applications using the model view controller architectural pattern. Hence, it would not be wrong to say that it eases the process of <a title="web design and development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><b>web design and development</b></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether it is about using object-oriented libraries or the number of useful extensions, it has always given its fruits of benefits to all those who have used it, but did you ever wonder how does it ease the process of web development? Well, we present to you some of the important reasons that explain how this <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/uipl-will-let-you-know-how-to-choose-the-best-mv-framework/">MVC framework</a> acts as a catalyst in web development.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Easy Authentication </b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to implement authentication, then Laravel is the best choice for you. Each and every file is configured for you. It includes many well-documented options in the form of config/auth.php that helps to twist the performance of many authentication services. Moreover, it also enables you to completely customize the website according to your requirements. Being backed by a powerful tool like PHP, it has the ability to transform your business to a genius.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Makes Unit Testing Easier</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the key benefits of Laravel is that it while it runs unit tests, the configuration environment is automatically set to testing. Separate configuration files are created for cache and session. They tend to array the testing environment; which means that there will be no cache or session data while testing. One can create separate data in cache even while testing. In addition to this, there is a separate Testcase class to make the method of testing easier.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>ORM Models Simplify The Database</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an ActiveRecord implementation, the ORM models of Laravel create a great working environment in the database. You can find a separate ‘model’ in each of the databases that in turn helps you to enter new records in the table. In case, you do not find a model, you can use the primary key – App::error to display a 404 page. It allows you to specify the database connection while running a query on Eloquent.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Homestead For A Delightful Experience</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No need to install PHP, HHVM or any kind of web server, in your machine because Laravel Homestead comes loaded with Vagrant box that enables you to manage your operating system without any problem. The best part is that it runs on any type of operating system whether it is Mac, Linux or Windows. The inclusion of other frameworks such as MySQL, Node or Memcached allows you to develop awesome applications of Laravel.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Why Should You Prefer Laravel Over Other PHP Networks ?</b></i></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to a survey done by Sitepoint in 2015, Laravel emerged as one of the most popular frameworks in the workplace (see image below)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now let us study the reasons why Laravel is one of the most preferred ones when it comes to selecting the best framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laravel 4, the recent version has come up with a number of helpful features make it the hot favorite among developers.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hassle Free Database Migrations </b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laravel is a great way to sync databases. It allows you to keep the data in seeds and migrations. As far as another framework like MySQL is concerned, it might not be the best option to transfer the changes made in the databases through development machines. You can also supervise the database and keep it under your control.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Artisan Opens Ample Options </b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Command line is an important part of the web development process and acts as an important tool for the web developers. With the help of Artisan, one can run various tasks through the command line. Type, ‘php artisan’ in the terminal window and there will be multiple options for you. Since, it is driven by the Symphony Console component, you get a number of options for developing a web application.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Manage Dependency With Composer</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laravel acts as a dependency management system. Whenever you install them in a directory, they start dealing with libraries and ‘packages’ by managing them on a per project basis. To explain this, let’s take an example. Suppose you maintain a project that requires many libraries and those libraries depend on another set of libraries. Here, comes the role of the Composer. It helps you to declare the libraries after finding out the versions where they are to be inserted.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Robustness of Laravel in the Modern World</b></i></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than 80% of the websites around the world today, runs on PHP and Laravel is the hero among them. Amidst the multiple PHP frameworks that are available in the market today, Laravel is the undisputed leader as far as large-scale <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web application development is concerned</a>. You can easily execute any large scale project within few days.</p>

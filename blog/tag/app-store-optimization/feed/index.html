<p>What does it take to launch an app?</p>



<p>The question seems a bit ridiculous, we know. After all, you don’t really need anything to launch an app, except for an app of course.</p>



<p>It may sound like a simple thing, but trust us when we say, it is not. The launch phase of an app is what follows after an <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/" target="_blank">app’s development</a>, and it is an incredibly important phase for your app’s success. </p>



<p>So no, “how to launch a mobile app?” is not that much of a ridiculous question after all. </p>



<p>Now if you are someone who is looking for a good launching strategy, or want to know how to launch an app, then you are at the right place.</p>



<p>We are going to delve deep into the world of launching strategy for mobile applications and invite you along with us. But before talking about anything, let’s see why you really need a launching strategy.</p>



<h2>Importance Of A Launching Strategy</h2>



<p>There are still some people who are not yet convinced that an app really needs a launching strategy. For them, the best way to launch an app is to develop and put it on the stores.</p>



<p>So let us talk about the importance of mobile app launch strategy in brief. </p>



<h3>1. Creating A Momentum</h3>



<p>The first importance of a release strategy for your app is creating a momentum. </p>



<p>People are not going to automatically know that your app is in the market. They are not going to find out about it unless it shows up on their app store homepage, or someone tells them about your app. Which is why, with a proper strategy, you can create momentum before the launch, to get the users excited, and hyped up about your app. </p>



<p>The momentum you build before the launch of your app is going to define what kind of success your app has after being launched. </p>



<h3>2. Getting Downloads</h3>



<p>Obviously, the point of creating an app is to get downloads from the users. </p>



<p>With a strategy in place before app release, you can notify more and more people about your app. And the more people know about it, the more downloads you will get right out of the bat. It is tedious to just launch an app and then wait for the download numbers to come creeping in. if you want a high number of downloads from the very beginning, you need to figure out how to publish an app. </p>



<h3>3. Gaining And Retaining Users</h3>



<p>Once you have got those download numbers up and high, you want to get more users and preferably retain them right?</p>



<p>All of us have installed at least one app on our phones that we have uninstalled within the first 10 minutes of use. Now you don’t want that to happen to your app. Which is why you need to know how to launch a new app idea to make sure that users actually use your app regularly, rather than use it once and uninstall it. </p>



<h3>4. Growth Of Business</h3>



<p>The success of your app is important for the growth of your business. You don’t want to end up like <a href="https://oursocialtimes.com/twitter-is-closing-down-vine-what-went-wrong/" target="_blank">Vine</a>, do you?</p>



<p>The problem with Vine was that it failed to keep up with the market of video sharing apps and the growth of its own popularity. Which is why you need a proper mobile app launch strategy to make sure that your business faces proper growth, and you can balance that growth with your app. </p>



<h3>5. Developing A Better App</h3>



<p>The launching phase is going to include a lot of feedback from early users. And this feedback is going to help you better your app. </p>



<p>The beta testing process during the launching phase is going to point out a lot of things that can be tweaked in your app to make it a better one. And at the end of the day, delivering the users with a better app is the key to app success. </p>



<h3>6. Providing Value To Your Users</h3>



<p>An app without value is only going to be a waste of phone memory. </p>



<p>Seems harsh, but it is true. Whether you are making a utility app, or a gaming app, at the end of the day it needs to provide some sort of value to the users. And the understanding of what kind of value your app is going to bring to the table will only come to you during the making of the launching strategy.</p>



<p>While conducting target audience research, you will understand what they need and your app will take shape according to that need of users. This way your app is going to get a proper value proposition for the users. </p>



<h2>So How To Launch An App- The Stepping Stones</h2>



<p>Now we come to the launching part.</p>



<p>It may seem surprising, but the making of the mobile app launch plan begins before the development phase has even started. Here is a brief outlook:</p>

<ol class="scrollspy-links">
<li><a href="#step1"> Conduct a thorough market research</a></li>
<li><a href="#step2"> Research target audience</a></li>
<li><a href="#step3"> Define a success metric</a></li>
<li><a href="#step4"> Price strategizing</a></li>
<li><a href="#step5"> Create a landing page</a></li>
<li><a href="#step6"> Create a website</a></li>
<li><a href="#step7"> Social media presence</a></li>
<li><a href="#step8"> Planning a marketing strategy</a></li>
<li><a href="#step9"> Developing screenshots for app store</a></li>
<li><a href="#step10"> App store optimization</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#8217;s find out these in details.</p>



<h2 id="step1">1. Why Do You Need Market Research?</h2>



<p>The smartphone app market is a dynamic place that is changing every day. What is trendy today, may become outdated tomorrow. Not to mention that the market is crowded with millions of different apps. If you don’t believe then check out the below graph that will show you the number of apps on different app stores.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RmAWyPqtSIv65AAF3bOwOPbU3QxWA4UkYTvHu4_FKemZkcOKfITtv44oydzb826XtgpOQmolasvFtzpNAh5LwWL62e7zV8O1NvlDiSK2uEEJKj8kNM1HbItADIYgauTlHR9wX_M" alt="how to launch an app stats" />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/" target="_blank">Statista</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>With such a high number of apps in the market, you have to find your niche. You need to find a point of need among the users that you can fulfill with your app. If you can’t find a need, then create one. And to find that niche, you need to conduct market research. </p>



<p>Here is a step by step approach to conduct a systematic market research. </p>



<ul>
<li>Identify what people need but are not aware of</li>
<li>See how much that need is in demand</li>
<li>Look for existing apps that address the need</li>
<li>Check their success rate and for how long they’ve been in the industry</li>
<li>Check for opportunities you can use to penetrate the market</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="step2">2. Who Are You Targeting With Your App?</h2>



<p>A businessman is not going to use a makeup tutorial app, and a makeup artist is not going to use a stock trading app. </p>



<p>There are always going to be exceptions to the above point, but by and large, it is true. Every app caters to a specific group of users. So if you want to know how to market an app successfully you need to figure out which group of users your app caters to. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HiDVqLMKSqHNvy0kKiHYYfwBo1Y71dQqT3NYsW3vimWe963-U78FgIABDje21unowb3ykqkti3EDIqmyUWSLhxSIUNc13Ov56LBqtmsp1f47JSTWO4w_PqAcnz8OJLg_4DX5sJU" alt="how to launch an app with user targetting" /></figure>



<p>The users are central to any app company. Before you learn how to launch an app, you need to learn who your target audience is. Knowing your user-base and their mindset is instrumental in steering your app’s performance.</p>



<p>Once you have identified your target audience, it will become clear how to market your app to them, and once you have that figured out, your app will get popular in no time. </p>



<h2 id="step3">3. What Will Define Success For Your App?</h2>



<p>What is going to define success for your app? Is it the number of downloads? Or the amount of revenue generated? Or the app store rating? Whichever it is, you have to determine the success metrics for your app, and then work on building it up.</p>



<p>Not determining the success metrics early on is going to leave you with no direction. Sure you will have an app in the market, but how are you going to decide whether it is earning enough success or not? What if the app ends up with a 100% good rating (improbable, but still) on the app store, but earns little to less revenue? That is barely success.</p>



<p>But if you have the right success metrics defined, you won’t feel lost. For example, if the success metric for your app is the revenue generated, then you can put more emphasis on generating proper revenue. </p>



<h2 id="step4">4. What Is Going To Be Your Monetization Strategy?</h2>



<p>The upkeep and management of your app are going to not only cost you time but money as well. And to generate this money, you need a monetization strategy.</p>



<p>Monetization is obviously important for your app. Without a proper monetization strategy, you won’t be able to generate revenue, and eventually, your business will fail. At the same time, you also have to think about the pricing strategy. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/proven-mobile-app-monetization-strategy/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" width="981" height="227" class="wp-image-9828" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/app-monetization-ideas.png" alt="app monetization strategy" /></a></figure>



<p>The pricing strategy and monetization hand in hand. The consumers want a free app, but you can always include in-app purchases to bank on users who are already satisfied with your free services. Besides learning how to market an app, you should strategize a price that would fetch optimum profit, you should look for:</p>



<ul>
<li>How much your competitors are charging?</li>
<li>Are they offering free software upgrades?</li>
<li>What kind of subscription plans are they offering? </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="step5">5. A Landing Page For The User To Land On!</h2>



<p>A crucial point of an app marketing plan, the landing page is going to be the entry point for your website. It is going to help you to create a two-way communication channel between you and your clients. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dc-59GPH2tx9Su0gYyYZeJDX3jQB61_mOtkmT9amO7KmUasxIsaskvJIIhEgFfot3TRwjuBTcQY1UDDOxUs37s16IvGJ8xd2WwP9EPXA-_XX20OhpaParDk-r4nd-ZTmfeFaq-g" alt="how to launch an app like spotify" />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.spotify.com/in/" target="_blank">Spotify</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>With a properly designed landing page, the visitors to your app website is going to find out about your app. Not only that, if you can interest them enough, they might even end up registering for the early access for the app, so don’t forget to add the proper CTA buttons. </p>



<p>For example, you can see the landing page for Spotify, the most famous music streaming app. The single line “Music for everyone” conveys the purpose of the app, and the perfect placement of the CTA button makes it easier for the users to start engaging with the website. </p>



<p>Landing page also helps you to collect customer details. This is going to help you to get familiar with them, as well as identify their potential desires that even they might not be aware of.</p>



<h2 id="step6">6. Get A Website For The App</h2>



<p>Of course, you can’t have a landing page without a website. </p>



<p>The app website is going to be an absolutely important part of your launching strategy. Where else are the potential users going to find out about your app? A well designed and marketed website attracts huge traffic, which means more users when the app is finally launched.</p>



<p>Once the app is launched, that huge number of traffic is going to readily download your app and some of them might even be interested in becoming registered users. And that’s how a well-designed website is going to bring you ready users from the genesis of your app. Just make sure to make the website really attractive.</p>



<h2 id="step7">7. Enhance your Social Media Presence</h2>



<p>Even puppies and cats have Instagram profiles today. So it goes without saying that your app to needs a social media presence. </p>



<p>Today social media platforms have become the modern marketing powerhouse. People of all social classes are part of the social media today, so no matter who your target audience is, social media platforms are the best way to reach them. </p>



<p>You need to start with the official social media page on every platform. Don’t forget to add social media sharing features within your app, so that people can share it directly on their timeline. This way your app will get an increased viewership.</p>



<p>Keep posting images and promo videos on social media accounts. The goal with an enhanced presence on social media sites is to keep in constant touch with the viewers there. This way some viewers might even get interested enough, that when the app launches, they will install and check it out. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/T0umnNMGr3J_o0pXbhoxhblF_sD4WHbOSzOqibnyRK5gGgeaLuA0Wp-F2T6MEYLNsQ-8W-8okRYWp0wa1fUxHOGcn_y8dYxcFRZDIq2tokNyKCEDBst4VgCH3Kja_p6A1V5K3fo" alt="how to launch an app and enhance your social media presence" />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/canva/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Another way of building a prominent presence on social platforms is through a partnership with influencers. These social media influencers have a huge follower base and these followers look up to their posts and updates every day. If you, in fact, make a partnership with such influencers, your app is sure to be exposed to hundreds and thousands of people, becoming a global sensation.</p>



<h2 id="step8">8. Creating A Press Kit, The Last Minute Prep</h2>



<p>So your app is developed, the stage is set, and now it’s time to get the press involved.</p>



<p>The ending of the above sentence may seem sinister, but there is nothing sinister about it. Getting the press involved, and by that, we mean informing important bloggers and journalists about your app and when it launches is going to give your app the exposure it needs. Getting sufficient press coverage is an important part of app marketing strategy</p>



<p>When your app is being covered in the articles of famous tech blogs and websites like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank" >The Verge</a> or <a href="https://www.wired.com/" target="_blank">Wired</a>, people will easily become curious to check out your app. But these websites are not going to cover your blog just like that. For that, you need to create a press kit. </p>



<p>A press kit will ensure that anyone wanting to cover your app doesn’t have to explore the internet to find information. In a press kit you need to include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>App information: logo, screenshots, promo video, etc.</li>
<li>App description (preferably the one from the app store product page)</li>
<li>Public marketing and social media links</li>
<li>Links for recent press release coverages</li>
<li>Contact information</li>
</ul>



<p>Compiling this press kit will help the influencers, bloggers, and journalists to quickly scan the information about your app. This way they can easily cover your app since all the information is right there in the press kit. </p>



<h2 id="step9">9. Aesthetic Screenshots For The App Store</h2>



<p>When you search for an app and click on the one at the very top of the search list, you will not only find an app description, but you will also find screenshots of the app. These screenshots are usually of very high quality and serve as a visual description of the app. </p>



<p>The screenshots are not only aesthetically pleasing, but they will let the potential user know what they look like on the phone screen. So you are launching an app on iTunes or Play Store, visuals are a must. Take the youtube music app screenshots for example:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dXETF-ROKJN730ie4RYZ3S3fdtBezaJ-iA6_myOcVEorY5JI0YThnlt_mkS23R-g0apeVEbGFR1GvwOaSOlGe2sPmzxThdGpwX6HiSv3ngGJ6YQaK3NX2rASZAdMsE9YtsW6ksg" alt="how to launch an app with right screenshots" />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-music/id1017492454" target="_blank">Apple</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Each of the above screenshots features a different screen of the app, and it gives you a clear idea of how the app will look on your phone. </p>



<p>On the other hand, these screenshots also provide you with a short description of how the app works, what it is used for. If you look at Bumble’s google play store screenshots:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9yQq71eaQDkfimYcKuW8L0cG2DgdQb-miuSz0cdXtLzufj3IoSh5I3kzEc644dB1v0VzDrDsrSAQiCaBrXzpg4hD1_YZPhsXw2wS-KGNl8YUkuBTLXSgJoviDFpacDJptisOzYU" alt="how to launch your app" /> 


<p>The three screenshots, with the words “dates” “friends” and “network”, gives the user an apt idea on what the app is going to help you. Even though videos and gif files have taken precedence over the visual descriptions today, a bright, and aesthetically pleasing screenshot goes a long way to let the people know why they should really give your app a try. </p>



<h2 id="step10">10. Optimize Your App Store Presence</h2>



<p>App store optimization is going to be an important part of your app launch marketing strategy.</p>



<p>ASO or app store optimization is the process of optimizing your mobile apps so that they rank higher on the app store search results. The higher your app is ranking on the search results, the better the number of downloads you will get. The increased visibility is going to get you more traffic on your app page on the app store. So if you are thinking about how to launch an app in the Google Play store or how to launch an app on the app store, then you have to pay ASO enough attention. </p>



<p>Most of the apps are discovered through the app store searches. So how are you going to optimize the app store presence of your app so that it ranks higher in the search results? Here are a few ways.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>App Name: </strong>the first thing anyone notices about an app is the name. The app name is going to carry the essence and meaning of your app. The audience will know with the name what the app does. So make sure to properly name your app, and include relevant phrases with it. Having a catchy and properly relevant name will make it easy for the users to find your app. </li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>: keywords play an important part in the process of ASO. keywords are basically the phrases users use to search for a specific app. For example, if the user is searching for a meditation app, then they are definitely going to see apps with meditation in their names. Like:</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rW3sA606FFgleZpEYE5LrDpmcNUn2U98-gf7LTY4xOByoxSCFHliemG932DXcv6lB9Gi-3dXWxJiMpWhFUQR7dw-1EM-enl7VJmYl9WQo8kJOr8a5JsVpQhAxQlSUouZUz1A-Aw" alt="how to launch an app with right app store optimization" />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/headspace-meditation-sleep/id493145008" target="_blank">Apple</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Having the word “meditation” included in the name, Headspace makes it easier for its app to rank higher on the search results. </p>



<h2>Last But Not The Least, Use In-App Analytics</h2>



<p>It is important to monitor the app’s performance once the app was released. This way you can evaluate the app’s performance and make changes according to the requirements of the app. </p>



<p>The app analytics tool helps you to find out how many people are using your app, how they are using it, how many have installed it once and then uninstalled it. The app analytics will identify and analyze the core issues of the app. So it is absolutely important that you employ an app analytic tool before you go on to launch an app in the market. </p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>So it turns out app launching is not that simple. </p>



<p>Sure there are plenty of hoops to jump through to get your app successfully launched in the market. But once you have a proper launching strategy in place then you will see that at the end of the day it is not really that hard.</p>

<p>Just follow all the mobile app launch checklist we have mentioned in the article and you will find the entire launching process to be simpler than it seems to be. </p>

<p>Don’t you always wish to get the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/" target="_blank">app that you make</a> on the top of App Store rankings, eh?</p>



<p>You must have thought on how to rank your app in Google Play. Well, guess what, a smartly planned ASO can help you achieve it. How?</p>



<p>ASO or App Store Optimization enables users to find your product in the app store. To rank it higher, you have to strategize a good ASO [App Store Optimization] process and keep track of the latest updates in the market.</p>



<p>You need to constantly iterate the process and bring variations in your strategy based on the ever-changing market scenario. As a result, you’ll be able to maintain a fair ranking throughout.</p>



<p>The term ASO might sound a bit technical and often tend to intimidate people who’re new to the concept. But there’s nothing to worry about. The process is simple, yet systematic. It depends on how you implement it rather than the complexity of the process itself. So let’s get started.</p>



<h2>So What is ASO?</h2>



<p>In short, App Store Optimization is defined as the process of increasing a product’s ranking on a mobile app store [Google Play/Apple App Store].</p>



<p>It starts with a user searching with a certain keyphrase.<br /><br />Well, if you dig a bit of history on ASO or how it all started, you will find interesting information. Back in 2009, “app store optimization”- this term was first introduced by Johannes Borchardt, in his presentation. Soon, this term became immensely popular in the industry. TechCrunch and Search Engine Watch &#8211; these two globally renowned web news platforms started using this term too by 2012.</p>



<p>The app store engine identifies the keywords and displays related apps. It is here you need to rank your product, so that it appears within the first 5 to 7 displayed apps, thus increasing the likelihood of getting noticed. A good ASO fetches more users, thus creating more conversions. Similar to SEO, it depends on proper keywords.</p>



<p>Yes, you heard that right. As mentioned earlier, the concept is the same, only the platform has changed. ASO is nothing but SEO of app store search engine you can say.</p>



<h2>What Are The Top Benefits Of Implementing ASO?</h2>



<p>Why spend time on something that doesn’t help in creating value, right?</p>



<p>Obviously, you’d like to know the advantages of using an ASO. There is a general consensus that app store optimization is the most effective of all marketing strategies, given the increasing digitization of advertisement and promotional processes. And ASO helps in effective utilization of this opportunity.</p>



<p>Here are two of the many impactful results you get when you implement a good ASO.</p>



<h3>1. It Helps Your Application Get Found</h3>



<p>Despite all the hard work, people often end up miserable when their products fail to show up in the top results page. Until your application is found by the optimum number of users, all your hard work, features, etc are useless. No downloads, no customer base, no revenue; hence a total waste of time, money and energy. ASO can help you avoid this situation and get maximum results.</p>



<h3>2. Assists In Organic Downloads</h3>



<p>What does a user do when he/she first comes across a cool app? You’re right, they download it. This is known as Organic Download. It means that the developers don’t persuade you to install their product, rather you get interested in their features and download it yourself. A good ASO assists you in creating more and more organic downloads. Plus doing this saves a lot of money since you no longer have to focus on ads, and yet have a steady growth in the consumer base.</p>

<p>As you can see, the statistics clearly indicate the exponential increment in the number of downloads as a result of ASO implementation.</p>



<h2>What Are The Important ASO factors?</h2>



<p>Broadly speaking, there are two important factors that determine ASO success rate:</p>



<h4>On-Metadata Factors</h4>



<p>These are the elements you can control as a developer. Things like logo, keywords, descriptions, demo videos, etc fall under this category.</p>



<h4>Off-Metadata Factors</h4>



<p>These are the elements that you cannot control but can influence indirectly. Parameters like search volume, download volume, conversion rate, user volume, etc fall under this category.</p>



<h2>12 App Store Optimization Best Practices &#8211; To Make Your App ‘Found’</h2>



<p>Understanding the market is very crucial when it comes to launching a product. You need to identify the market trends, peers, opportunities and growth. This will help you in determining the keywords that we’ll be discussing shortly. You can learn how different countries respond to similar apps and how you can address the existing problems.</p>



<p>Now that you have a fair idea on what ASO is and how to strategize, let’s dive into the app store optimization guide checklist on some technical know-how and how you as a budding entrepreneur can utilize them in your favor.</p>



<h3>1. Identifying Your Niche</h3>



<p>This is perhaps the most important step one has to take before getting on board with the development process. Your target audience can’t be everyone. Launching a product for the general audience has almost always proven to be futile.</p>



<p>the following figure depicts the most popular Apple App Store categories in May 2019:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="672" height="441" class="wp-image-9689" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/types-of-industry-popular-in-app-store.png" alt="types of industry popular in app store.png" />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.statista.com/" target="_blank">Statista</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Every product is meant for its corresponding niche. All the more reason why you should identify your niche is that it helps you to develop the features in accordance with your niche’s demand. Thus, it makes it more specialized. This narrowing down of the process also helps you to generate unique features, so that your product stands out in the market.</p>



<h3>2. Decide On The Title</h3>



<p>It is the very first thing that a user sees when he/she comes across an app. The first impact a title has on the user psyche determines whether they’ll click on it and read the entire description.</p>



<p>A mere name has the power to steer a user’s action. Often it has the customers install the app altogether. So while deciding on the title, make sure it’s unique and appealing, but at the same time easy to read.</p>



<p>You can also insert the keywords within your title (in fact it’s recommended you do, it increases the findability many times; we’ll be mentioning that in the keyword section section as well).</p>



<h3>3. Research Your App Store Keywords</h3>



<p>Android and iOS app store keywords volume form the very crux of the app store optimization process. It is very similar to SEO. Better keywords, (apple app store keywords/google play store keywords) ensure better ranking- that should be the core mantra of keyword research.   When going for the research, consider the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>App Features</li>
<li>Variations In Your Feature Descriptions</li>
<li>Apps Sharing Similar Titles</li>
<li>The Category It Falls Into</li>
<li>Keywords That Fall Under The Same Category</li>
<li>Google Play Store App Keywords</li>
</ul>



<p>Plus including keywords in your app title will deliver better results. A study shows that there is a 10% boost in the conversion rate when keywords are included in the app title.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1000" class="wp-image-9690" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/app-store-optimziation-process-for-keywords.png" alt="app store optimziation process for keywords" />

<p>There are products who went from ranking somewhere on the third page to the topmost position on the first page of Google.</p>



<p>All due to altering the keyword inclusion in the title. However, app store keyword optimization is an ongoing process, and entrepreneurs have to constantly update their keywords to maintain their ranking. It’s similar to SEO, where you have to modify the algorithms to meet a degree of the app store promotion.</p>



<p>You can use the Google Keyword Planner for deciding on better keywords. They provide ways of keyword structuring in great details</p>



<p>This ever changing nature of keywords is a great opportunity since you’re getting the liberty to improve the existing keywords, hence creating better results for organic search.</p>



<h3>4. Describe Your Product Well</h3>



<p>A good description is essential in informing users about the features and functionalities of the app. Without it, there won’t be any clarity on what you’re trying to convey.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="654" height="594" class="wp-image-9688" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/app-store-description.png" alt="app store description" />

</figure>



<p>As you must know that keyword stuffing is outdated and highly discouraged by search engines. So as an entrepreneur, you have to devise ways in which you can naturally adjust the keywords without disrupting the text flow or grammatical alignment. Plus the app store algorithm highly depends on good content. Hence it is always advised to emphasize on app descriptions.</p>



<p>Build separate sections for features, functionalities, values, product purpose, etc. Use proper headings and subheadings with bullet points to increase the readability, so that the reader remains hooked till the end and gains a fair amount of clarity on what you’re trying to convey.</p>



<h3>Insert Subtitles If Necessary</h3>



<p>Suppose your target keyword is too long to be included in the title. You can create a separate section as the subtitle and insert them. It would act as a short description placed just prior to the main description part. Subtitles help in developing the keywords as part of the description itself.</p>



<h3>Design The Right Icon</h3>



<p>Visuals always play an important role when it comes to marketing a product. And digital marketing has made it all the more essential. A good app icon should be the visual art that lures a user on a subconscious level.</p>



<p>While an icon can never be the direct factor behind conversions, it, however, has a long-lasting impact on the user mind that eventually leads to a brand’s success. Users tend to develop a subconscious affinity towards an icon without realizing it.</p>



<p>Plus whatever message your product is trying to convey is portrayed visually by your icon. So it should be as impactful as possible. But keep in mind not to make it too stuffy. Make it look natural, informative and visually appealing.</p>



<p>To ensure your logo is liked by the users, launch four to five variations in your MVP. Test and iterate the process until your logo gets substantial likings.</p>



<h3>Pick The Right Category</h3>



<p>Suppose you’ve built a food delivery app and want the best ranking for it in the app store. But what category would you put it in? Surely you can’t include it in the payment app section. Doing that would only confuse the app seeker. Plus apps slipping into the wrong category heavily impact their findability, hence their ASO. So make sure the category is carefully thought out.</p>



<h3>Insert Screenshots</h3>



<p>Whenever you explore a product on the playstore, you’ll always find some screenshots used alongside the descriptions. It helps in picturizing the entire app description, hence the product idea. 5 to 7 screenshots usually suffice, although you can always increase the number.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="999" height="507" class="wp-image-9692" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/app-screenshots.png" alt="app store optimization and importance of screenshots" />
<figcaption><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/abc-live-tv-full-episodes/id364191819" target="_blank">abc-live-tv-full-episodes</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>But make sure not to overcrowd the section with too many flashy screenshots. The screenshots should be informative and elegant. The inside of the app, the user interface should be clearly reflected in the screenshots. As visual elements, they play a crucial role in creating downloads.</p>



<p>The screenshots should be zoomable and haze free. Remember, visual clarity is a must when it comes to any form of digital marketing.</p>



<h3>Don’t Forget The Demo Videos</h3>



<p>Be honest when we ask you “What’s your favourite information platform; video or description?” There’s no denying that a large chunk of internet users [probably the majority] prefers video descriptions over anything else.</p>



<p>Experiments show that human brain responds better to motion texts or videos. Even GIFs are preferred over traditional descriptions. So, it is always suggested that you insert some good eye-catching videos describing your product features so that the visitors have clarity and become interested to install your app. Because more installations increase your ASO ranking.</p>



<h3>Localize Your Product</h3>



<p>Launching a product in English only is a foolish move. If you think that people search for products only in English, then you’re gravely mistaken. There’s a large Hispanic population that never search in English. Or take for example the Arab countries, the chinese, the Koreans, etc. They all search in their mother tongue.</p>



<p>So if you want to achieve a global app store recognition, it has to be on your customers’ terms. You need to launch your product in all possible major languages of the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FojJjB0Yr22Z_bWNBUdLjLarA9NnmdwWTK9jFj8gQbCvspOpKvziS7sCQJBZ8r2mbUmetVDMVlocIKkJZZCGwArSolvLNZ7Xl_VagmV2fcNyuR_jI3Ro_3w54Bf8nqQeQ-Ahq2o" alt="app store optimization keywords localization" />

</figure>



<p>Reports have it, that an app’s market share increases tenfold, when it’s launched on a multilingual platform. You too, should address this as an opportunity.</p>



<h3>Give Them A Platform For Feedbacks</h3>



<p>You know how apps really become preferred among the user base? How does it increase the probability of getting downloaded? User reviews! You heard that right. It’s always user reviews.</p>



<p>Consider yourself going to the app store, looking for an app with some desired features. You find innumerable apps displaying the same set of features, all promising quality service.</p>



<p>Whatever the image or goodwill, you always look for the reviews first. Your eye automatically falls on the ratings when you browse through the app list. Good reviews attract users. They gain a level of trust and put their faith in the one with positive feedback. A good ASO ia a direct outcome of user reviews. Better rating guarantees higher app store ranking. Simple. So make sure your app has more of it.</p>



<p>Once the user downloads and has considerable experience with your app for like a month or two, subtly ask them for quick feedback. Don’t push it hard, just ask for it once a week. Remember to insert a remove option, should the user want to eliminate the feedback pop up forever. This flexibility you have to maintain. While ratings are important, but you can never force someone to do it. It will only result in customer loss.</p>



<h3>Iterate The Process</h3>



<p>The cycle of iteration is very important not only in case of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mvp-precursor-successful-product-seems-yes-pratip-biswas" target="_blank">MVPs</a>, but also here in ASO process. After all, you’re following the same iteration path: Launch, Analyze, Optimize and Test. And then repeat the same process over and over till you reach perfection in the eyes of your users.</p>



<p>Every time you iterate, you’ll find that you missed out on some points. So you work on them and test them in the market. This cycle of evaluation and execution is very helpful for improving the ASO ranking.</p>



<h2>So What’s Next?</h2>



<p>There are two important things you should definitely do after completing the aforementioned procedures:</p>



<h3>ASO Performance Analytics</h3>



<p>Now that you’re done with the development and app store deployment part, you need to track the performance. Everyone wants his/her product to perform at an optimum level. So if you don’t track it, you’ll never know how well it’s performing or what’s wrong with the product.</p>



<p>For that, you need a good app store optimization software. Analyzing every data by yourself is a tedious task and often results in complexity and exhaustion. But fortunately, there are some pretty good ASO analytics tools that can assist you in accomplishing it.</p>



<p>App Annie and SplitMetrics are two of the most popular analytics tools in the market. Using any one of them will give you detailed analyses of all performing aspects of your product. This is really helpful in determining the ASO success rate, given the already intense competition in the app store.</p>



<h3>Constant App Updation</h3>



<p>Updating an app on a regular interval is healthy for both you and your users. Updates not only help in correcting glitches, bugs and certain other flaws, but also  offer brand new features, and updates on the existing features.</p>



<p>Updates help in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/" target="_blank">improving the UI/UX of the app</a>. It reduces the monotony that plagues the users when an app remains un-updated for too long. The user also feels addressed and taken care of. So it is very important that you conduct updates on a fixed interval.</p>



<p>However, it is suggested that you ask for permission and   not go for automatic updates. There are some users who prefer the older version of their app. Since you have no way of determining who prefers what, you should always give a pop up regarding the available updates, so that the user gets the freedom to decide on it.</p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>If you’ve read this far, congrats! You’ve understood the basics of ASO. Niche analysis, Keywords, descriptions, icon, etc everything you’ve gone through will help in increasing the ASO ranking. But remember, always keep updating yourself with the latest keywords and keep track of what users searching.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" width="981" height="227" class="wp-image-9683" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/app-development-cost-freelancer-vs-agency.png" alt="app store optimization from freelancer " /></a></figure>



<p>The core phrases and words they use are of extreme importance because you as an entrepreneur will have to increases the findability as much as possible. Because as mentioned earlier: better findability leads to a higher chance of getting downloaded. And higher downloads increase ASO rankings.</p>

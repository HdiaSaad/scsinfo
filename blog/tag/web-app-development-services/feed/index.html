										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know that about 30% of the time spent by the developers goes in surfing the source code? The cost of fixing bugs is almost 10 times and 100 times higher in the construction and designing phase respectively. Considering all these <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/want-the-best-web-app-development-use-these-5-javascript-frameworks/">web app development factors</a>, changes have come from time to time to facilitate the process of development. In other words, trends have come to the fore that helped developers to adapt themselves to the latest trends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through this blog, we intend to empower the knowledge of developers or any other code lover who want to keep themselves updated with the latest inclination in the programming industry.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Programming Revolutionizing Our Lives</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The blessings of programming on the human race are immense. It changed our approach to things in everyday life. The great evolution of apps now brings tasks at our fingertips. There is hardly any work left today which doesn’t comply with an application. From development languages to frameworks and development tools, programming underwent a metamorphosis since the last one decade. It is growing rapidly every day with new changes in the client expectation and project execution strategy. Another aspect of programming is that it also includes cloud computing which implements the same programming techniques.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Business is another important area where programming has bestowed its blessings. From the web app development perspective, DevOps, these days are focusing more on the outcomes. They are working closely with the operational team to give meaningful results to every project, which they undertake. Agility and continuous emphasis on development thus remain the two major components in app development. Whether it is PHP or Python, name any programming language today. Each one of them is directly co-related to business. Empowering business websites, extending the functionalities and making agile web apps is the core agenda for any web development company today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two ways of delivering a web app – either as a web application or as a client side application. If you are making an Android based app, you can specify style properties as well as viewport in order to accommodate it on all types of screen. Even defining an interface is now possible with the rise in the technological development happening in the industry. You can also call APIs based on a web application. From debugging to building web apps, programming has ignited the hope of success in web app development since the day of its evolution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest programming trends will act as a guide to DevOps, which they can utilize in their next project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Must To Know Programming Trends</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 1: Rise of Backend Service</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 21st-century programming will primarily focus less on self-managed applications. Rather, it will shift towards using third party services. The benefit will be to handle important aspects of a project in an organized manner. Cloud storage, user administration, and push notifications are some of the things that will come to the fore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rise of BaaS or Backend as a service will become popular and will facilitate the utilities of a web-based application. This will be beneficial from the enterprise point of view where scalability forms a vital part of developing the large-scale application. Now, the operations and engineering teams can compete with their rivals when it comes to delivering the best services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 2: Image Handling Becomes Easier</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With Backend as a service, uploading projects to the cloud or in any other social APIs is easier. But, there are many applications till date which fully rely on the good servers and improved development stacks to function in the best manner possible. Server positioning, on the other hand, becomes too much time consuming and difficult for the developers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Generating images in the machine while working simultaneously with frameworks, languages, libraries and OS help to make containers, this consists of machine images. If your team has not yet adopted or started utilizing it then it’s time to make use of it. The containers also have the ability to create existing services or making a new one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 3: More Dependency On Functional Languages</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest sophisticated applications need more storage capacity, with faster processor requirements and increasing bandwidth. Working with a single machine model makes it cumbersome for a developer to use the systems as the configurations do not match at all. The rise of functional programming has made it mandatory to adapt to new languages for complicated web app development process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Subsequently, there is a need for developers who has the ability to work with such languages. Functional programming, on the other hand, relies heavily on the mutable state. Here, comes the role of a functional language. It has a strong advantage over the normal object-oriented languages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 4: More Focus on Material Design</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the early days of web app development and design, flat design is something, which one was dependent upon, as a modern approach to UI design. But, it was the introduction of Material Design in 2016 that shifted the focus completely. It has given some stiff competition to companies like Apple and Microsoft, which heavily relies on flat design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary USPs  of material design is the three-dimensional effect with a lighting design. It gives a completely different depth to the components used digitally. For instance: when you use drop shadows, it enables the user to understand whether the element used in the application is clickable or not. It is expected that there will be a rise in UI design patterns as creative designers continue to embrace material design.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap up!</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Functional languages in web app development play an important role in increasing the user experience. Knowing the latest trends prevailing in the industry will make the DevOps aware about them and implement them successfully in a project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">You are tired and comfortably sitting on your couch at your home. You want to have a steamed coffee but there is nobody in the house to make you one. You don’t feel the urge to get up and make a coffee all by yourself. Instead, what you do is switch on the internet and your coffee is ready to be served.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine the above situation coming true!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three years from now, you are going to experience something similar. Amazed! Yes, this is what Internet of Technology (IoT) is going to do. According to a study done by CISCO, by 2020, more than 50 billion devices are going to be connected with IoT. Business houses are making rapid advances in the technology landscape with such technologies, thus making the workplace adapt to the regulatory requirements and increasing the employee efficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many household gadgets are constantly being upgraded in order to make them compatible with IoT. Once motion sensors, Wi-Fi adapters, and cameras are embedded in them, they will be completely ready to work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>The Future Is Here</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You have already come across the possibilities that IoT can achieve. Now we’ll present some more futuristic things which you can do with<br />
IoT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Self-parking of vehicles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Get notification warnings for your phones or any kinds of wearable devices when there are any potential threats to your device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Automatic progression of fitness levels, tracking health progress and making reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The option of ordering groceries and other household items.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While IoT is making news everywhere for its advance future, it’s partnership with web development can result in the creation of something spectacularly different.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>PHP And IoT: A Pathbreaking Discovery</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before we move ahead, let us know about PHP and about its working in detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PHP is a server-side scripting language used to make dynamic and interactive web pages. It accumulates all the images used in a website and gives the user an immersive experience. The language works smoothly and is best suited for server-side <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>website development services</strong></a>. While executing the code, PHP runtime plays an important role.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you might be thinking that IoT limits its usage only within devices, but you have not yet discovered the larger picture. In the next few paragraphs, we’re going to unfold the next big discovery which you can witness with the help of PHP and IoT.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>A PHP App Using IoT Device</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s some good news for <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-php-developers/">PHP developers</a> who are interested in developing IoT applications. Do you know that you can make a PHP app by using an IoT device? We’ll be discussing here in brief detail about the various processes that are involved in making such an app.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Things You Need</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You need the following things in order to make a PHP app with an IoT app. Take a look at the list below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Knowledge of PHP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A local environment for developing PHP with Apache.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android Studio.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blue Mix and Google Account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IDE or text editor.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Step-By-Step Explanation</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make things easier, we will take you through a step-by-step process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect Bluemix with IoT. The easiest way to do this is to create a Bluemix application first and then bind it with the IoT foundation. Once you have done it, login to your Bluemix account, click on ‘Create App’ and then select ‘ web,’ select the Internet of Things Foundation Starter boilerplate and click ‘Create’ in the ‘Create an App’ area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Here, you need to establish a connection between your devices and IoT. Go to the application page and select ‘Internet of Things Foundation Service.’ Doing this isolates your device and its data in a completely separate account. Now, select the ‘Launch Dashboard’ and go follow the steps from ‘creating a device’ to ‘adding a device.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now install the IoT starter in an android application. In order to this, open Android Studio. Go to ‘Quick Start,’ then select ‘Checkout project from version control’ and choose ‘Git.’ Go to the clone repository dialog now and click on ‘Clone.’ Copy the .apk file from your device and install it with the help of a file manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> This step involves transferring data from Android Starter to IoT. To do this, activate the app which you have installed. There will be a welcome screen, enter the name of the organization with the device identifier and the authentication token. Now, select the ‘Activate sensor’ button. You will start receiving messages different channels of the radio.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 5:</strong> You need to create an API key for having access to the application in this step. At this stage, you have already got a stream of data which is available in your IoT device. Before that, you need to verify that your application has proper access to IoT. Next, you need to activate the API by the following process:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Activate the IoT Foundation dashboard. Select Access and go to API Keys</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Generate an API key</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have done this, take the authentication token that has been generated in order to use the values in the following steps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Step 6: Now, you need to consume the data from IoT with the help of a PHP application. At this stage, the device, as well as the application, can access data from IoT with the help of a messaging protocol called ‘Message Queue Telemetry Transport’ (MQTT). With the help of accelerometer data, you can publish it to the IoT foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just as in a device, data is published to specific topics, in the same way even an application can consume all the data in the topics. Remember, there are two kinds of topics – cli-app.php and web-app.php. While the first one is useful in running the script at the command line or at the server control; on the other hand, the second one is useful in accessing a script through a web browser.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Wrap Up</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The transformation from the analog to the digital world has been characterized by many transformations. It has pushed the world to an advanced place. The successful merger of PHP and IoT will help the 21st-century man to live in a better place.</p>

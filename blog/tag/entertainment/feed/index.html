										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, last time we gave you the idea about <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/create-a-music-streaming-app-like-spotify/" target="_blank">what it takes to build music streaming app</a></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span>like Spotify!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haven’t read it already? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But are you aware of the music streaming app in detail?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is numerous music streaming apps in the market. The competition is intense. Ever wondered why Spotify is holding onto the top position for so long?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is right here!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us take you through the block level details to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build music app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music Streaming App Categorization</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primarily music streaming apps are categorized into on-demand music streaming and radio stations. Let us tell you more about the music app ideas.<br />
</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">On-Demand Music Streaming</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name suggests, music apps in this category play audio as per user preference. You can choose what you want to listen to. These music apps collaborate with popular music labels for collections. They also assist with music rights and royalties. Popular music apps like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoundCloud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Music, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">etc. belong to this category.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio Stations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio stations provide non-interactive music streaming experience to the users. The radio stations play audio which is trending. There is no option for user preference music. Some of the popular radio station apps are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandora Music</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">iHeart Radio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The users cannot play music as per their preference. They have the right to skip certain audio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brands need to collaborate with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SESAC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and BMI</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for licensing rights. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The licensing payment is less for radio station apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you planning for music streaming app development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Is yes, you have landed the right space- on-demand music streaming is your segment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, it is important to know what you are up against. Spotify is the king of music apps. It is a pioneer in this segment with its standout features.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Spotify Came in the Limelight</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify rules the music apps sector with its whopping user base and revenue figures. Midia Research stated Spotify user count of 96 million in 2018. That’s staggering 36% hike than 2017 figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the last quarter of 2018 alone, 9 million new subscribers joined the Spotify bandwagon. Premium subscription revenue stood at 4.81 million euros. The ad-supported revenue was 1.17 million euros.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-8629 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-2018-earnings-midia-research1-1-1.png" alt="music streaming app development subscribers" width="2000" height="1145" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-2018-earnings-midia-research1-1-1.png 2000w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-2018-earnings-midia-research1-1-1-300x172.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-2018-earnings-midia-research1-1-1-768x440.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-2018-earnings-midia-research1-1-1-1024x586.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever wondered the reason behind its success?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well! The answer lies in the strategies and user offerings. Spotify did not land on the successful platform overnight. It implemented viable business factors that connected well with the target audience. It evolved well with time to emerge as a market leader.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology Baseline For Music Streaming App Development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology forms the backbone for music streaming apps. No matter how good that idea looks on paper, it is the technology that determines performance. It is essential to know the technology stack that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build music streaming app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just the way you want it. Also, if you are thinking about how to build a music streaming website and technology for the same, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/" target="_blank">have a look here</a>.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/create-a-music-streaming-app-like-spotify/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8711" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/music-steaming-app-development-cta-3-1.png" alt="music streaming app development cta 3" width="981" height="227" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/music-steaming-app-development-cta-3-1.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/music-steaming-app-development-cta-3-1-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/music-steaming-app-development-cta-3-1-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that Spotify stores the music in servers. So, when a user requests a track, it is sent to user device directly. The music files are cached in the user devices. Hence there is no need to retrieve them again. This setup is supported by a basic memory caching system, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cassandra and PostgreSQL.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use Python and Javascript for technology stack development for your music streaming app. PHP is used to a certain extent on the server side. And, Java is used for backend development. Spotify primarily uses this methodology.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to manage costs and get stunning results, we recommend this technology stack:</span></h3>
<p>• NodeJS can be used for data management and processing in real-time.</p>
<p>• Amazon CloudFront facilitates video streaming across different locations with the help of wide-ranging protocols. They are layered on top of HTTP.</p>
<p>• Another effective addition to the AWS Elemental Media Services is Amazon Content Delivery Network (CDN). It allows effective implementation of two types of video streaming. Firstly, on-demand content streaming that is stored in Amazon S3. It is also known as Amazon Simple Storage Service. Secondly, is live streaming or 24&#215;7 channels.</p>
<p>• Another effective tool for on-demand video streaming is Wowza Video on Demand (VOD) software. Users can stream high-definition videos to any device seamlessly. It supports adaptive playback, content security, and VOD playlist creation.</p>
<p>• AngularJS or ReactJS is useful towards UI/UX design for mobile and desktop app.</p>
<p>• BootStrap or HTML5 is effective for web app development.</p>
<p>• Nginx is good to have a tool as open source HTTP. It also acts like a proxy server.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Features That Will Make Your Music App Stand Out</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know how Spotify made it to the top spot? It&#8217;s the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">music streaming app features</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Apart from having an extremely versatile music collection. Let’s look into some of the unique features that this admired music app showcases. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Get Info About What You Hear</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify has a triple-dot button in the Now Playing panel. It has a “View Album” and “View Artist” option. The first one shows the album in which the song appears. And, the second option shows more songs from the same artist.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Playlist Recovery</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to listen to a track from a playlist created a while ago? But, accidentally deleted it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry as Spotify can recover your playlist. You just need to sign in to your account in the web client. There is a “Recover Playlists” option in the left panel. You just need to select the playlist of your choice and hit “Recover”. And, hola! You can enjoy your long heard track.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Enjoy Music Offline</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, that’s true. You can enjoy your favorite music even without an internet connection. This feature is available to the premium subscribers. Users can download up to 10,000 songs. This is effective even when you want to save on your data usage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, this can be done in 5 different devices. But your music streaming app development partner must have got enough experience to achieve this. </span></p>

So, if you are a premium Spotify member and happen to have high-quality earphones, you can put that to good use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is interesting to see that Spotify takes care of both user types. Whether you are a free or premium member, you get incredible music experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify touches the user’s music requirements in the most intricate way. The detailed service line and features prove its worthiness for the top position in this segment. Most mid level music app development companies, do give this a miss. But it has to be your best bet. Always ask your development partner to help you with multi device support. Why compromise?</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Payment Integration</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify incorporates seamless payment modes for both Android and iOS platforms.

<figure id="attachment_8636" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8636" style="width: 2308px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-8636 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-business-model-1.jpg" alt="music streaming app development spotify business model" width="2308" height="1740" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-business-model-1.jpg 2308w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-business-model-1-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-business-model-1-768x579.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spotify-business-model-1-1024x772.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2308px) 100vw, 2308px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8636" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Fourweekmba</figcaption></figure>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertisements</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a traditional way of revenue generation from online service. Spotify earns from its freemium service similarly. Users get small banner ads in between audio tracks. The duration of the ads between the tracks is decided as per requirement. If you want to enjoy ad-free music, you need to upgrade to the premium plan.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify has a promotional service known as Spotify Ad Studio for artists. They can promote their albums and songs through campaigns. Spotify aids in campaign creation and management for a price. The charges depend on the target selection.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have You Considered MVP for Music Streaming App Development?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the first step towards your music app development. Why? We will show you. It has plenty of business benefits for your app idea&#8230; </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Viability</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How would you know that your music app idea works? MVP is your answer. It helps you test your idea out in the real world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can launch an MVP for your music app and get valuable feedback from real users. You can make the necessary changes to the existing app concept. Also, this helps in better implementation of newer features.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick Development and Deployment</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can develop MVP with a minimum set of features. Hence, the music streaming app development process takes much less time. It also secures your app idea so that your competitors do not go ahead of you.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced Development Cost</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes in as the derivative of the previous pointer. Fewer features mean lesser development cost. For easy testing, omit the advanced features and add-ons in your MVP version.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minimized Investment Risks</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP is the prototype for your actual music streaming app. Hence, you can easily test the application without the need for a large investment. Additionally, if the MVP gets a positive response from users, you can plan on further investments for the final product. You will have a market insight to present your investors for the funding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who doesn&#8217;t love to tune into their favorite piece of music on a gloomy day? </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or at a house party?</span></p>



<p>Whatever be the case, music is LIFE.</p>



<p>The way it connects with human emotions, it is no surprise that music streaming app are mushrooming all over the app stores.</p>



<p>Now that &#8216;s one of the major reasons why business-minded people are looking to create music streaming apps. They are eyeing on the opportunities that come with it. But, <span style="font-weight: 400;">what do you need to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/" target="_blank">know before you start with building the app</a>?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have an <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/consulting-services/" target="_blank">idea in mind but looking for feasibility analysis</a></span> on the same?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This post is well crafted for you to kick start with your idea</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Let&#8217;s’ find out how to create a music app.</span></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, How To Create A Music Streaming App?</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know that music apps can make pretty good money for their owners, you are probably dying to make your own app and start making money with it. But it’s not so easy.</span></p>
<p>Here is a step by step process &#8211;</p>

<ol class="scrollspy-links">
<li><a href="#step1">Validating your app idea</a></li>
<li><a href="#step2"> Understand the target audience</a></li>
<li><a href="#step3"> Copyright matters to consider</a></li>
<li><a href="#step4"> Radio or on-demand?</a></li>
<li><a href="#step5"> Sketch the prototype</a></li>
<li><a href="#step6"> Creating MVP</a></li>
<li><a href="#step7"> Choose the features</a></li>
<li><a href="#step8"> How to make your music app secure</a></li>
<li><a href="#step9"> The cost to create a music app like Spotify</a></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start with some serious research on how to make a music app, you need to know about a couple of things. </span></p>



<h2 id="step1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Understand The Market Scope &#8211; Validate your Music App Idea</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market is loaded with many music streaming apps. Consequently, new features are introduced intermittently. This opens up new possibilities each day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever thought why Spotify made it to the top spot in the market of music streaming apps? It is claimed to be one of the premium streaming service providers. BusinessWire, in its research, revealed the revenues Spotify generated a humongous 1.5 billion USD in the third quarter of 2018. Out of this, USD 1.35 billion was channeled from Premium subscribers. Ad-supported Spotify users generated USD 160 million for the service provider. Therefore, it is evident that Spotify has been on a steady revenue generation streak since its launch in 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is why you need to chalk out the business scope and detailed path of the application development for the desired outcome. Spotify took their business seriously and defined their market scope to decide on their target audience and the revenue generation process they could use. So it is essential to identify the target audience. This factor will outline the interests and features to be incorporated into the application. It aids to identify the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). With time the company can add features as per preferences.</span></p>



<h2 id="step2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Who Are You Targeting?</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever app you are making, you have a target audience. If you don’t, then go back and define your target audience. Without them, your app is going to have a hard time making you money.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you are thinking that these apps don’t need a target audience, everyone listens to music, right?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turns out, not everyone is listening to the same music streaming app. According to this detailed look into the audience of different streaming apps, turns out, there is a major difference depending on the platform.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streaming services like Soundcloud attract more tech-savvy gamers as their audience. These are the people who would get a new gadget within a week of it being released. Pandora users, on the other hand, are more financially well off, and there is a large number of women among the Pandora app crowd. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify is meeting the middle ground, with social media-loving millennials as their audience base. Each music streaming service has its own audience base. And they cater to their needs.   </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, who is going to be your target audience? Determining a target audience is going to help you in choosing the right monetization strategy and make you big bucks. So decide on your audience before jumping onto the next step.</span></p>



<h2 id="step3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Do You Have Permission To Play That Song?</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t just play the music without permission.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, we are not talking about the angry neighbor complaining about your taste. We are talking about the license and permission required to make your music app a legitimate musical environment. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, you need the Public Performance Rights for your app. In the US, you can get it from any of these three agencies- The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) or Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI). In Europe, you can get this license from European Stage Authors and Composers (SESAC)</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you thinking about skipping on this licensing matter? You should know that when a song is played on your app without permission of the label and the artist, you will have to pay a fine of $700-$150,000 per song, every time it is played.  </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the next step after defining your target audience and acquiring the proper license is the development process. So before you decide how to make a music app for Android or iOS, layout a plan based on these steps.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before engaging in this step, research in details about how music streaming app work and how to make one. </span></p>



<h2 id="step4">4. Choose The Type Of Streaming App &#8211; Online Radio or On-Demand?</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heading may baffle you a bit, so let us explain. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two different kinds of music streaming apps.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Radio apps &#8211; works as a replacement for radio. You can stream music online, but you can’t choose what to listen to. The app will decide for you, based on your preferences. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On-demand music streaming app- plays music whenever, wherever, required you have a strong internet connection. You can create playlists, and choose which you want to hear. Shuffle and repeat all you want.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing this kind of system is an incredibly different process. So make sure you choose one before starting with the development process.</span></p>



<h2 id="step5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Sketch The Prototype</span></h2>





<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/mobile-application-development-three-options-developers-must-explore-for-prototyping/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">A prototype is a basic step towards developing an app</span></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In your music streaming app development process it is the first-hand representation of your app. With the prototype, you can conduct beta-testing among a small selected group of beta-testers. Their feedback is going to help you to make your app better. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So before making an app like Spotify, make a prototype first. This will let you know what you are doing right, and what you are doing wrong.</span></p>



<h2 id="step6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Develop the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mvp-precursor-successful-product-seems-yes-pratip-biswas/" target="_blank">Minimum Viable Product or MVP</a> is a basic mobile app with only the most necessary features in it. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you make an app that is full of amazing features, try to go with the MVP approach. Once you have your basic music streaming app, you can release it and gather feedback on it. And then use those feedbacks to improve your app farther.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1650" height="860" class="wp-image-9167" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/minimum-viable-product-of-music-streaming-app-1.png" alt="create a music streaming app and its MVP" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/minimum-viable-product-of-music-streaming-app-1.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/minimum-viable-product-of-music-streaming-app-1-300x156.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/minimum-viable-product-of-music-streaming-app-1-768x400.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/minimum-viable-product-of-music-streaming-app-1-1024x534.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></figure>
</div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this approach, you can slowly but surely build the perfect music streaming app. Rather than using the trial and error method, the MVP approach lets you utilize the user feedback to slowly build your app, incorporating different features into your app.  </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, with the MVP approach, you can understand your target audience well, and what works for them and what doesn’t. </span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone size-full wp-image-8617">
<figure id="attachment_8617" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8617" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-8617" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MVP_HQ4-1.jpg" alt="create a music streaming app MVP" width="635" height="449" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MVP_HQ4-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MVP_HQ4-1-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MVP_HQ4-1-768x543.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MVP_HQ4-1-1024x724.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8617" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Educati</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a pitstop before developing a fully functional app with all the features. This approach involves minimum coding and custom features. It is an evaluation of the business assumptions and necessary changes can be made from the outcome. This approach will help you with a clear understanding of your app. This clearly shows what works and what doesn’t.</span></p>



<p>So when you are wondering how to build a music app like Spotify, do go overboard with the features in it. Rather choose something unique for your own streaming app idea. Develop an MVP with one of-of the most important features and launch it in the test market. It&#8217;s all about understanding and evaluating the response. And then develop the rest.

<h2 id="step7">7. Features That You Need To Make A Music Streaming App</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the features that you need to focus on.</p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Seamless Registration: Let Your User Register Easy</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at a long-form to fill for a service is a tiresome process, especially for something that’s supposed to be fun, like music streaming app.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the registrations process is the first thing your user is going to interact with your app any bumps, and users will be completely discouraged with your app, no matter how perfect it may be.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides email and phone number registration, adding social media registration is a good way to make the login process seamless. Having a simple process for sharing songs online is going to give your streaming app the right kind of exposure.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_10137" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10137" style="width: 981px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10137 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-create-a-music-streaming-app-like-Spotify.jpg" alt="how to create a music streaming app like Spotify" width="981" height="409" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10137" class="wp-caption-text">Source: iTunes</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Search and Navigation: Make it Flawless</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main reasons why Spotify has become so popular is the user-specific song recommendations on the home screen. The advanced search option can aid in finding a song according to genre, artist or other interests. And there is also a “Your Library” feature which lists the user playlists, favorite songs and artists and much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you want to compete, then you have to make it easy for the user to find his favorite song. An advanced search option helps the user to find songs according to mood or artist and keeps up the engagement quotient high. The user must be able to find his favorite track within a few clicks. Include smart filters in your music app. This aids in minimizing the number of options to surf through. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added to that Spotify can also take your voice commands. You can tell the app to play a certain song or show artists&#8217; songs and albums. So don’t forget the voice recognition feature. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Socializing Through Melodies</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People today love sharing their activities through social media. Whether watching a movie, having dinner or listening to their favorite tunes. Which is why your app needs the social sharing feature. By giving your users a socially musical experience with convenient sharing options on various platforms, you’ll be creating a positive vibe for your brand.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will, in turn, give your brand a positive exposure on social media.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Music Collections: A Personalized Playlist</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it, the collection of songs is the backbone for your app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you decide on going with the on-demand music app, you will need this feature more than anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an on-demand platform, the user will want to arrange and sort their music based on mood, genre, and their favorites. So you need to give them the ability to create their own playlists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps like Spotify are also implementing the feature of Artist Radio playlist option. This feature offers to stream personalized songs as per user preference based on an artist. Regular updates are available in this segment. Additionally, there is a download option also. Hence, the user can enjoy songs offline. And these are all the features you should be considering for your music streaming app.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. Performance during Internet Variations and Offline Mode</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens to your app when there is no internet?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, even at this internet age there are places in this world where you may not find any internet. And if there is no internet, how are your users going to use your apps?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is simple- offline downloads. With this small feature, you can allow the users to download their songs offline so that they can listen to it even when they are in the middle of the Sahara desert, with no internet.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">F. Personalization- Make It User Specific</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like identity, every user has his own music footprint in terms of artist choices or genre. On-demand playlists can be very effective in this case. It allows the user to pick and play any track from a pre-curated playlist. The recommendations can be made to the user based on his previous choices and preferences. You can add a Tap option to the tracks so that users can smoothly add songs to their favorite playlist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify’s all-new search page shows the albums and artists as per user preference. It is also useful for exploring new music areas and genres as per mood and interests. For any music app creation, you have to have a user-centric UI that appeals to the mass. This user-specific feature will make the users more content with the app and they won’t be moving on to any competitor. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">G. Subscriptions</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with in-app advertisements, subscriptions are one of the ways you can make money with your music streaming app. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can provide app users with free music, with ads at regular intervals. But it should not be too frequent. With a subscription, you can give them ad-free music and access to premium audio content for a monthly payment.</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way is through premium subscriptions. The users pay for ad-free music and access to premium audio content.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">H. Notifications</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When brainstorming about how to make a music app, you may wonder about how to keep people hooked to your music app? Simple, use the power of pushed notifications.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the best way to let the user know when a new track is released or a new offer is available for them. This will keep them engaged with your app.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">I. Live Streaming</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live streaming can be an attractive addition to your music app. Through proper channels, you can stream live concerts and performances of various artists beyond boundaries. This helps in keeping up with the newest music trends and user interests.</span></p>
<h3>J. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Settings</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when it comes to music streaming app, privacy matters. According to </span><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/spotify-still-wont-enable-a-feature-that-would-let-its" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Buzzfeed News, some people might even harass the users of music streaming app using their streaming habits. And that’s why you need to include a privacy setting to make sure that the users feel secure to use your app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not want your certain specific music interest to stick to the “Discover Weekly” playlist, then you can flip into the “Private Session”. For added convenience, it turns off automatically after inactivity of 6 hours. It also protects the privacy of the user in case someone plans on a sneak peek into the app.</span></p>



<h2 id="step2">8. How to Make Your Music App Secure</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because you are making a streaming app doesn’t mean you are going to neglect the matter of security. </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/mobile-app-security-checklist/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of app security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should always be in consideration while making an app. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The login and account details your users are going to enter in your app during registration and subscription is going to be stored in the backend of your app. And you need to take proper security measures for that backend.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The integrated development environment creates the perfect situation for developing an iOS-based application. It is primarily based on source code with basic programming languages like Objective-C , Python and C++ along with many other programming models. It includes basic <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/" target="_blank">iPhone apps development </a>functionalities. It has facilitated the app development process along with various versions. The latest one is  Xcode 8.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Why Xcode Is The Best IDE?</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Xcode takes coding experience to a new level. Run time issues are easier to find. The latest editor extensions, allow you to be completely in charge of the coding experience. The memory debugger takes into account all object graphs. It includes consistent API naming. With the accelerated interface builder, you can customize UI for different classes. While switching between interfaces, you can edit them and get the fastest interface builder. In editor extensions, there are number of things which you can develop. With new templates, there are additional extensions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most common issues faced by the developer is the runtime issue. This latest feature allows developer to find bugs and  fix issues easily. The new thread sanitizer, allows a developer to plot changes in data conditioning. For visual accuracy, Memory Debugger is the best option. The signup process facilitates the updated error messages. It logs in the navigator. Developing the app is similar to an app. It&#8217;s the best way to get an impressive iPhone application. In iPhone apps development, there is always a constant innovation to deliver the best product to customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The strength of Xcode lies in its ingredients with which it contains. It uses advanced languages like C, Objective – C, Python, AppleScript, Swift along with many kinds of programming models. Even there is third party support like Java, Cocoa, and Carbon. They allow the developers to easily adapt themselves to the language and facilitate in iPhone apps development process. Even the latest Xcode 8 comes loaded with an interface builder. Its engineering process makes the software work faster with greater control. As a user, you can switch between devices and adjust all the user interface for the users.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Mastering Xcode With Development Tips</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Xcode, as a new language might come as the latest thing to those iOS developers who have previously worked with Objective C. However, as an iPhone apps development company, we recommend you to focus on the most important elements while working with the Xcode. Take a look at some of the most innovative and useful tips from us, which will help you to master Xcode within few days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Manage Behaviors With Xcode</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know that using behaviors help to automatically perform all the actions seamlessly? If you accidentally make an error or a breakpoint, Xcode opens the debugger windows automatically. It navigates through code in error and throws the editor while synchronizing. Once you move towards preferences, it can even play a sound, show separate navigators and do many things. It depends on your app development process and your capacity to work with behaviors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Work With Simulators</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The device list appearing in the Xcode is easily manageable. Wondering how that’s done? Well, you can access database to verify the tables. Just open the drop down menu. Now, take a look at simulators. You can easily know about all the simulators and the connected devices as well. For adding more simulators, click on ‘+’ button. However, the best practice is to restore all simulators. Another thing to keep in mind here are the app containers. Normally, you access data through the simulator directories. You forget to access them through device.  To access the device, just download the container from tmp directories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Make Readability Easier</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can take advantage of the best plugins to ensure better readability. There are even customized themes. They reflect default presentation. There are many options available when it comes to implementing best code for better readability. Some of them are SCXcodeMinimap, VVDocumenter – Xcode, Lin, and RealmPlugin. You can get various themes within these and apply them according to your requirement during iPhone apps development process. This is  the best way to ease  code readability process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Organize The Files</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to navigate to a source file, then it&#8217;s possible with drop down menu. Click the drop down and many details appears. Moreover, you can open files quickly. Go to the view section first, select Editor, followed by Assistant Editor. Add more flexibility to the website by clicking the file twice. There is no way to use the window for successful implementation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Make Code Snippets</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mostly, time code snippets remains the same again and again. Take  help of smaller snippets  to fill a new collection class. They help to make singleton, GDC calls, and type alias. To make a snippet, open the panel. Now select snippet form and then choose placeholder name. Now, drag code in the snippet area. The debugging process  becomes easier. Use completion shortcut to start the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the Xcode tips mentioned above are effective in mastering Xcode. You can manage them in an effective and efficient manner. Our suggestions will help you to overcome obstructions in iPhone app development process and work with the language easily.</p>

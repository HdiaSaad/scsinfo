										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know that about 30% of the time spent by the developers goes in surfing the source code? The cost of fixing bugs is almost 10 times and 100 times higher in the construction and designing phase respectively. Considering all these <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/want-the-best-web-app-development-use-these-5-javascript-frameworks/">web app development factors</a>, changes have come from time to time to facilitate the process of development. In other words, trends have come to the fore that helped developers to adapt themselves to the latest trends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through this blog, we intend to empower the knowledge of developers or any other code lover who want to keep themselves updated with the latest inclination in the programming industry.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Programming Revolutionizing Our Lives</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The blessings of programming on the human race are immense. It changed our approach to things in everyday life. The great evolution of apps now brings tasks at our fingertips. There is hardly any work left today which doesn’t comply with an application. From development languages to frameworks and development tools, programming underwent a metamorphosis since the last one decade. It is growing rapidly every day with new changes in the client expectation and project execution strategy. Another aspect of programming is that it also includes cloud computing which implements the same programming techniques.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Business is another important area where programming has bestowed its blessings. From the web app development perspective, DevOps, these days are focusing more on the outcomes. They are working closely with the operational team to give meaningful results to every project, which they undertake. Agility and continuous emphasis on development thus remain the two major components in app development. Whether it is PHP or Python, name any programming language today. Each one of them is directly co-related to business. Empowering business websites, extending the functionalities and making agile web apps is the core agenda for any web development company today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two ways of delivering a web app – either as a web application or as a client side application. If you are making an Android based app, you can specify style properties as well as viewport in order to accommodate it on all types of screen. Even defining an interface is now possible with the rise in the technological development happening in the industry. You can also call APIs based on a web application. From debugging to building web apps, programming has ignited the hope of success in web app development since the day of its evolution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest programming trends will act as a guide to DevOps, which they can utilize in their next project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Must To Know Programming Trends</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 1: Rise of Backend Service</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 21st-century programming will primarily focus less on self-managed applications. Rather, it will shift towards using third party services. The benefit will be to handle important aspects of a project in an organized manner. Cloud storage, user administration, and push notifications are some of the things that will come to the fore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rise of BaaS or Backend as a service will become popular and will facilitate the utilities of a web-based application. This will be beneficial from the enterprise point of view where scalability forms a vital part of developing the large-scale application. Now, the operations and engineering teams can compete with their rivals when it comes to delivering the best services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 2: Image Handling Becomes Easier</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With Backend as a service, uploading projects to the cloud or in any other social APIs is easier. But, there are many applications till date which fully rely on the good servers and improved development stacks to function in the best manner possible. Server positioning, on the other hand, becomes too much time consuming and difficult for the developers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Generating images in the machine while working simultaneously with frameworks, languages, libraries and OS help to make containers, this consists of machine images. If your team has not yet adopted or started utilizing it then it’s time to make use of it. The containers also have the ability to create existing services or making a new one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 3: More Dependency On Functional Languages</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest sophisticated applications need more storage capacity, with faster processor requirements and increasing bandwidth. Working with a single machine model makes it cumbersome for a developer to use the systems as the configurations do not match at all. The rise of functional programming has made it mandatory to adapt to new languages for complicated web app development process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Subsequently, there is a need for developers who has the ability to work with such languages. Functional programming, on the other hand, relies heavily on the mutable state. Here, comes the role of a functional language. It has a strong advantage over the normal object-oriented languages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trend 4: More Focus on Material Design</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the early days of web app development and design, flat design is something, which one was dependent upon, as a modern approach to UI design. But, it was the introduction of Material Design in 2016 that shifted the focus completely. It has given some stiff competition to companies like Apple and Microsoft, which heavily relies on flat design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary USPs  of material design is the three-dimensional effect with a lighting design. It gives a completely different depth to the components used digitally. For instance: when you use drop shadows, it enables the user to understand whether the element used in the application is clickable or not. It is expected that there will be a rise in UI design patterns as creative designers continue to embrace material design.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap up!</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Functional languages in web app development play an important role in increasing the user experience. Knowing the latest trends prevailing in the industry will make the DevOps aware about them and implement them successfully in a project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Single page web applications are something, which has no existence without JavaScript. On the other side of the coin, developing interactive web applications using JavaScript is a cliché in the world of fast <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web app development</a>. Hence, the solution is to use JavaScript frameworks. These frameworks act as steroids and powers up HTML and JavaScript. They help developers to focus on the interactive elements, which creates a great user interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Use of Frameworks In Modern Web Development</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contribution of frameworks in this digitally developing world is immense. Previously, writing codes was all about applying knowledge to develop a robust code. But now, the process has changed. Today, most of the codes consist of APIs. Moreover, a number of tools have evolved today to fasten the process of web app development. One of them is a framework. It enables developers to write a generic code. A good framework consists of tool sets, code libraries, application programming interface, compiler and support programs. They help to club together various components required to develop a project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the JavaScript frameworks mainly run MVC designed structure code to ensure reusable and scalable JavaScript Code. However, it is not necessary that such frameworks should solely base on MVC pattern. Variations might change and implement in accordance with the requirements of the project. The best approach is to maintain a proper code structure. Remember, it is difficult to write an excellent code; hence, the smarter way is to run the API according to the requirements of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These days what matter the most is to have a good knowledge of architecture. Apart from making the traditional API calls, optimizing Objective – C compilers will help you to pick the details of the framework rather than the syntax of the language. Most of the time spent goes in making the inner loops of the libraries. A developer can correct the language details after he or she comes to know about the libraries. Make sure that it’s a changed algorithm. Do not stash it inside the variables. The correct way is to know about the various frameworks and applies them wherever required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With advanced JavaScript frameworks, it’s possible to make the most complex single page applications within minutes. We bring to you 5 most robust frameworks that will simplify the process of web app development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5 Most Robust Frameworks For Best Web App Development</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take a look at the most powerful Javascript frameworks, which are an alternative to JavaScript.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AngularJS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Google product, it’s the most popular frameworks till date. With the biggest online communities, it is just the best web app development framework for single page web application. This framework gives powers to HTML by offering all the features, which are necessary to make dynamic views. Two-way data binding gives the ultimate inputs that enable a developer to view the JavaScript objects. Hence, the hectic process of writing manual code for manipulating the DOM is something, which a developer can avoid. Moreover, the recent release of AngularJS 2 has fixed many bugs and issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>React.JS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most common thing between Facebook and Instagram is it’s user interface which consists of  React.JS. The large scalability of the framework makes it the perfect choice for developers to make complex applications. One of the strong points of React.JS is the use of virtual DOM. A virtual domain makes gives a boost to React.JS. One can render it on the server as well as the client side. Other advantages of React.JS include server-side rendering of DOM, comparing the virtual domain with the actual DOM and updated specific nodes of browser domain instead of rendering the entire domain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ember.JS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s an open-source JavaScript framework. When it comes to usability and functionality, it can compete with AngularJS as well as React.js. Its functionality is somewhat similar to AngularJS where a developer can update the model in accordance with the view, thus synchronizing both the model as well as view changes. To enable better UI rendering, and speed up the performance, the server side rendering facility is something, which is already present in this framework. Something similar to React.js. Hence, combining the two-way binding data and server-side rendering, Ember amazes the developers with its super powers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aurelia.js</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is one framework which is suitable for next generation web app development, then it is Aurelia.js. It is an expert professional community and is one of the strongest frameworks to work with. It consists of numerous modules along with small libraries. As a developer, you can use the full framework while executing a project. Select it on the basis of the project and create a customized framework. The strength of the framework is that it has no external dependencies other than polyfills. For all those developers who have worked with AngularJS 2 and its previous versions, this framework comes across as a fantastic migration path.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Meteor.js</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are somebody who wants to utilize JavaScript fully for complete web app development, then Meteor.js is highly recommended. It consists of features as well as elements used in the backend, frontend, managing database management and business logic. This framework enables you to use JavaScript for overall application development process. A number of server-side packages are available. You can run node.js in all most all the packages to access the database. From the performance point of view, any kind of change in the database reflects in the user interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap up!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, a JavaScript framework has become the basis for developing single page web applications. However, there are many frameworks available in the web app development field today, but the use of these five frameworks ensures that the best project delivery goes to the client.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Google has finally developed an optimized framework to increase the size and performance of a web application. Now deploying applications faster across all kinds of platforms starting from mobile to desktops and tablets will become easier. With AngularJS2 &#8211; the upgraded version of AngularJS, this JavaScript framework has now gone a step ahead with improved features, which is specially suited for <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web app development</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Simplifying a developer’s task </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A developer can now independently use third party library; at the same time can also write their own codes. Command line interface along with Angular CLI command, improved router with core APIs are some of the strongest features, which make it the best framework for developers. With more fixed bugs and resolved issues, there is no doubt that this latest version will make the task of a developer less cumbersome.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many other significant improvements in web app development have come to the fore with this release. For instance: the introduction of web workers to simplify web content thus enabling them to run scripts even in backgrounds, the inclusion of more languages to facilitate server-side rendering of apps and many more. Along with this, payload size increase is yet another noteworthy feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six years ago, AngularJS’ introduction for the first time mainly constituted of HTML-based development and dependency injection. These two came into usage for the first time then. Decoupling of the framework from DOM was the primary purpose for which the framework came into usage. Moreover, multiple renderers were also enabled along with Microsoft’s TypeScript.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, from the early stages of web app development to this day, AngularJS has graduated from an amateur framework to a client side MVW framework. Making complicated single page applications easier is the primary purpose of the framework and it does with complete expertise. The USP of the framework is that it places equal importance on testing the application as well as writing it. As a result, it leads to a simpler development process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before getting into any discussion further, let us first understand the need for AngularJS2. To address issues in mobile such as performance and load time, to remove different modules from Angular’s core and to enable the developers to focus on implementing the code. However, many developers have raised concerns regarding the compatibility of this latest framework; however, there won’t be any problem with the robust features of the framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Changes And Updates</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A slew of changes with improved functionalities and capabilities comes in AngularJS2.  AtScript is the latest addition in this version . It has a Traceur compiler, which produces ES5 code. The developer does this with the help of TypeScript’s syntax. The syntax generates runtime type assertions by compiling time checks. On the other hand, you can still use JavaScript code and use it to write the codes for AngularJS based apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now it’s time to take a look at the latest and additional features of AngularJS2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stronger Dependency Injection</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the launch of AngularJS, dependency injection helped it to stand out from various other JavaScript frameworks. Modular development along with component isolation is a major update. The latest version aims to solve all the problems, which were not solved in the previous versions. Moreover, many child injectors have addressed the issues still prevailing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improved Annotations With Injectors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AtScript comes with tools for connecting metadata with other functions. It creates object instances after sending the required information to DI library. Once sent, it checks for any other metadata during a function call. Developers can inject an annotation to override the parameter data. Use child injectors to increase the capability of its parent over the child level. One can call different kinds of objects with various annotations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Binding With Templates</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know that data binding and templates go hand in hand when it comes to overall web app development? With the ‘dynamic loading’ feature, developers can add directives. At the same time, they can also include controllers. The role of templating goes beyond binding. It loads the dependencies only by referencing the component definition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>New Directives</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the latest features of AngularJS2. Three new directives – Component, Decorator and Template Directives drive this. Component Directives makes use of reusable components by including logic in the JavaScript and CSS style sheet. Decorator Directives, on the other hand, shows or hides elements with ng-show/ng-hide. Template Directives, converts HTML to the reusable template.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Convenient Routing Solutions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are someone, who has used AngularJS previously, then you must know about its limited framework features. The recent version comes loaded with an array of features. Take a look below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Location Service</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">404 Route Handling</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Document Title Updates</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Navigation Model (For Generating a Navigation UI)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Query String Support</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simple JSON-based Route Config</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">URL Resolver</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Static, Parameterized and Splat Route Patterns</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Child Router</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary function of a child router is to transform all the components of an application into smaller one with the help of a router. It mainly constitutes of two things – screen activator and design. While screen activator helps to smoothen the navigation lifecycle with a set of callbacks; on the other hand, the design makes it incredibly easier to add steps in the timeline. In order to make a server request, it is necessary to authenticate the user data. In addition to this, the asynchronous nature enables developers to make a good server request.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Logging</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having a good library allows the pluggable modules to create logs without any stack trace. Even when you are working with an object oriented language like JavaScript. It allows a developer to follow the source code by analyzing the diary.js. One can expect that in future, more modifications are going to take place in this framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There has been a lot of buzz in the technology world related to the release of AngularJS2. With its robust features, it will surely make the process of web app development much easier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a time in the computing world when developers used to rely heavily on JavaScript for its usage across the web world for various purposes starting from servers, tablets, computers, HTML and smartphone. The object-oriented programming language used in bilateral qualities in the web browsers. In the subsequent time, the need for more sophisticated <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>web app development</strong></a> software gave birth to advanced programming languages. One of them being CoffeeScript. As an advanced programming language, it makes JavaScript a more polished one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CoffeeScript doesn’t assemble with VM code or binary, however, it takes the source code of JavaScript. So, there are three main USPs of this language that takes it one notch higher than a normal JavaScript programme – straight forward class definitions, whitespace syntax, lambda definitions with easy functioning. Apart from these three, it’s the perfect combination of elements like Python and Ruby, which makes it loaded with many functional features as well.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>CoffeeScript Blessings in Web App Development</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While writing basic codes with programming, CoffeeScript certainly climbs up the ladder with respect to any other languages. As the demand for highly concurrent applications is on the rise, there was a need for using imperative programming styles. CoffeeScript codifies the complexity present in various applications. It comes as a blessing to those  looking for a unified solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Write Easy Conditional Statements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you start using CoffeeScript, don&#8217;t write If/else statements with curly brackets and parentheses. Multi-line conditionals open with indentation. The greatness of this web app development language lies in compiling the if statements to JavaScript with a ternary operator. Don&#8217;t use any ternary statement here.  Just write a regular if statement in a single line and that’s it. CoffeeScript uses significant whitespaces to group those blocks of code; something  similar to that of Python.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Splats for Function</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While working with arguments object JavaScript is a great way to work with variables and functions. CoffeeScript consists of splats for invocation and function. This makes the number of arguments easier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>More Loops With Comprehensions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the loops written in CoffeeScript will consist of comprehensions instead of objects, ranges, and arrays. While comprehensions replace loops with optional guard clauses with the current array index; on the other hand, array comprehensions and applications is assigned. Just keep in mind that comprehensions replace those places with filter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Array Slicing with Ranges</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of ranges cannot be ignored while making slices. If you use two dots, the range becomes inclusive, increasing the dots further excludes the range till the end. Indices with slices have default indices. For instance: if the first index gets omitted, then the default value will be zero. On the other hand, the second index is default in accordance with the size of the array. Use the same syntax to replace the segment with an array of value by slicing it for easy web app development process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Class Definitions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To define a class in JavaScript, it is necessary to define it in a language. It is a type of language, which has very few rules. Unlike any other languages with difficult classes to understand, CoffeeScript is easy to understand the language to define the classes.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Differences Between Coffee Script And JavaScript</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By now you might have known the plenty of benefits which CoffeeScript has to offer.  Now, let’s see the differences between the two web app development programming languages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting from strings to variables, lambdas, and functions, it’s very difficult to carry out such functions with JavaScript. With CoffeeScript, you can implement them in a faster process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many junk codes in JavaScript. Such codes are unnecessary while it comes to communicating the intent for the function&#8217;s usability . On the other hand, CoffeeScript does not have any unnecessary codes which are not actually required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though both the programming languages have same function definitions and variable names, but the former is used more effectively in JavaScript.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Argument definitions and parenthesis are not optional in JavaScript. However, they are optionally used in CoffeeScript.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CoffeeScript codes are small and simple. Unlike JavaScript one’s that are long.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In case of JavaScript, there is a restriction of language by conventions. It can explain the classes through various ways but not through puzzling. In CoffeeScript, this problem is solved with class keyboard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The presence of indentation in CoffeeScript removes the need of applying needless braces. JavaScript, on the other hand, does not make use of white space responsive language at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To sum it up all, CoffeeScript is an advanced version of JavaScript due to its extraordinary ability. Developer can use the core elements of JavaScript to write better and interesting codes. There will be fewer hurdles as far as debugging is concerned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, with so many advantages of CoffeeScript over JavaScript, it would be just apt to say that as far as web app development is concerned, CoffeeScript can replace JavaScript.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We undertake various web projects and work with the latest web technology. CoffeeScript is one of our expertise areas under which we have taken many projects and successfully delivered them as well.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the advent of what is known as the ‘internet,’ HTML is a synonymous name that has been doing the rounds everywhere. Over the years, it has progressed largely and has undergone an immense change. It has created ripples in the world of <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web app development</a> with its interactive application and stunning designs. As far as functionality and syntax improvement is concerned, HTML 5 has provided the boost when it comes to developing a web page. When combined with CSS3, it can result in making the next generation web application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">HTML might not be a new thing to the web today, but big organizations like Google and Microsoft have recently realized the importance of this standard markup language and is harnessing it even in their browsers as per this latest <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/flash-and-chrome/">blog</a> from Google. So, we can say that the transition of the web from a simple text-based document to a modern program based document is something which has provided the perks to the modern world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Features that make HTML5  stronger</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Semantic Elements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s the presence of the semantic elements that make HTML5 capable enough to be used at such a large scale. Now a web page looks much completed due to the presence of elements such as navigation bar, header, and footer. If you have been using the previous versions of HTML, you might have noticed that as a developer, you were required to make use of &lt;div&gt; along with ID or attributes. Now with the help of HTML5, the semantic structure of the document is uniform. One important thing to mention here is that the use of &lt;div&gt; is perfectly valid as you can keep it for future. Some of the primary elements that are used in HTML5 are &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;hgroup&gt;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Canvas Elements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was originally developed by Apple in order to use it in the Mac OS X. It was again adopted by Opera and Mozilla. Later, the element was standardized and added in HTML5. Along with this, 2D drawings were included in the APIs, which were in turn used in making texts, animations, and transitions. Most of the people believe that canvas element is an important part of HTML, but it doesn’t prove to be of much help in web app development. APIs is an intelligent option to make use of. With the help of an API, a developer can draw shapes, apply a colour of the desired choice and transform the canvas objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Web Enhancements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You must be familiar with HTML’s controls. We’re talking here about the basic input functions here such as file, checkbox, radio, submit text and image. One interesting feature about HTML5 is that it has two stunning features – Autofocus and Placeholder attribute. While the first one instructs the browser to focus on the particular form field, on the other hand, the later enables the developer to enhance text when all the contents are empty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the above-mentioned features of HTML5, there are plenty of other features such as web worker, geo-location, cross document messaging, drag and drop and much more that make this scripting language the best option for web app development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Setting Benchmarks With CSS3 Features</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There have been new additions in the latest version of CSS, which make it the favorite among the developers. It is by far the most wonderful update. The latest versions have come up with a new set of advanced features such as new selectors, negation pseudo classes and state based selectors. A number of effects have been made available in various image formats starting from PNG to GIF and JPEG. Some of the features are widely being used as all other networks are degraded easily in other web browsers. They are similar to that of a newspaper layout where the text is stretchable over the columns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Adjust Multicolumn Layouts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the help of multicolumn layouts, you can effectively manage the property of column gap. This will help the developer to expressively define the space where the column width method will be used. Not only this-this will also enable him or her to make use of the border style in between columns.  Currently, multi-column layouts are supported in both Mozilla and Webkit. Currently, they are implemented with temporary proprietary. The perfect decision is to move the browsers to CSS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Web Fonts For Better Results</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know that the usage of web fonts was out forward for CSS2? However, it could not be implemented at that point in time as there was a need for a proprietor and there were no browser vendors at that moment who would be able to distribute the web fonts. The latest versions of all browsers starting from Mozilla to Firefox and Chrome, a developer can make use of the @font-face on the web page. One important thing to keep in mind here is that these fonts are used as images. You can either pay for them or can also make use of the royalty free web fonts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Supporting New Features</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a host of other features, which make CSS3, the preferable web app development tool. Its support for new colour values like RGBA and HSLA are the unique features, which help the developers to handle media queries. For instance: as a developer, you can mention styles for devices, which has less than 500 pixels. The speech module enables you to adjust specific properties of a screen reader such as balance, stress and voice volume.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both HTML5 and CSS3 prove as a support to each other when it comes to developing the most modern web apps. They are inseparable and is making a big breakthrough in the web app development world. All the important mobile platforms today use either android or iOS and any other WebKit-based browsers, hence it is evident that CSS3 and HTML5 will prove to be of greater benefit. All the major browser vendors are increasingly making use of HTML5 plugins instead of using the plugins of Adobe Flash.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Gone are the days when developing a web application meant spending endless hours behind writing complicated codes. The new age coding is full of fun and is more expressive. It is something that is creating more interest among the web developers. Programming has been through several changes since it’s beginning, when it was merely used as a C language in web app development. The presence of technology today acts as a catalyst in implementing a complex idea into simplified solution with powerful web application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone is obsessed to be at the front end when it comes to leading the race amongst so many <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/"><strong>website design and development companies</strong></a> that are slowly coming up across everywhere. As far as the PHP frameworks are concerned, Laravel is the first preference of the developers and it equips them with a strong weapon to develop large-scale web applications with an extensive use of powerful coding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Empowering Web Apps To The Core</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best programming results come when there is a strong framework and Laravel acts as a catalyst in infusing more power in a web application. The web app development speed of the frame work along with improved scalability and the presence of multiple powerful tool makes it the best programming tool that a developer has ever used. It can be termed as ‘a power booster tool’ in developing all the web applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is how it’s done…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Simplifying Template Engine:</strong> Laravel comes loaded with built in lightweight templates. These help the developers to make beautiful layouts that come with dynamic content seeding. The use of JS and CSS codes in the widgets makes this framework equipped with solid structures. Hence, if you want to make a web application with simple layout and multiple section, then <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-laravel-eases-the-process-of-web-development/">Laravel is the most appropriate framework for you</a> to use in web app development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Easy Project Handling With Artisan:</strong> Artisan is a command line tolls that comes with Artisan and is very effective in working with any kind of project environment. The benefit of such tool is that it performs the major programming tasks that most of the developers tend to avoid. Other unique benefits of Laravel include creating a skeleton code, managing the structure of database and creating their migration to another place. Not only this, a developer can also send MVC files with the help of command line. This can in turn help to manage the assets along with their configurations. Last but not the least, Laravel enables developers to perform unit tests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Faster Object Relational Mapping:</strong> Instead of undergoing the hassle of writing SQL codes, Laravel allows the developer to issue database queries with the help of PHP syntax. This is done with the help of ORM or Object Relational Mapping, which consists of a PHP ActiveRecord Implementation. The presence of Object Oriented libraries are one of the unique things in Laravel. You will not find it any other kind of PHP frameworks. The pre authentication library is easy to implement and includes the most sophisticated features such as Cross-site Request Forgery Protection, encryption, Bcrypt hashing, password reset and the facility of checking active users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Latest Modular With Great MVC support:</strong> Do you know that Laravel is built on 20 libraries which is sub divided into many modules? Yes, this another great feature of the framework. It is due to the presence of these modern PHP elements that makes this framework to make robust web applications, which are responsive and handy. The MVC architecture provides yet another strong support. It improves the performance of the web app thereby allowing better documentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Better Migration For Databases:</strong> Whenever you are using Laravel, you do not have to recreate the database structure of the application again and again. This amazing framework allows you to expand the database structure without the risk of losing the web app development data. Apart from helping the developers to change the structure of the database, it also helps them to make use of PHP code instead of writing SQL code. ‘Laravel Schema Builder’ is an important feature that enables developers to make database tables and enter columns with indices easily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Facilitating Unit Testing:</strong> Now, Unit Testing is the reason why developers love to use Laravel. It conducts thousands of tests in order to ensure that any modifications or changes done by developers do not disturb the structure of the web application. Moreover, you can also take the help of this framework to write your own codes for unit testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Rapid Prototyping With Laravel</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laravel can be an excellent tool that can team up with any kind of framework and result in rapid prototyping. Well, BootStrap makes it possible in just three simple steps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here we go</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 1: Make Wireframes </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before prototyping it is important to sketch a wireframe in order to get a rough idea of how the application is going to look like finally. Making wireframe or project mockups will help you to will not only ensure that you have a great web application plan, in fact it can also save a considerable amount of money, thus resulting in cost benefit analysis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 2: Start Using Bootstrap</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Install Bootstrap in your system. Doing this will help you to prepare a responsive layout, maintain consistency and design the web application in an easier manner. Bootstrap also consists of many JavaScript components such as Modal windows, tabs, toolpits, carousel and collapsible elements. In order to install Bootstrap in your project, install the bower and the npm file of bootstrap first. It would be better if you can use BootstrapCDN</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 3: Choose Theme And Start Coding</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the last and final step. Here, you can choose a theme and use the existing code in order to prototype.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to give you a clear overview on how Laravel facilitates in rapid prototyping, we present you a video.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" style="height: 600px !important;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylY6Gxw0bDo" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Wrap up!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as enterprise application development is concerned, Laravel has a bright future ahead. It’s simplicity and easy to use features make it the most popular framework among the developers. Whether it is about managing the work interface workflow or the need to make responsive web design, Laravel can easily accommodate itself in any kind of environment used in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web app development</a>.</p>

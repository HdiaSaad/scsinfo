										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best time of the year is here again! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I’m not saying it because of Christmas or New Year&#8217;s Eve. Those are too mainstream now! At </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/"><b>Unified Infotech</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we have a separate fanbase for the Unified Premier League (UPL). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, just like Football and Cricket World Cup, every year, the UIPL family eagerly waits for this cricket tournament. And the most-loving fact is that we don’t even have to wait for 4 years for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, on 28th December 2019, Saturday, our UIPL family witnessed the most-awaited cricket tournament of our organization. And with high team spirit and sheer skills and excellence, </span><b>Fire Hunks won the UPL 2019 Cup</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, if you are thinking UPL is like just another random employee recreational activity, let me correct you! The emotions, passions, dedications, and excitement attached to UPL is nothing less than the World Cup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me take you through the journey of the Unified Premier League (UPL). And you’ll know how much UPL means to the UIPL family. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Planning Warm-Up </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not like we just plan things within one week and head out to play. Every successful organization plans well before taking one-step. And for UPL, we do the same. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11592" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11592" style="width: 1603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11592 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Match-Day-UPL.jpg" alt="The Match Day UPL" width="1603" height="1241" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Match-Day-UPL.jpg 1603w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Match-Day-UPL-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Match-Day-UPL-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Match-Day-UPL-1024x793.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1603px) 100vw, 1603px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11592" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of the year, we decide on which day the Unified Premier League is going to take place. And accordingly, we book the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But organizing a cricket tournament is much more than that. We have to print flex and banners, prepare cup and medals for the winning team players. Also, there are food and drink arrangements for everyone including the players and the spectators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything needs well-organized planning. So, for that, we build a committee that takes care of all these. This committee also takes care of all the necessary cricket equipment too.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Teams</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have four cricket teams.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fire Hunks</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On the RockX</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pitch Smashers</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified Super Kings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each team has 9 players. A total of 7 cricket matches are there. And each game is of 10 overs.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, not everyone can join the team. We enlist the names of interested candidates. Then they go through months of training and practice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may wonder how everyone gets so much time! Well, that’s the spirit of UIPL family. Everyone gives their best efforts and dedication to the work. And after that, they manage time to do exercise and play practice matches as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, team captains are selected by votes. And then team players are chosen through the UPL auction. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battle Day</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">28th December 2019, Saturday</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shivering cold. Chilly and foggy weather. Yes, that’s how the early morning of 28th December of 2019 was. But the game was on!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reporting time to reach the ground was 7.30 am. And the game spirit defeated the cold and chilly weather. Every player reached the ground by sharp 7.30 am. And the game was about to start by sharp at 8 am. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Game Is On</span></h3>
<p><b>1st Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tournament’s favorite team </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the RockX</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> played the 1st match. And the game ended with a shock! The tournament’s favorite team lost to its opponent. </span></p>
<p><b>2nd Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second match was between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defeated the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the game. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, I would love to mention one name i.e. Israfil, one of our very skilled developers. We all knew about his coding skills, but we got to know about his commentary skills on the match day. It wouldn’t have been the same without his hilarious commentary during the matches. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11601 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-2.jpg" alt="Prize Distribution" width="1920" height="1039" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-2.jpg 1920w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-2-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-2-768x416.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-2-1024x554.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breakfast Time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the end of the 2nd match, the ambiance was entirely set. Most of the spectators reached the ground at that time. More interestingly, many outsiders were also enjoying the cricket tournament. So, everyone was on the vibes of the Unified Premier league.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breakfast packets were served to everyone after the 2nd match. I saw </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were having breakfast with their respective team players. Maybe they were talking about strategies! Because 3rd match was between these two teams only. And to keep their hopes alive to play the final, they had to win this match anyhow.</span></p>
<p><b>3rd Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the 3rd match started with so many spectators cheering for both teams on the ground. And the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> literally smashed the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our Marketing Team’s Tanmay gave an amazing performance in the match with 47 runs. </span></p>
<p><b>4th Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By winning the 4th match against </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the RockX</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went straight into the Final under the brilliant captaincy of Partha, one of our beloved and experienced designers. </span></p>
<p><b>5th Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the deciding match for who is going to be the other finalist between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the RockX</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And with a killer performance of the team, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won the match and became the 2nd finalist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanmay got injured during this match. But with the great sportsman spirit and with the help of the doctor we had in the ground, he continued playing. And he confirmed he would play in the final as well. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Final Phase of The Cricket Tournament</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we had two most deserving finalists of the tournament &#8211; the unbeaten </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the team that continually won every match after their first loss, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had another cricket match between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the RockX</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to decide who is going to take the third place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before these two remaining matches, lunch was served to everyone. After the breathtaking matches, the lunch seemed the most delicious thing we ever had. The tournament management committee arranged for finger-licking chicken dish with roti and soft energy drinks for everyone present in the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, after lunch, we were all set for the final phase of the cricket tournament. </span></p>
<p><b>6th Match for the 3rd Place</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the last chance for the team </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get the feeling of victory for once in the tournament. The team On the RockX didn’t take their opponent lightly just because they didn&#8217;t win any game so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many tensed supporters around them, the game started. However, it seemed luck didn’t work for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unified Super Kings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that day. And after giving a tough fight, they lost to their opponent team. And we got our UPL’s 3rd place winner </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the RockX</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Final Match of Unified Premier League (UPL)</span></h2>
<p><b>Fire Hunks vs Pitch Smashers </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was super excited about the final because two of the most deserving teams were playing it. With spectators cheering and clapping, the match started. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won the toss. And the captain chose to field first. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11597 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-29.jpg" alt="Prize Distribution" width="1093" height="1676" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-29.jpg 1093w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-29-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-29-768x1178.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-29-668x1024.jpg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 1093px) 100vw, 1093px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had some great batsmen who were already on form and did well in the previous matches. Everyone was looking forward to witnessing some great batting from the team captain Abhishek. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, things didn’t go really well for them. Abhishek got out on a full toss delivery by the opponent team captain Partha! When the situation became tense, Tanmay and Rajat, another skilled and experienced developer of our UIPL family showed their expertise on the ground.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11595 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/one-of-our-man-of-the-matches-762x1024.jpg" alt="Prize Distribution" width="762" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/one-of-our-man-of-the-matches-762x1024.jpg 762w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/one-of-our-man-of-the-matches-223x300.jpg 223w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/one-of-our-man-of-the-matches-768x1032.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/one-of-our-man-of-the-matches.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their partnership helped </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitch Smashers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to score 90 runs in 10 overs. So, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had to do 91 runs in 10 overs to win the cup. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started the match with a bit slow-paced runs. It was almost 5 pm. So, the ground was becoming kinda wet with dew. Thus, doing batting became a bit tough for the players of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They had to do 47 runs from 36 balls.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11599 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-21-1-935x1024.jpg" alt="Prize Distribution" width="935" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-21-1-935x1024.jpg 935w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-21-1-274x300.jpg 274w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-21-1-768x841.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-21-1.jpg 1121w" sizes="(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a bit of drama, the finale is never exciting. And this year’s UPL final didn’t disappoint anyone present on the ground. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11600 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-18-846x1024.jpg" alt="Prize Distribution" width="846" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-18-846x1024.jpg 846w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-18-248x300.jpg 248w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-18-768x929.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DCS001-18.jpg 1058w" sizes="(max-width: 846px) 100vw, 846px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things became really tense when </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had to do 13 runs from 10 balls. With 3 wickets in hand, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needed 8 runs to win from 7 balls. Nobody was sure what would happen. And that’s the beauty of cricket! </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11594 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cricket-pic-2-min.png" alt="Prize Distribution" width="1650" height="1276" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won the match in a legendary style! Subhajyoti, one of our talented Project Managers hit the winning 6. And with 3 wickets in hand and 5 balls remaining, the team won the </span><b>Unified Premier League 2019 Cup</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awards and Awestruck Moments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Champions hold the cup high in their hands! </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Hunks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remained unbeaten till the end of the tournament. For the brilliant performance in the final match, Santu, a talented developer in our UIPL family, won the award for “The Man of the Match”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, we all spent an eventful day. We took a lot of photos together. And we made great memories together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How important employee recreational activities are in an organization needs no special mention. In today’s busy world, managing the work-life balance has become pretty tough for almost everyone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such a scenario, such activities and events are like a breath of fresh air. It reduces the stress of work pressure, makes the workplace interesting and better. Also, it is great for improving team morale in the workplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why I would like to say a big thanks to our event planning committee for arranging such a big and successful cricket tournament.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the festive time is not over yet. We have our official picnic in the next few days. Surely, I will share the fun and interesting stories and moments of our picnic soon. </span></p>

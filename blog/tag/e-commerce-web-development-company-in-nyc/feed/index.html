										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Can you feel the love in the air? If not, you must be feeling sales opportunities are floating around you in this seasonal love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A normal of £980 million was spent on Valentine&#8217;s day in the UK in 2017 (worldwide data) and as indicated to some, Valentine&#8217;s Day is viewed as the second-busiest holiday purchasing season of the year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the general holiday marketing rules instructs us to never, ever ignore a holiday. It would be a huge mistake ignoring Valentine&#8217;s day since you&#8217;re not in a jewelry or flower business. As long as you come up with a decent marketing strategy, nearly everything becomes ‘gift-able’.</p>
<h3><strong>Not certain of how to begin with your marketing campaign for Valentine&#8217;s Day?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;ve arranged a couple of tips to enable you to emerge from your competitors and engage with your audience in an unexpected way, to get your business measurable outcomes:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1.  Market Early in a Smart Way</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Try not to hold up until the last moment to begin your marketing! As per insights, a month isn&#8217;t too soon, though showcasing seven days before could be somewhat risky. Furthermore, consider focusing on last-minute shoppers in the prior week before 14th of February.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember to show delivery due dates on requests to guarantee to land on or by the special day. Offering or proposing gift-wrapping could be an incredible method to separate yourself from your rivals too.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2.  Understand Valentine’s Day Buyer Trends</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most importantly, comprehend your store&#8217;s inventory and recognize which items might be appropriate for a Valentine&#8217;s Day buy. Once you&#8217;ve figured this out, you now have a rundown of items to push with your marketing campaign.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Less planning goes into Valentine&#8217;s Day shopping which implies that almost 50% of customers intend to shop during early February. Despite everything, you have a lot of time to get your marketing plans in place. Cart abandonment rates are particularly high amid Valentine&#8217;s shopping (76% for Retail and 86% for Travel). Make sure to execute cart abandonment solutions that will enable you to increase sales conversion during this period.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3.  Add a V-Day Section on Your Website</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your first objective is to make a dedicated Valentine&#8217;s section on your website, to showcase the scope of products with direct navigation for &#8216;gifts for Her&#8217; and &#8216;gifts for Him&#8217;, as it could simplify further product searches. The second objective is to showcase products in an appealing and romantic way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the pre-Valentine&#8217;s Day shopping period the challenge is to connect with your clients by being useful and reducing shopping stress. While advising your customers to purchase your items could be viewed as somewhat strong, you could boost them by incorporating your products in a blessing guide that causes them find inspiration. Likewise, it never neglects to utilize additional offering focuses like a free 24-hour delivery or a 10% off voucher, or even a small gift like a chocolate bar with any purchase.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4.  Emails for Lead Generation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Email marketing is a powerful tool for engagement and customer acquisition. For Valentine&#8217;s e-mails, you ought to incorporate something imaginative that will start your customer&#8217;s advantage: Valentine&#8217;s gifts, seasonal outfits, tips on the most proficient method to pick the ideal present or creative gift-wrapping tutorials. Your plan ought to be topical. The Call-To-Action should stand out in the email, so users can discover it easily.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5.  Provide Shoppers with Gift Ideas</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most Valentine&#8217;s Day shoppers are searching for ideas and have next to no direction on what to buy for their loved one. Here&#8217;s an open door for some seasonal content marketing that focuses on the Valentine&#8217;s Day items that you&#8217;ve officially identified.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Set up together a series of blog entries or a downloadable buying guide loaded with various gift ideas for men, ladies, pets, and companions. Make sure to link to your items so customers can quickly buy from you when they discover a gift idea they like.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">6.  Cross-Sell and Upsell Relevant Products</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Valentine&#8217;s Day customers aren&#8217;t hoping to hold back on gifts which implies that cross-sells and upsells can be an incredible system for expanding order size. 39% of Valentine&#8217;s Day customers anticipate spending over $50 on their better half so this looks good for this promotional tactic.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">7.  Offer Free Shipping</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If one thing emerges to a customer during their visit, it&#8217;s the possibility of free shipping. If you can offer it, at that point ensure you connect with customers with a promotion expressing that you offer free shipping.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Can&#8217;t offer free shipping on all orders? Execute a free shipping threshold. A free delivering edge enables organizations to set a minimum order value that free transporting will be advertised. For instance, if it&#8217;s financially practical for you to offer free transporting on requests of $100 or all the more, at that point set your free shipping threshold at $100.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another approach to building normal request esteem is to set your free sending edge somewhat higher than your normal order size. If my average order is $55, at that point I&#8217;ll set free delivering to $75!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">8.  Social Native Advertising</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Did you realize that 71% of clients settle on buy choices on social media referrals? Focus on your Valentine&#8217;s Day clients with Social Media Native Advertising. It&#8217;s an intense route for organizations of all sizes to achieve customers without disturbing their browsing xbackground. The majority of the interpersonal organizations give you a full scope of focusing on choices like &#8220;gender&#8221;, &#8220;age&#8221;, &#8220;life event&#8221;, &#8220;relationship status&#8221;, and numerous others, so it&#8217;s very simple to send your message to the correct gathering of people. You can support your deals by focusing on a larger number of men than ladies, as they spend twice as much on presents.</p>

Once you have your new cards set up, utilize this as a chance to catch a minute ago stragglers. Send them an email after typical shipping due dates have gone to tell them it&#8217;s not very late to send a &#8220;wrapped&#8221; occasion blessing. At long last, on Christmas morning, including your e-present cards up front on the landing page for those genuinely a last-minute shopper!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">6. Free Delivery</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spruce up deals with a 12% change in basket abandonment rates and up to 8% more things included the primary spot. Offer free conveyance temporarily toward the start of December to make a feeling of urgency. Then again, offer free delivery to clients who spend a specific amount.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">7. Free Returns in-store</h3>

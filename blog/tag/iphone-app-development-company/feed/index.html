										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We are all aware of terms like ‘mobile app development,’ ‘mobile app developer’ and ‘apps,’ but how many of us know the process, which an app goes through before it, is finally installed in a user’s phone? Well, as the end user of an app, you might say that it might not be any of our business to know this. But, there is a very interesting process that an app undergoes before it goes live on any play store. Whether it is for android or <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/" target="_blank">iPhone app development</a>, this process is universally followed across the world irrespective of the industry and the users of the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Impact of mobile apps in our lives and businesses</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With every latest version, the popularity of an app increases. Mobile app developers deploy the most state-of-the-art technologies to develop the most innovative apps. The intensity of mobile app and its utility has increased manifold. From doing household chores to initiating transactions and multiple functions, there is hardly any task left to perform by it. Name a task and an app can perform without any hassles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The blessing of science and technology has resulted in such a technological splurge that today it is next to impossible to live without a mobile and to survive without an app. It’s a clear fact that the benefits which an app can deliver is far better than the benefits of a webiste.  So, even before you start developing an app or approach the designer for making the wireframe of the app, you need to have a clear idea about five things – Target market, visualizing the architecture of the app, deciding the budget, estimating a time frame within the delivery date of the app and users expectations from the company. However, it might sound an uphill task to develop an app but following some simple processes can really be helpful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from creating a bigger user database, an app can successfully help to market your business. It helps to grow a brand in the near future. It’s a great way to monetize your business with the help of in store app purchases. Even while it comes to managing the internal business process like project management, a mobile app is just the best way to monitor a project. Through this blog we are going to share with you some of the behind the scenes situations or stages which an app development company has to go through before finally delivering an app to the client. It will help you to understand the full app development process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Brief stages of iPhone App Development</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let us now go through the brief process of developing an iPhone App</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stage 1: Team Consultation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have given your nod to the project, sit down with your team members. This includes the developers, designers or<br />
any other members. Have a brief discussion about the requirements of the project. Evaluate the requirements and<br />
expectations of the clients and see whether you have a capable team who can handle the project. If you are confident of the<br />
skill set of the team members proceed only then.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stage 2: Contract Signing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the most important stages in iPhone app development. When you undertake a project have a full knowledge of what you are signing. Make sure that the contract is a Non Disclosure Agreement. It is important to keep your idea locked and prevent it from getting leaked. Moreover, keep in mind, about the payment procedure. Choose a time based model or a flat fee approach according to the requirements of your iPhone app development company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stage 3: Preparing Wireframe </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the project initiation, a basic wireframe of the mobile app is necessary. Prepare a visual architecture of the mobile application. It will be helpful for both the developers as well as designers. Ask the client to give you a full wireframe of the project. Once you have the architecture with you, you can understand the scope of the project and start working on the mobile app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stage 4: Designing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you get the approval about the wireframe, the next stage is designing. Here, the designer creates  mock-ups of mobile apps. This includes preparing the .psd files. It gives a rough idea of the final  app. It includes colours, fonts and styling, of the mobile app.  The designers prepare layouts of each individual page here according to the client’s requirements. Once the client is happy with the designing part, one can move to the next stage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stage 5: All Round Development</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The client gets constant updates about the status of the work with the help of a project management tool. If you encounter any problems while developing the app, take all the clarifications from the client at this stage. Once the problems are solved, the iPhone app development tool then proceeds and works on the next milestone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stage 6: Testing </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also known as beta testing or user testing, this is one of the most important stages in developing a mobile app. Testers receive a developer’s version of the app and starts testing it. They look for bugs or issues which stops the mobile apps from running. After identifying the crashes, testers give it to the developers to solve the issues. Always keep in mind that while making a development contract with the client, the testing clause needs complete clarification from the client.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stage 7: App Launch</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the name suggests, app launch mainly includes publishing the app in the app store. It might take few days for the app stores to approve the app. Apple or Google App store manually reviews each app submission. Once, the app satisfies all their terms and conditions, the app is live. Hence, as an iPhone app development company, it is important to be patient and wait till the approval process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stage 8: Post App Launch Service</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the app is live and is consistently used, the client might ask some post app launch services. This might include including new features in the subsequent versions or solving minor bugs within the apps. One should always be welcome to make any changes as demanded by the client.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much-hyped Apple Watch also unveiled itself at Flint Center, Cupertino, CA. According to the rumors wearable was named iWatch, but Apple opted to use their symbol () followed by &#8220;Watch&#8221; for the device&#8217;s name as &#8211;  Watch<br />
A fashionable watch but not an analog nor digital rather it runs with Apple Intelligence. It is available in two sizes of 38mm and 42mm with six different casing material and six interchangeable bands. It comes in three latest edition – Simple, Sport and Edition and would be available in the marketing by 2015, and the price will resume @$349.<br />
<a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/iphone-6-iwatch-one-last-rumor-round/" target="_blank">iWatch designed to pair with an iPhone to function</a>. Apple says it is not a standalone device because it depends on iPhone for many features such as sending or receiving notifications. It can sync with Apple&#8217;s new Continuity features and help users shift task from one user to another.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>Let us take a quick look at the features of this sensational watch from Apple-</h4>
<ul>
<li>1. iWatch may be ion-strengthened or would sport a sapphire display</li>
<li>2. Includes an HD Retina display, sapphire-covered sensors built into the zirconia backing</li>
<li>3. In-built NFC chip to work seamlessly with the Apple Pay mobile payment system</li>
<li>4. Created the interface keeping end-user customization in mind</li>
<li>5. Apps on the design organize themselves into a unique cluster for quick access</li>
<li>6. Apple Watch would take advantage of the &#8220;Digital Crown&#8221; located on the right side that will help users to zoom, scroll, and select elements. The Digital Crown also serves as a Home button</li>
<li>7. And second physical button below Digital Crown allows to communicate with friends easily or send quick messages, animated emoji, heart beat or drawings</li>
<li>8. With new pressure-sensing technology, Apple Watch can distinguish between a tap and a press, thus allow specific controls and relays notification in a subtle manner</li>
<li>9. In-built sensors allow iWatch to measure metrics such as steps taken calories burnt and pulse rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above features would satiate <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/" target="_blank">iOS app developers</a> as it supports intricate functions to make fascinating apps that would be seamless and productive for this all-new Apple product.</p>
<h3>Look &amp; Feel</h3>
<p>()Watch, is a simple device, round on the corners with a rectangular body comes in two separate sizes (38 and 42mm) and has an array of interchangeable bands. To please different tastes Apple designed the watches with custom alloys of stainless steel and aluminum in two finishes and two formulations.</p>
<h5>Six Intelligently Designed Bodies for Apple Watch</h5>
<ul>
<li>1. Stainless Steel</li>
<li>2. Space Black Stainless Steel</li>
<li>3. Silver Aluminum</li>
<li>4. Space Gray Aluminum</li>
<li>5. 18-karat gold</li>
<li>6. 18-karat rose gold.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Apart from the designer bodies, Apple Watch also offers six customized band options.</h5>
<ul>
<li>a. Link Bracelet – resembles traditional watch bands</li>
<li>b. Sports Band – made of lightweight fluoroelastomer</li>
<li>c. Leather Loop – made of handcrafted leather</li>
<li>d. Modern Buckle – use of Granada leather and a magnetic buckle</li>
<li>e. Classic Buckle &#8211; made from Dutch leather and traditional buckle</li>
<li>f. Milanese Loop – made from metal mesh band</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Apple will be only selling watch in their standard configurations or might sell the casing if users express interest. Whether they will sell the bands separately, it is yet unknown.</p>
<h3>Apple Watch-Regular</h3>
<p>Available in two colors precisely Silver and Space Black paired with stainless steel casing. A durable watch, scratch resistant, combined with six available bands. You can get a Link Bracelet in stainless steel and space black stainless steel while the Modern Buckle will be available in brown, soft pink, and midnight blue. Watches made by cold forging process to make the watch more resistant to nicks and corrosion.</p>
<h3>Apple Watch-Sport</h3>
<p>Apple Sport collection is for the fitness enthusiasts. It does not have the cool sapphire display rather lightweight alumina-silicate Ion-X glass to resist scratches. It combines with lightweight anodized aluminum casing in silver or space gray. It comes with fluoroelastomer durable and stronger than rubber bands and comes in vibrant colors such as white, blue, green, pink, and black.</p>
<h3>Apple Watch &#8211; Edition</h3>
<p>The luxury watches features casing made of 18-karat yellow or rose gold. Apple has used their metallurgists to design the Gold Edition watches and it is twice as hard as standard gold to make it scratch resistant. Edition collection marks the use of a polished sapphire crystal display paired with Sport Band, Modern Buckle, and Classic Buckle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The big day is almost here, 8 hours left before the Grand launch of Apple iPhone 6 and iWatch at 10 A.M. (PDT). Prior to Tuesday’s event, we wanted to do the one last rumor roundup of plausible Apple devices that make its way on September 9. It was one of the big weeks of the year in the tech industry, with Apple fanatics holding high expectation with the grand release. Moreover, this year the company is going to announce even more iThings than they ever did.<br />
Apple Inc always keeps their mouth shut ahead of the product announcements, so air of rumor builds up months ahead of the event. It was the same this year, so we thought to list the loudest whispers, just for you –<br />
<strong>Watch the Event Streamed Live</strong><br />
No, this is not a rumor! But definitely, it is going to make and break all the high anticipations that build up in this few months. The event would start streaming at 1 PM Eastern on September 9, as Apple CEO Tim Cook takes the center-stage of Flint Center in Cupertino, CA. (30 years before Steve Jobs released Mac at this same place) People can watch the event streamed live, directly broadcasted from Apple’s Official Site: www.apple.com/live.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 300;"><strong>iPhone 6</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Two Models</strong><br />
Well, Apple is going to launch a pair of iPhone’s, a 4.7-inch version and a 5.5-inch version. For users with small hands, developers say to have one-handed mode that rejiggers interface to help users get everything in reach, you can find a similar feature in the larger phones of Samsung.<br />
Whereas, 5.5 inch is going to facilitate users with expanded display, which can be of great help to apps enlisting themselves in an iPad fashion with the use of iOS8 dual-pane feature.<br />
Rumors about Launch: 4.7-inch version might release first, prior to 5.5-inch version that would come later in this year. As for recent launches, iPhone would be typically available for a couple of weeks that means 4.7 inch would roll for some time in September.<br />
<strong>Designs</strong><br />
The new iPhone is going to sport curvier designs than their previous models, would have tap-to-pay features, 128 gigabytes of storage (current models have 64 gigabytes of storage) and a built-in barometer that ties with the health and location apps.<br />
<strong>Sapphire Glass Display</strong><br />
There have been rumblings about sapphire crystal display in iPhone 6. A hard material of sapphire often used for watch faces is durable and resistant to scratches. Back in January, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed about the use of Sapphire Glass display, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the screens are not yet ready for large displays. He thinks it might line up in the much-anticipated iWatch. (Ming, just few more hours left to see the real, so let us wait)</p>
<div style="width: 77%; margin: 0 auto;"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/R4-YdC5N6Lo?rel=0" width="853" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<h2 style="font-weight: 300;"></h2>
<h2 style="font-weight: 300;"><strong>iWatch (Original Product Name not Yet Leaked by Apple)</strong></h2>
<p>Apple will also pull out from their bag long anticipated Smartwatch, the first wearable device from Apple. However, rumors tell that it would not be available for purchase until next year. Apple is famous for making products available in weeks after unveiling, but with this new release, they have adopted a different strategic approach. iPhone had a curtain raiser six months earlier and iPad came out two months earlier giving time to develop apps. And for iWatch the strategy remains the same.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 300;"><strong>Exclusive Features (Apparently Guessed)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>1. Curved or round curve or rectangular screen</li>
<li>2. Made of scratch resistant material sapphire crystal</li>
<li>3. Tap-to-pay functionality</li>
<li>4. Storage of eight gigabytes</li>
<li>5. Health-tracking sensors</li>
<li>6. Available in two screen sizes</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple shared no word about the pricing of iWatch; however, the market guesses an apparent price of $400.<br />
This was the small briefing of the rumors on air since last few months, now it is time to stay calm and wait for the <strong>Grand Curtain Raiser of iPhone6 and iWatch</strong> (or whatever it may be called)</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At WWDC, Apple surprised developers announcing their new programming language Swift to develop apps across Apple’s platforms.</p>
<p>To date it was Objective-C, the subsequent language used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" target="_blank">NeXT</a> (company founded by Steve Jobs) and then by Apple. However, in 2014 Objective-C finally had to face someone to supersede it with modern and safer features.</p>
<p><strong>How powerful is the new language? What changes can it introduce in the global community of Apple product developers?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>iOS SWIFT – A Small Introduction to the New Craze<br />
</strong><br />
Swift as we know is the new language from the house of Apple for iOS and OS X apps. Previously they used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_c" target="_blank">Objective-C</a>, but now Apple thought to turn safer with the launch of a spanking new programming language and add contemporary features that would make programming easier and flexible. A clean slate, mature Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks would be the perfect maneuver for software development.</p>
<p>Apple has been developing the language for a long time by making advancement in these areas –</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Making changes in the existing compiler, debugger, and framework infrastructure.</li>
<li>2. Apple developers have simplified the Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).</li>
<li>3. Changes in the framework stack, built on the solid base of Foundation and Cocoa by modernizing and standardizing the feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was Objective-C that has worked earlier on support blocks, collection literals, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/an-instant-guide-to-programming-languages-for-website-development/" target="_blank">allowing framework adoption of modern technologies in programming language</a> and adoption of various modules. Therefore, this groundwork has largely contributed to developing new programming language.<br />
Swift is friendly to developers as it is expressive and would not be a problem for the earlier Objective-C with Swift code and generate results immediately. It is better to say that Swift is a powerful combination of modern languages such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C#</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Python</a> with certain tweaks to make it more advanced and “swift”. It has optimized the compiler to perform, improved language for development, designed to scale from “hello, world” to the entire operating system.</p>
<p><strong>New Improved Features Making Swift a Game-Changer</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>Modernized</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Latest research shows that the new language from Apple retains the named parameters of Objective-C, but in a more clean syntax that makes APIs in Swift easy to maintain and read.<br />
var sortedStrings = sorted(stringArray) {<br />
$0.uppercaseString &lt; $1.uppercaseString<br />
}<br />
Inferred types help to make code clean and less prone to mistakes. Modules in turn help to remove the headers and provide namespaces. Memory manages automatically, and developers do not even need to put the semicolons.</p>
<p><strong>To make the codes more expressive Swift introduces some features:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Generics</li>
<li>Speedy, Accurate and Concise</li>
<li>Structures for Support Methods, Extensions And Protocols</li>
<li>Map and Filter as Functional Programming Patterns</li>
<li>Tuples and Multiple Return Values</li>
<li>Function Pointers Unifies Closure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Playgrounds</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Playground is a new feature that that makes coding fun with the use of Swift. As soon you type a line, and result would appear immediately. If your code runs over time through the loop, you can watch it in the timeline. The timeline would show the variables in a graph draw each step while constituting a view and can play an animated SpriteKit scene. As soon as the developers perfect their code in the playground, they must move the code to the project immediately.</p>
<p><strong>General uses of playgrounds lists:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>1.Watch results at every step of designing a new algorithm.</li>
<li>2.Launching new tests and verifying it before promoting to test suite.</li>
<li>3.Experimenting with new APIs by perfecting Swift coding skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Safe Design</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no chance to have unsafe code with Swift. Variables always initialized before use, arrays and integers, check the overflow and automatically manage the memory. Syntax here turned on to make the language easy and definable. Such as:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>(var) stands for Variable</li>
<li>(let) for constant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>For activating powerful Cocoa and Cocoa Touch APIs, safe patterns in Swift been introduced. It enables proper understanding of the frameworks, addition of a single character helps to replace the entire line of code in Objective-C. This strives to build iOS and Mac app easier and safer than before.</p>

<p>Swift, the name is self-explanatory. It is a fast programming language, with high-performance LLVM compiler and quickly transforms into native-optimized code to get productive results from a Mac, iPhone, and iPad hardware. Revision of syntax and standard code library to write code is going to help the apps to perform the best.</p>
<p>Developers at Apple consider Swift as the successor of C and Objective-C languages. It typically has similar characteristics of Objective-C such as types, flow control, and operators besides objected-oriented features such as classes, protocols, and generics to give a boost to the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch developers.</p>
<h2>A Little More from Our Desk</h2>
<p>Apple has taken a big step by introducing Swift. The developers who joined the event at WWDC in June 2014 accepted the language largely. However, the real test has commenced as developers have started to code their scripts using Swift. Now, we have to wait and watch that how long Swift keeps developers motivated.</p>
<p><em>Would they equally praise Swift as they did Objective-C?</em></p>
<p><em>What new possibilities they could come up with Swift? &#8212;&#8211; Everything is now a matter of time.</em><br />
<strong>If we are asked to judge, then we would like to suggest what Steve used to say,<br />
</strong>“<em><strong>I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next.</strong></em>”<br />

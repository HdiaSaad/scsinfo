<p>Chatting apps have taken online communication to a whole new level.</p>



<p>It’s fast, it’s snappy and it’s fun.</p>



<h4>But should you make another chatting app to compete hundreds of other in the market?</h4>



<p>Taking advantage of these qualities, many entrepreneurs are looking at opportunities to create an app like Snapchat. But why Snapchat? And how to develop an app like Snapchat that gets user favorite?</p>



<p>Launched during a time when giants like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter were ruling the online space, Snapchat made a statement by making their app a unique mix of photo sharing and chatting app. </p>



<p>So if you want to utilize this new model of photo sharing/chatting app for your app, and want to know how to make an app like Snapchat, then you have to know all about this app, its features, and how it makes money, and with this article, we are going to tell you all about it. </p>



<h2>How To Make An App Like Snapchat?</h2>



<p>Now if you want to develop an app similar to Snapchat, I am going to tell you the exact steps you need!</p>

<ol class="scrollspy-links">
<li><a href="#step1"> Take a brief stock of Snapchat’s history and special language</a></li>
<li><a href="#step2"> Consider the main features of Snapchat to integrate</a></li>
<li><a href="#step3"> Figure out the tech stack</a></li>
<li><a href="#step4"> What to avoid when making an app like Snapchat?</a></li>
<li><a href="#step5"> How to make money with a Snapchat-like App?</a></li>
<li><a href="#step6"> The cost estimation</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#8217;s delve deep into the steps.</p>



<h2 id="step1">1. What Is Snapchat Anyways?</h2>



<p>It is an app that offers users a unique blend of photo sharing and chatting app. Users of this app can take photos and videos, add captions and different effects to them, share them with the world as stories, or send them to individual users. However, Snapchat goes against the phenomenon of “everything is permanent on the internet”. By that, we mean that Snapchat photos and videos send to people self destructs after being seen. </p>



<h3>Snapchat &amp; its History</h3>



<p>From the very beginning, Snapchat had something special about it. The owner and CEO, Evan Spiegel knew this. And of course, Mark Zuckerberg, the infamous CEO of Facebook also realized it. Which is why he tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion. </p>



<p>But the founder and owner of Snapchat refused it. And now the app stands at a whopping $33 billion. As of Q1 of 2019, the app stands at 190 million daily users (DAU). According to Snap Inc., <a href="https://zephoria.com/top-10-valuable-snapchat-statistics/" target="_blank">the DAU has increased 2% compared to the 186 million DAU in Q4 2018</a>.</p>



<p>However, Snapchat’s attempts at going against the “it’s-going-to-be-on-internet-forever” concept was thwarted by the screenshot takers. That is when Snapchat integrated the notification system that would inform the user that someone has taken a screenshot of their snap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CbSdK59EFqdP4pAJbXDCrk_4Yr9oILLAWCrGrWu1vt84Y5nwMssF6kk7tz86_5Y1aXnOGvlzx9qDwIRBrUp2qdpZlCPEhPELmp6XBYbnat8r4VKSih8bTs6XSjBVZqxLpxVpSEM" alt="how to build an app like Snapchat  with market stat" />

</figure>



<p>The demographics of Snapchat mainly include teenagers, but it is hitting new demographics with every update. So if you want to learn about making a Snapchat like an app, you have to hit it up with the new generation and learn their terms or invent some, as Snapchat did. </p>



<h3>Snapchat Terms &amp; Predominant Features</h3>



<p>Snapchat hit it big with the youngsters, and that’s not only because of their unique take on chatting but also because of the cool terms they invented to make the app stand out. So take stock of the Snapchat terms and come up with some cool terms for your own app. </p>



<ul>
<li>Snap: video or picture taken by Snapchat users</li>
<li>Story: a snap that doesn&#8217;t self destruct, rather sticks around for 24 hours and all your followers can view them. </li>
<li>Snapchatters: people who are using the app</li>
<li>Snapback: response of the user on snaps.</li>
<li>Score: the number of snaps sent and received over chats. The score is visible next to the first’s name on the contact list. </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="step2">2. Plan An App Better Than Snapchat: The Main Features</h2>



<p>If you wanna plan free apps like Snapchat, then you have to be familiar with the features first. Why? Cause what makes Snapchat different than the rest is actually the features. </p>

</div>

<p>Snapchat emerged in a busy market with features that were unique, and somewhat baffling on the first trial. But once the users got used to it, those features became the most sought after features. </p>



<p>So let’s talk a look at the features of Snapchat features and see why they tick.</p>



<h3>A. Snap &amp; Talk</h3>



<p>The main feature of Snapchat, that made it popular is the unique blend of chatting and photo sharing. The photo-sharing aspect of Snapchat took the central stage on this platform. Added to that, there is a plethora of special effects, lenses, and stickers. </p>



<p>So if you are thinking about using this model of photo sharing/chatting then make sure to add fun effects and stickers to it. </p>



<h3>B. Look Through Snapchat Lenses</h3>



<p>The Snapchat lenses are this unique feature that lets the users add effects on their photos. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2TiRdTelG3as6LQsfaG3nLfB1LfKB5jcb7zbmHRW3o_oIUDHi8Kf5gnk1G-DUOsgsobdXRR0JsX85rvu75OwqJpzozNcNeVQgBc1M8ZEZCiImn1HYEwixDxg1ayxNX8ow0mfxDA" alt="how to create an app like Snapchat with lenses" />
<figcaption>Source: https://9to5mac.com</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Probably the send most famous feature after the snap sharing one, the lenses let the users add quirky effects to their photos. These goofy animation overlays on the photos make the snap experience so much more fun and entertaining. The lenses feature became so popular among the users, that another photo-sharing giant Instagram too adopted the feature.</p>



<h3>C. Geofilters</h3>



<p>These are special filters and overlays available only when the user is visiting certain places. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xECGCVANu074jFpiUZMPkdUqOdNKSE4outoQK8z8-ljk0zASWdHjQQH9-6YHoEhet7ZtVG8uWy4YzFCY7Tzn6rlECB8ZK9HNnpnKmwex4SCgnM4O4LZtn1eWihEX5CztlfbAnt8" alt="Snapchat with geofilters" />
<figcaption>Source: https://allthingssnap.com</figcaption>
</figure>



<h3>D. Add Some Friends</h3>



<p>Adding friends on Snapchat is a bit different than all the other social media platforms. Rather than just searching for friends, users can add friends on this platform in three ways. You can add friends with the nearby option, which will use your location to show you nearby Snapchatters. Then, of course, there is the basic search option. And then there is the Snapcode, which is the QR code you can easily scan and add someone as a friend. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Uy-MciByHJ3AuRuZDz8et08qNFs4MuWGzTmFbklgdEsvd3V5wpZOBq1XnCm9jbymZcG0fi4BSjsj2yt0McT_TqJrFwGVMIWiixl4tKvpPqU_MhCwY1RWjnYyaPteQp0pn8h0TmM" alt="how to develop an app like Snapchat and add friends" />

</figure>



<h3>E. Chatting On Snapchat</h3>



<p>Snapchat is, of course, first and foremost a chatting app. The app has made chatting much more fun by adding the snap sharing feature, and of course, the stickers. They took the somewhat boring concept of chatting app and turned it into an exciting app. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_yXCNn4ZVTxUgQqAvSDf-dlLNQ_c0sXmkL3HWxdsgqTU0IbC9sclWCZIrE6krdT96dTYIHOGzo9-C8ZKZJnkdaRmj_7WWkfNAvdDaiFiQiVDDRmOM3TSVoxgr9Ia0m0HtROs6YY" alt="Snapchat with chatting option" />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-use-feed-snapchat" target="_blank">Imore</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>So if you are thinking about creating an app like Snapchat, re-imagine online chatting. Make sure to add exciting elements on the app so that chatting online becomes more fun. </p>



<h3>F. Video And Audio Calls</h3>



<p>The communicational aspect of Snapchat became more prominent when they added the feature of making video and audio calls. Users can be on call and at the same time send photos. </p>



<h3>G. Stories</h3>



<p>A story is an image or video you can broadcast to all your followers. These stories are available for only 24 hours and after that, they disappear. The feature became so popular that now the story feature is almost on every social media platform. So when you are planning to make free apps like Snapchat, you can’t ignore this feature.</p>

<p>With Discover user can find stories from editorial teams of various big companies like People, CNN, Mashable, Cosmo and many more.</p>

</div>



<h2 id="step3">3. The Tech Stack to Make a Robust App</h2>



<p>The tech stack of your app is going to determine whether it is going to be as awesome as Snapchat or not. So before you think about how to develop an app like Snapchat Android or iOS, check out the tech stack of Snapchat to see what you need to make your app as cool as Snapchat. </p>



<p>You must hire a reputed <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank">mobile app development company</a> with developers adept to the following technologies. We take pride in calling ourselves one, thanks to the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/portfolio/" target="_blank">extensive work portfolio we have on different technologies</a>.</p>



<h3>A. Development Language</h3>



<p>Snapchat leverages the advantages of many developmental languages to make it the best in the market. For front-end development, they use Bootstrap and Java. other languages used for this app are Python, Objective-C for iOS, and PHP.</p>



<h3>B. Cloud Hosting</h3>



<p>For hosting, Snapchat makes use of AWS (Amazon Web Service). And to increase scalability and manage overall data storage, they also make use of Google compute engine. </p>



<h3>C. Database Management</h3>



<p>To handle such a large amount of data in a flexible way, Snapchat uses NoSQL as a database. This way they are not only handling the data in an efficient way, but they also offer great performance. </p>



<h3>D. Analytics</h3>



<p>Analytics are important and Snapchat knows this. Which is why they use Google analytics tool to analyze their website traffic, collect data to improve the overall performance of the app. </p>



<h3>E. Supportive</h3>



<p>To provide users with superior support, Snapchat uses Zendesk customer support tool. </p>



<h2 id="step4">4. What To Avoid When Making An App Like Snapchat? Be Better!</h2>



<p>Sure you are here to learn about how to build an app like Snapchat, but we are also going to tell you what are the things you need to avoid in an app model like Snapchat. </p>



<p>The app may look perfect, but there are many problematic areas. So let’s take a look at those problem areas as well. </p>



<h4><strong>A Better User Interface</strong></h4>



<p>The mass adoption of any app heavily depends on how great the UI design is. The user interface needs to be easy to learn and quick to navigate. Anything less and the app will lose users. </p>



<p>But Snapchat has gone the exact opposite way of this. For the first time user, the UI is quite hard to navigate. The app opens on camera, and one has to swipe around the screen to navigate to other areas of the app. This design may be refreshing, but it is still confusing to a lot of others. </p>

<div class="related-post-box">

</div>
</div>

<p>Which is why when you are designing apps like Snapchat, you have to make sure to create an app that has a better UI design. Even if you have to adopt the most ordinary feature on the UI, it’ll be worth it, especially when more and more people start using your app. </p>



<h4><strong>Relationship With The Influencers</strong></h4>



<p>Every social media platform has influencers on them. These influencers create content on a daily basis and have a big follower base. Platforms like Instagram and Youtube are known for treasuring the influencers on their platform, making sure that they don’t leave the platform. If they leave, millions of their followers will also leave the platform, creating a serious dent on the user base of the platform. </p>



<p><a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/dicey-situation-snapchat-gives-influencers-cold-shoulder/" target="_blank">But Snapchat is not playing the influencer game well</a>. In fact, back in 2017, a famous Snapchatter Michael Platco was reminded by Snapchat to follow the platform rules and had his account deactivated for a short while. This gave rise of unrest among the influencers, who are now migrating to other platforms. </p>



<p>So if you are planning on building free apps like Snapchat, then make sure that you are aware of the presence of influencers on your platform and support them. These influencers have a passionate fanbase who are ready to leave the platform along with the influencer. So, foster a good relationship with the influencer and your app will see a continuous rise. </p>



<h4><strong>Provide Right Advertisement Metrics</strong></h4>



<p>When it comes to putting advertisements on social media platforms, the advertisers need the right metrics to see whether their advertisements are working or not. So just assessing how to build an app like Snapchat is not enough- you need to plan the right strategy to earn from it.</p>



<p>Snapchat however, does not provide much support when it comes to the advertisement metrics. The metrics they will provide the users with are very basic ones, and it does not give much hope to a marketer. All they can track is total views, number of screenshots taken and story completion. </p>



<p>Whereas on Instagram, you can find better advertisement metrics. Even with their Ad tool, you can’t track much except for reach eCPM and impressions. So when you are making apps like Snapchat, you have to have better advertisement metrics. </p>



<p>So when you make apps like Instagram and Snapchat, make sure to give the marketers the chance to track click-through rates, conversions, website traffic, etc. the more marketers use your app to market your product, the better the profit you will make. </p>



<h4><strong>Ability To Reuse Content On Your App (unlike Snapchat)</strong></h4>



<p>Once again, from a marketer’s point of view, it is much easier to create content for Facebook and Instagram than Snapchat. Along with that, you can even reuse these content and use them on other social media platforms. But when it comes to Snapchat, the format is so unique, that you will have to create separate content for the app.</p>



<p>However, that wouldn’t be a problem if those content could be used in other platforms as well. But you can’t. Snapchat content is unique and very expensive to make, which is why many marketers question their worth. </p>



<p>So make sure that content sharing on your app is easy and marketers don’t end up questioning the worth of running a marketing campaign on your app. </p>



<h4><strong>Don’t Limit The App Experience (like Snapchat)</strong></h4>



<p>When you are using Snapchat, you know what kind of content you are going to see. It’ll be someone’s birthday party or wedding,   random snap, some Saturday night party photos, vacation photos and that&#8217;s about it. When it comes to the app experience, Snapchat provides a limited number of experiences for the users, compared to other social media platforms. </p>



<p>Make sure that even though you are making an app similar to Snapchat, you don’t limit the user experience. Users love different kinds of experience on one app, increasing their level of engagement with it. So have more that one way to engage with your app. </p>



<h2 id="step5">5. How Can You Make Money With An App Like Snapchat?</h2>



<p>How does Snapchat make money? And how you can also make.</p>



<p>It’s an important question for you if you want to know how to build an app like Snapchat. Because you need to know all about the monetization strategy of Snapchat to know how you are going to make money with your app. </p>



<h3>A. Paid Ads</h3>



<p>Snapchat utilizes paid advertisement in plenty of ways to generate revenue through its platform. </p>



<p>Firstly you have the discover section, where big enterprises and publications have a chance to publish their content for over 190 million users worldwide. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/top-app-monetization-ideas/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" width="981" height="227" class="wp-image-9889" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/app-monetization-ideas-1.png" alt="how to make money from your app" /></a></figure>



<p>There are also snap ads. These ads are integrated between Snapchat stories. When the user is swapping between the stories of their friends, these snap ads will show up for a few seconds. They also show up on the discover page.</p>



<h3>B. Lenses And Filters</h3>



<p>Sponsored lenses and Geofilters are two other ways Snapchat is bringing in the money. </p>



<p>The main difference between sponsored lenses and Geofilters are that Lenses are moving animation overlays for photos, while geofilters are fixed frames for photos. </p>



<p>The sponsored lense feature is used by many brands to market their product. For example, we can talk about the time when Warner Bros. became the first advertiser to use the sponsored lens feature, to market the movie “Everything, Everything.”</p>



<p>Geofilters, on the other hand, are fixed filters that are only available in specific places. Mcdonalds became the first user of this feature with their branded geofilters available for all of their restaurants in the Morocco</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vjZPpnsRAOJizjPlbSnm56Rs7P1nK_P0kGqLfsz5mScHivsL5gE4elpPwq0bVCFYickq6B_B7nFhlTtNFhBhA-6-FUMPFrXWCNJLzWUqm36_PVvvIxK8iYff2LLV0M6etSRjrD4" alt="how to make an app like snapchat  with creative features" />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/snapchat-mcdonalds-geofilter/" target="_blank">Dailydot</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Brands can easily pay to have special lenses and filters designed for them. This is a unique form of marketing and Snapchat is obviously making loads of revenue just with that. </p>



<h2 id="step6">6. The Cost </h2>



<p>And now we come to the matter of cost. </p>



<p>Obviously, you have to think about how much it is going to cost to build an app similar to Snapchat. While it is pretty hard to pinpoint the exact cost until you have actively spoken to an app development agency, we can attempt to help you with an estimate. The cost of making an app like Snapchat depends on four things- the team you hire, the kind of MVP you develop, the platform for which you develop your app, and the kind of contract model you have entered with your app development agency. </p>



<p>But remember that spending a lot is not going to guarantee a successful app. It all depends on how well the features are integrated into your app and how well it has been developed by the team of developers. </p>



<h2>5 Apps Like Snapchat Which are Going Big</h2>



<p>After reading through this article you might be thinking, “is Snapchat the only app like itself in the market?”</p>



<p>Well, of course, it has competition. Just like any other big player, Snapchat too is facing lots of competitors in the market who are giving it a run for the money. And when you develop an app similar to Snapchat, these apps are going to become your rivals as well.</p>



<p>So it’ll be better if you learn all about the five following apps who are similar to Snapchat and are giving it a good fight for the market. </p>



<h3>A. Instagram</h3>



<p>Instagram needs no introduction. </p>



<p>Launched in 2010, this giant among photosharing apps was acquired by Facebook. We all know Instagram as a photo and video sharing app, but it has a pretty good messaging feature as well. The service also added the Story feature, just like that of Snapchat. On top of that, users can now choose from numerous Instagram face filters when they are uploading photos on their stories. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ejyX49NbXjKu7Q_2extOeeyvPxVuGzEBHu_EwvAXP4gb1bwk5neB-IHeNYF1a_9lq_tqBUQKKY9wMyxKcrX48qa6CuigRepvGZ1NZLqzyXAm2qDAA-CzT6Hh99e4WOpzydvsfoo" alt="how to build an app like snapchat and instagram" />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252" target="_blank">Apple</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Even though Instagram is not exactly like Snapchat, which is more focused on communication through visual elements (i.e photos and videos), it comes to a lot closer to it. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg, the owner of Instagram now seems to be altering the platform to match Snapchat in the market </p>



<h3>B. Kik Messenger</h3>



<p>Kik messenger, launched in 2010, became a fast favorite among the teenagers because of its instant messaging feature. Users can easily add their family and friends on this app. The app is anonymous, meaning that you can sign up without having to register a phone number. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oBNuPqMI5x4lRRMT5P7eRw3T_gXIH4-WiHDufUXfiEoypfOaZGMLFCqQEnA_gdjHlAqYX0FYtZnVGqRjBvWOHre2w-2JQT_jauigcjoz6wVfShmhp27b3XdKTyoGnwQICdQVAG8" alt="how to develop an app like snapchat  and Kik messenger " />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/" target="_blank">Google</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Kik has a great messaging feature, that includes clicking and sending photos, with the added feature of filters on it. This is why it is one of the biggest competitors of Snapchat. </p>



<h3>C. Youcam Perfect</h3>



<p>Now we all know Snpachat has an amazing camera feature. And many users use it just because of that. But there is another app that is giving the ghostly app a big competition on the camera front and that is Youcam perfect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vOEnQvwMPol7xDD_4HUHt8sV5lHD-wWEdbdl4QjE3aL3NOJreonxH1O-9fWQTlOENV3sQH6zWEtDMeu_SPX5Jkg-3-P5Z6_TTT9SVMckarRsAUbFwKFgsz_V0qHx9J2um5oedZw" alt="how to create an app like snapchat  or You cam perfect" />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youcam-perfect-photo-editor/id768469908" target="_blank">Apple</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>When it comes to the photo editing aspect of the app, Snapchat is definitely getting a big competition from this app. The app will offer you two options to beautify your images, one being the auto beautification mode, the other being the manual edit mode. For those who only use Snapchat for its camera, Youcam Perfect is definitely a perfect alternative. </p>



<h3>D. Clipchat</h3>



<p>Clipchat is one of the apps like Instagram and Snapchat. Critiques have brushed this app aside by calling it a clone of Snapchat. And some might even think so because it has similar features to Snapchat. However, Clipchat comes with a better interface.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CzlGNMQ1kACl0yaikrS4i3dgkGF37GuRW3XLfKs7ekEQ9bzN7F9oSlDJugpLsHIEuVAmtijjPIoA_122_YUUVPuwGmyGOSwfXOBKk7-bjyPITlbancDHplSWbVBcnFtKJO3aO2g" alt="how to build an app like snapchat  and Clipchat" />

</figure>



<p>Finding and adding friends is pretty simple for users. Which is why for those who like pretty interface, Clipchat is a better alternative for Snapchat.</p>



<h3>E. Wicker Me</h3>



<p>Wickr Me offers the users with an encrypted messaging feature, where they can send text, images, and videos. Just like Snapchat, the app has a shredder function. With this, the app gets rid of all the erased images and videos. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rcunqC0Mj-6DC7RHjDlZ_3JMdRR1QSEQv62SKlpXU2EBwbc5gurQk6eNd24pCLdC7HqnEL4JxwOBqHuaQYUfxPRsRA43_gTYjywbygSNaGrx8an1TOOgra0p2-J9zxdrfAG-mnI" alt="how to build an app like snapchat  or Wicker Me" />
<figcaption>Source: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/" target="_blank">Google</a></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>User’s Wickr ID stays anonymous which means that no one can track them. Wickr Me also has image filters, stickers, and graffiti that can be applied to the images taken by users. </p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Your Take?</h2>



<p>Making an app is not easy, especially when you are trying to make an app like the super successful Snapchat. </p>



<p>So if you are thinking about making a similar app, then you should start with using the app and taking stock of all its pros and cons. The app may seem all perfect, but it also has some of its downsides. And you need to avoid those downsides in your own app. </p>



<p>Snapchat is definitely a big app, but that doesn’t mean your app also has to be this big from the very beginning. Remember that Snapchat began as a small messaging app, and slowly developed into the giant it is today.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" width="981" height="227" class="wp-image-9891" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/app-development-tricks.png" alt="how to make an app" /></a></figure>



<p>It all depends on how much time and care you are taking to develop your app. Take your inspiration from the evolution of Snapchat, and surely your app can generate success like that as well. If you still have questions on making your own Snapchat like an app, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/about/contact/" target="_blank">contact us</a> with your idea and we&#8217;ll help you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In the corporate world, there is a growing trend of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). Employees are advised to bring their own devices to access company’s applications and data. In order to overcome this impediment, many companies are now taking the help of a multi-platform mobile app or what we call in technicals terms, a cross-platform mobile app development to upgrade their current devices and enable it to be used across a wide range of mobile platforms and in different kinds of operating systems.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Cross-Platform Mobile App – A Deeper Understanding</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we talk about cross-platform mobile app development there can be two situations. One can either develop the app on a native platform or develop the app in a singular environment first and then allow it to be used in various native platforms. Cross Development tools use the simplest programming languages like JavaScript, CSS and HTML that makes it easier for the developers to write the core application easily and proves to be a helpful tool for companies offering <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile application development services</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Tools Used For Cross-Platform Mobile App Development</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the tools that are used to make a cross mobile app is code free. Developers do not have to undergo through the tiring process of writing complicated codes. There are a number of tools which makes developing a cross-platform mobile app an easier task. So, let’s take a brief look at all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. PhoneGap</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a free tool which first-time app developers can make use of. PhoneGap can easily translate code from CSS, JavaScript and HTML. They maintain software development kits (SDKs) for every platform on which an app is developed. Apart from developing an app for an iOS or an Android, it lets you to develop apps for Windows and Blackberry as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>What’s special in PhoneGap?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I. The API interface allows the developer to write codes in any language and then converts the code to a native one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">II. It boosts the JavaScript API with an access to important components of a device like GPS and camera.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">III. The UI and the application logic is based on HTML and JavaScript, whereas the other part of the application is based on a native language.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Appcelerator Titanium</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Titanium takes the help of SDK tools in order to create native iOS and android apps by helping you to make use of almost 90% of the code from other apps. Being an open source tool, updates itself constantly as hundreds of other developers regularly contribute to make it more functional.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>What’s special in Appcelerator Titanium?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I. Being a web oriented tool, it helps not only to develop the app but is also cost effective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">II. The prototype-based scripting is similar to that of JavaScript.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">III. No need to learn separate languages for iOS and Android, because the tool helps you to implement the code easily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Cocos2d</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is mainly used in 2D game development. It gives developers five different platforms to develop their programming language.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>What’s special in Cocos2d?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I. It is written in Objective – C which is a superset C language.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">II. It makes use of open GL swap buffer in order to deal with the memory handling problem easily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">III. Better screen management with animated screen transitions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Corona</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A specially developed cross-platform tool for 2D gaming graphics, Corona speeds up your games up to 10 times. Based on a programming language Lua (an Objective C language), this tool is robust and helps a developer to finish coding in less than five minutes. So, the next time you see your games running fast, you know what is responsible for its superior performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>What’s special in Corona?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I. Automatic integration of OpenGL-ES.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">II. The tool is optimized in a way that it boosts the power of hardware thus accelerating the performance of apps and games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">III. Works easily with X-code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Xamarin</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to choosing the best cross-platform mobile app development tool, then Xamarin is the most preferred one by most of the big organizations around the world like IBM, Microsoft and Dow Jones. The tool makes use of various languages like C# or Ruby in order to create a stronger platform for developing mobile apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>What’s special in Xamarin?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I. Shortens the development cycle of an app, by offering the benefits of a native UI.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">II. Integrates the UI and APIs of Mac, Android and iOS apps in their respective languages, as a result of which they can support a system even when new features are added.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">III. The simplified syntax of C# helps to prevent errors that result in a bad programming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. Alpha Anywhere</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though it’s a bit expensive tool to afford, but the cost is worth its usage. Alpha Anywhere can work with a variety of languages such as Xbasic, Cobra, C++,.NET, JavaScript and C#.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>What’s special in Alpha Anywhere?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I. Built in <a href="https://unified-infotech.blogspot.com/2015/07/responsive-web-design-services-two.html" target="_blank">responsive</a> web design tools for enhanced user experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">II. The option of creating downloadable <a href="https://unifiedinfotech.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/native-html5-or-hybrid-exploring-the-mobile-app-development-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hybrid</a> PhoneGap applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">III. Added benefits of HTML and SQL.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Future of Cross Platform Mobile App Development – Bleak or Shining</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom" target="_blank">Gartner Mobile Apps Report</a>, it is expected that by 2017, people will download mobile apps 268 billion times more than the current pace, resulting in a revenue generation of $77 billion. In the coming times, technology will take a giant leap and the demand for running a mobile app in various operating systems will increase. With a cross-platform mobile application, that day is not too far when the technological world will witness the evolution of mobile apps that are made for running on a variety of operating systems.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Signing off!</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an increase in demand of multi-platform mobile apps, the world is slowly moving towards an era of more technologically advanced digital age. The arrival of a cross-platform mobile app will slowly emerge to be the most convenient feature in the mobile app industry for the future generation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Fiksu, 10.3 million mobile apps were downloaded in January this year. These figures are an indication how much demand mobile apps have around the world and is also a sign of positive growth for an <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>app development company</strong></a> that specializes in developing mobile apps for android, iOS or any other mobile operating system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We use mobile apps in solving almost everything. From what started as a gaming software, mobile apps have now entered in our everyday lives and is playing the role of Google in our everyday lives. Just as Google has an ‘How to’ or a ‘What is ’ answer to every problem we put in the search engine, in the same way a mobile app helps us to find a solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is hardwork, creativity as well as complex coding which is involved in developing a mobile app. In this blog, we will discuss about the problems faced by a developer while designing a mobile app and how they can be overcome.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. <strong>Wrong Mobile Platforms</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the people are not able to decide what is the platform that he or she is targeting at. He or she should always be aware about the type of platform to be used whether it is <a href="https://unified-infotech.blogspot.com/2015/09/boost-business-roi-with-iphone-app.html" target="_blank">iOS</a>, Windows or <a href="https://unifiedinfotech.wordpress.com/2015/09/10/use-cloud-and-apis-for-android-app-development/" target="_blank">Android</a>. Problem rises at that point of time when one has to invest at a multiple platforms, thus it raises the amount of cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to solve?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Decide the platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Find out your target audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. Take all the technical aspects into account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d. Know the basic strengths of the platforms where you want to operate your app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">e. What is the current market of the app and what is their market share.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you get an answer to all these questions, you will be confident enough about your app and sell them with confidence.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong>Bad User Interface</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Believe it or not, the popularity of a mobile app depends upon it’s user interface. Users uninstall or remove most of the mobile apps from their mobiles if it does not have a good user interface. As a user, everybody looks for a user-friendly app that can be used across different platforms. They always look for apps which are less complex and are easy to operate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to solve?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Hire a UI designer, who can design your mobile app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Make sure that the navigation system is easy, because that’s what plays a major role in an improved User Interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. Use different kinds of analytics tools for mobile like Flurry, Kissmetrics, Localytics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d. Use Heatmap, Heatdata and Appsee for better visual analytics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">e. Let your mobile app go through the A/B testing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. <strong>No Marketing Strategy</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marketing is also an integral part in mobile app development. You might have developed one of the best <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/mobile-app-development-3-hot-tips-to-build-millennial-friendly-apps/" target="_blank">mobile apps</a>, but if people are not aware about it, then there is no use of it. You should have a blue print about the type of marketing tools and strategies to be used for your app and have a step-by-step guide of your marketing plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to solve?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Share everything about your app in social media. This can be done either by writing a blog or by making an Infographic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Write press releases to spread the news to people and to all those who like technology and its products.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. <strong>Launching the App in One Language</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you launch an app that goes viral and is downloaded by users all across the world, then this might not prove to be fruitful until and unless your app is launched in multiple languages. Having an app in multiple languages will also increase the possibility of potential users who can download your app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to solve?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Know the demographics of your users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Find the language spoken in those regions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. Launch the app in those regional languages.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. <strong>Lack of Funds</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might have an idea for an app that has never been launched before, but even before developing it, it is necessary to know the cost involved in developing the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to solve?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Look for investors who are interested to invest in good technological ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Look for companies that have are looking for joint venture partners. Doing this, will help you to distribute the cost with the partnered company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. Try some crowdfunding platforms like AppBackr and Kickstarter.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">6. <strong>Wrong Mobile Content</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Managing content is not only an important thing in a website but it also plays a key role in a mobile. Videos, images and animations or any other elements added to a mobile app is very crucial. Sometimes, due to bad wireless connectivity, the performance of a mobile app fails. Hence, it is vital to manage the content in a proper way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to solve?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Improve the app’s bandwith usage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Manage the content just in accordance to the requirement of your target audience.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">7. <strong>Less Interactive</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Users do not want an app with basic features. The more interactive the app will be, the more popular will be your mobile app. A mobile comes equipped with sensors that are high-tech, hence it is important to make use of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to solve?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Keep buttons that take the user to different places in the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Include more options in addition to tap and swipe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. Add more interactive options such as flip, shake and tilt.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">8. <strong>Complex Design</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your users have to use an app, which make them think twice, then that is definitely not the kind of app that your users are looking for. It is the responsibility of the developer to design the app in an user-friendly way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to solve?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Include tutorials, instructions and guidelines and let your users know about your app in detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Icons and thumbnails help a user to go through the app easily. So, use them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. Refer to the user interface guidelines by Windows, Apple and Android. Reading the guidelines will give you an idea about the different kinds of user interface that one can develop in a mobile app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, whether we want to book a cab or want to purchase apparel from an online shopping store, a mobile app is the fastest and most convenient way to do it. It has brought technology so close to us that all we need to do is tap a button and get that service. Hence, developing it in a simple and clear way will satisfy the need of the users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hustle bustle on the Whatsapp, playing the Subway Surfers or sending a recent Snap by the Brooklyn Bridge with your new girlfriend on the SnapChat. Millennial mobile are power packed with features and apps, which are real time productive and let them connect the world on the go. This was the fun part, but they also love to do their banking, to submit their education loan, keep a track of their expenses all via full-featured online apps. They are the netizens and not just citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So while designing apps for the millennial you need to remember some essential thing. You need to keep few things in mind while developing the apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever platform you might choose to promote your app &#8211; iOS or Android you have to remember that your apps must garner gazillion eyeballs and downloads. Therefore, are you thinking to mint a brand new app, and then make it millennial-friendly without any second thoughts?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Who are These Millennials?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Millennial are people born in between the early 1980s to the late 1990s, they are the Generation Y, they come just after Gen-X.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why Target Milennials?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make your appear among the top ten you have to acquire 4000 downloads. It is easier to gain downloads if you target the milennials. They are the generation using Smartphones in good numbers. According to a recent survey by Nielsen 85% of the millennials, aged 18-24, owns a Smartphone and 86.2% aged 25-34 own them. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/" target="_blank">Mobile app developers</a> need to target this particular segment of the audience to skyrocket app downloads. You just need to place yourself in their shoes and see what apps you would have preferred using as a millennial. Your app will acquire certain introspection before development.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4159" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/725876787-compressor-1.jpg" alt="725876787-compressor" width="1168" height="1411" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/725876787-compressor-1.jpg 1168w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/725876787-compressor-1-248x300.jpg 248w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/725876787-compressor-1-768x928.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/725876787-compressor-1-848x1024.jpg 848w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are the three bright tips to make your apps millennial-friendly –</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Convenience is the Master Key</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apps means convenience, take for example Uber cabs app. you just tap and within no time you get a cab and you are on your way. On above of all, you can pay for the cab directly from the app. if you are a football fanatic then you cannot wait to check out the live scores of a match, so most of the users have Live Score Addicts&nbsp;on the mobile. Find something good to read, you pushed it to Pocket app to give it a read in the spare time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Millennial love to stay connected on the subway, movie theaters, in the classroom or even in the washroom of a mall. Therefore, you see app increases the user experience by tenfold. So make sure that your app excels to provide a service better than a desktop, TV, voicemails, direct mails or any other conventional medium.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Thinking About the Mundane</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Get a clear idea of the routine needs of users then build a unique feature around it. Make sure to turn it into the focus of the app. Domino’s for instance was going through a rough phase. Their cheesy products were not able to find no takers. There was an immediate overhaul of their marketing strategy. So they targeted the hungry late night millennial in no time, they build an app around this one particular feature to cater food to the hungry late night milennials. The callers love to order a pizza with a few clicks, and this idea worked and from that day, Domino’s sales never sulked. So is your app mundane?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Avoid Build Something Similar</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The app does not get high download if they find similar kind of feature compared to the other, which has something better. Common services provided by an app are not something great downloadable. It would make it to the burial ground in no time. For example, if your app only helps the user locate stores, then they will not download, since they have Google Apps or Apple maps to do it for them and using such maps are easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starbucks made this mistake by making an app to locate their stores exclusively, but it had disaster downloads. So abandon building something common, rather build something unique to target your millennial customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile health apps developers who make sure that their design blends a better user experience will yield the most success. So what the mobile health app developers of today must consider to ensure success? The solution to the app success is nothing other than usability engineering. Moreover, mobile apps today are showing increased sizes while synchronizing with small, wearable device such as Apple Watch that also use apps and have their set of usability challenges.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/" target="_blank">mobile app development services,</a> our developers have found that, usability engineering is something that they can call their cup of tea. Let us get ahead and know what makes us claim it as the most successful framework.</p>
<h3>What Do Mean By User Experience (UX)?</h3>
<p>According to the reports published in usability.gov, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/" target="_blank">User Experience</a> <em>“focuses on having a deep understanding of users, what they need, what they value, their abilities and their limitations. It also takes into account the business goals and objectives of the group managing the project. UX best practices improve the quality of the users’ interaction with the perceptions of your product and other related services.”</em></p>
<h3>Why is UX Important for Health IT Industry?</h3>
<p>Transition from paper medical records to EHRs has transformed how health information has a notable record, analysis and shared within the provider and payer community as well. For the most part, health consumers may not consider during design, development and testing these enterprise-wide systems. Transition of EHRs to mobile platforms will have a different experience as a health consumer’s access and share their health data on Smartphones and Tablets. Health consumers of today is an eminent part of base that you must consider as mobile health apps are some of the popular health apps on commercial marketplace.</p>
<p>The way users interact with mobile devices and apps have a profound way with how often we access data, which is one of the eminent factors to consider for the Health IT Community. For example, with the use of Smartphone users, “Pull to Refresh” to update the screen with the most updated information. However, these human factors changes when you interact with a Smart Watch or other wearable technologies. A vertical swipe scrolls the user to add extra information on the current screen while the horizontal swipe displays the previous or the upcoming screen.</p>

<p>As for content available, Health IT Data and Information which is usually dense and complex. The graphical presentation in such an instance is often the best approach to display. However, when does a graph on a Smartphone become usable to a physician, nurse, technician or even the health consumer?</p>
<p>There are several presentations at HIMSS15 Conference, which addresses a number of questions. From the perspective of technology, software engineers, designers, and usability experts to understand how the users want to interact with the device and information is critical and determines the overall user experience, acceptance and success of the app.</p>
<p>At Unified Infotech, software developers and designers are cognizant of their importance of the users interface and visualizing the content. When you need to “pull” and when to “swipe” are important decisions that we consider. Our creative team closely works with the software developers to create custom designed mobile applications. Moreover, the most preferred technology that we use is none other than “Usability Engineering.”</p>
<p>We have just started to take big leaps with our developers to make things big. We have cashed the new opportunities and helped those interested in transforming their Health IT services with human factors, usability, and design for both mobile and wearable devices. Consult or <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank">hire android app developer</a> from SCS INFO to change your health services with the human factors and enriched user interface.</p>

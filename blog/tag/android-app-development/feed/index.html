The compact tablet-smartphone hybrid is now an intriguing piece of phenomena in the tech world. However, the uniqueness of foldable smartphone app development is leaving a lot of app developers and designers baffled.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13229" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13229 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash-1024x684.jpg" alt="folding smartphone display" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13229" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Photo by Mika Baumeister on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">New entrepreneurs and app development companies all over the globe are now wondering how to design and develop apps for these new smartphones. Surely, as the phones change, so will the well-established rules of development. But the question is- how much is it going to change?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, if you are one of those who are wondering about </span>such apps<span style="font-weight: 400;">, then you are at the right place. Our in-house experts have conducted in-depth research on the design/development process for new smartphones, and we are going to discuss it here. Are you ready? Let&#8217;s begin.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. New Era Smartphones: What Are They Bringing To The Fold?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Foldable smartphones are taking over the market rapidly. The popularity has reached such a monumental peak that according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/983531/global-foldable-phone-shipments/">forecast</a>, by 2022 global foldable shipment numbers would reach a staggering 50.1 million units.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13231 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-938x1024.jpg" alt="foldable smartphone app development" width="938" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-938x1024.jpg 938w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-275x300.jpg 275w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-768x839.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1407x1536.jpg 1407w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1876x2048.jpg 1876w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/foldable-smartphone-market">another source</a>, the foldable smartphone industry is also supposed to grow at a CAGR rate of over 21.3% throughout the forecast period of 2021-2026. All these stats are pointing towards the only fact- the fold is the future of the smartphone industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The new style of devices provides not just space and comfort of use, but it also offers more screen real estate, more versatile use of apps, and true streamlining of the workflow. The expectations for these devices are high, but they also challenge the basic app development process uniquely.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s take a look at these challenges, shall we?</p>

<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Challenges Of The Foldable Smartphone App Development</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Folded or unfolded, the new-age smartphones come with lots of features and functionalities. However, these expanded use cases are challenging many <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/">app development company</a> in new ways. Here’s a comprehensive list of all the issues our in-house experts deem more important to pay attention to-</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. App Continuity</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Continuity issues are one of the major app development challenges for foldable phones. It is all about an app switching from one state to another based on the orientation of the screen. For example, an individual using the phone in a folded state might suddenly want to unfold the phone for better usability. And when they do that, the app they were using should switch to fit the expanded screen without missing a beat.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/5jSZQR3eK6RFWbFJbP" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/5jSZQR3eK6RFWbFJbP">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only the app needs to fit the newly folded/unfolded screen, but the </span>app features<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and content also need to scale accordingly. So far, it is one of the major challenges app designers and developers are facing with </span>foldable smartphone app development<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Ratio Awkwardness</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because Apple has not yet brought forward any foldable iPhone news, most of the phones in this segment are Android. And when it comes to building an app for Android phones the aspect ratio challenges are many. There are numerous devices, each with varying screen sizes. And with foldable, the difficulties for any <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/">Android app development company</a> have increased tenfold.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13232 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-669x1024.jpg" alt="foldable smartphone app development" width="669" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-669x1024.jpg 669w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-768x1175.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1004x1536.jpg 1004w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1338x2048.jpg 1338w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-scaled.jpg 1673w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The foldable phones support multiple screen ratios, both in the folded and unfolded state. Based on the type of fold and multi-tasking functionality, the mobile app UX designs need to fit multiple ratios and work perfectly without breaking the rhythm. Additionally, the size and shape of foldable smartphones are <a href="http://www.nathancunn.com/2018-11-09-foldable-phones/">causing some awkwardness in screen/ app ratios</a> especially when it comes to consuming media through smartphones. <span style="font-weight: 400;">And this increases the number of challenges faced by </span>foldable smartphone app development<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. Multi-Window Functionality</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the multi-window functionality, the users can run several apps side by side. However, facilitating this can be tricky. Earlier, while using two or more apps on the same screen, the active app will run while the others would be paused. But now </span>foldable smartphone app design <span style="font-weight: 400;">enables users to run multiple apps on the same screen simultaneously.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The information sharing, along with the aspect ratio scaling, poses some serious challenges for any web app development company out there. To make an app work well, they have to make sure that it works well simultaneously with the other apps on the same screen perfectly.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. UI Changes Feature Accessibility Limitations</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Besides folding screens, smartphones today also sport multiple screens. The folded version of phones such as Galaxy Z Fold 2 comes with a narrow screen on the top, and when unfolded displays a bigger screen that almost resembles a tablet.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13233" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13233" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13233 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/merlin_166842705_bc10c164-c7f3-49dd-aafe-f83095958047-jumbo.png" alt="folding smartphone apps" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/merlin_166842705_bc10c164-c7f3-49dd-aafe-f83095958047-jumbo.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/merlin_166842705_bc10c164-c7f3-49dd-aafe-f83095958047-jumbo-300x200.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/merlin_166842705_bc10c164-c7f3-49dd-aafe-f83095958047-jumbo-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13233" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.nytimes.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the dual displays on such devices improve efficiency, it creates certain issues for the accessibility of features and functionalities of the application. What kind of features would be accessible through the small screen? What kind of mobile app UX design will be better suited for the bigger screen? All these and more feature/functionality-related questions haunt the app developers and designers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">e. The Spine</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spine, a.k.a where the smartphone folds are posing another design issue. Whether it is an inward folding phone or outward folding screens, the spine can cause the </span>app features<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to wrap and get displaced. All in all, the spine of the device can create foldable smartphone app development challenges that are never before seen for app builders.</span></p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. Unified Infotech’s Solutions For Foldable Smartphone App Design</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Considering all the design and development challenges, any custom app development company you partner up with has to be a master of the craft. Today app development is not only about following the best practices, but also innovating continuously. How is it done though? Let us give you a peek inside our process of designing for the foldable smartphone-</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Examining The Use Cases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">For foldable, we begin the app development process with the expected use case scenarios.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Different apps have different purposes and can be used either in a folded state or in an unfolded state (in the case of multi-display smartphones). So we need to begin our design process by analyzing exactly how the users would utilize your app.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use case examination enables us to better conceptualize the </span>foldable smartphone app design <span style="font-weight: 400;">and wireframe. Additionally, it also enables us to optimize the development process accordingly.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Extensive Wireframing</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">As an experienced mobile app development company, we give the wireframe process ample attention to make the process successful. And when it comes to designing for foldable, we double down on our efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">App wireframing is a process of mapping out how the content and design elements would look on-screen and how the users would navigate. Our extensive mobile app UX design also includes the transitioned screens of the app. From the look and feel of folded/unfolded screens to the navigation elements- we map it all out.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. Making Use Of Screen Real Estate</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the many plus points of </span>foldable smartphone app development<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the increased screen size.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13234 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1024x1001.jpg" alt="foldable smartphone app development" width="1024" height="1001" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1024x1001.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-300x293.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-768x751.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1536x1502.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-2048x2003.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the increased screen sizes, we can now incorporate more </span>foldable smartphone app design <span style="font-weight: 400;">elements and content on the app screens without making them crowded. We make full use of the increased space, creating </span>UX mockups and UI elements <span style="font-weight: 400;">that will use the increased space well without making the users overwhelmed with a crowded screen.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. Reducing UI/UX Roadblocks</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite the bigger screen, there are plenty of UI/UX roadblocks that we must deal with to make the foldable android app usable. And the most important of those is the one/two-handed use of the device.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The extended screen size makes it impossible for people to use the smartphone one-handed. So, sometimes they must switch to two-handed mode. And during mobile app design &amp; development, we ensure that the navigation and the design elements are distributed accordingly for an enhanced experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The initial use case examination stage helps us to understand when the user would be switching to full-size screens and when they would be using the app in the folded state. With this insight, we focus on placing the crucial feature element at the core areas of the screen. During the app development process for foldable phones, we work to enhance the usability of secondary screens as well. Our careful wireframing process ensures that the screen doesn’t look too overcrowded and the users can make the most of the app even on the smaller screen.</p>

<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. Unified’s Foldable Smartphone App Development Solutions</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Foldable apps might be simple android apps, but they do come with certain technical challenges that seem daunting. But as an experienced app development company, we are well aware of how to deal with such challenges. So let’s see how they view these following roadblocks to developing an android app and solve them daily.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Using Simple Transition</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/">Agile development process</a>, we treat the issue of app continuity just like app transition from portrait to landscape mode. Only in this case, the transition happens from the folded state to unfolded state.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The expectations are clear- while using the app, the user would change the orientation of the phone from folded to unfolded or the other way around, and the app would switch accordingly while retaining the same data as before. To accomplish this, our application development process uses methods like Saving the UI state and making use of the ViewModel.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Multi-Window Support</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Facilitating multi-window support is hectic enough. And on top of that users now expect all the apps open on the same screen to be in a resumed state. To facilitate this mode during foldable android app development, our developers first make sure that the app is resizable by defining resizeableActivity=true in the manifest. This tells the system that the app is resizable and will play nice in the unfolded multi-window mode.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13235 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-814x1024.jpg" alt="foldable smartphone app development" width="814" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-814x1024.jpg 814w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-238x300.jpg 238w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-768x967.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1220x1536.jpg 1220w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1627x2048.jpg 1627w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-scaled.jpg 2034w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This compatibility is integrated throughout all the components of the app, including but not limited to all activities, services, etc. Additionally, through drag and drop permission, our developers enable the users to share information between different apps with ease.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. Consider The Aspect Ratio</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The new foldable phones pose one of the biggest aspect ratio issues in app development. The matter of aspect ratio for foldable smartphones is related to the screen sizes, screen orientations, state of the smartphone as well as multi-window support. To support the app in any aspect ratio, our developers make use of ConstraintLayout. It enables them to create bigger and more complex layouts with variable ratios that fit into the expectation of users.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. Extensive Testing And Quality Checks</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The new smartphones are still not entirely reliable. These devices are still in that trial and error phase, with new changes appearing almost every release. So it goes without saying that the app development process for these devices will also be subjected to rigorous testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the device testing, which ensures that the app is supported by a plethora of devices both foldable and unfoldable, we put the app through basic tests. As a </span>foldable smartphone app development company, <span style="font-weight: 400;">our aim is to build apps that work smoothly without any hassle. And our testing process enables us to accomplish this flawlessly.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">To Get To The Market Top, Take Advantage Of The Fold Today!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite all the UI/UX challenges and build-related questions, foldable smartphones are gaining momentum. So don’t wait, be the early bird, and optimize your app for foldable support today.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Google I/O is a developer-centric conference. We have seen that most of the innovative announcements made at the event. The news directly affects or improve the experience of Google’s customers. This year was also no exception. Google I/O has kicked off with some interesting product announcements and updates. Many of the new techs revealed at the event affect us in our day to day life. It will turn the future of the upcoming iOS &amp; <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank">Android app development</a>. It means worth checking out what’s new from the company. In 2017, the company has heavily worked on visual recognition and features. And we clearly see the development in this department in the tech mentioned below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might call that boring. But it is also a misguided notion. There was much to collect from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai" target="_blank">Google CEO SundarPichai</a> and the rest of the Googlers who presented onstage. So here are the 8 most important take-out from today’s I/O keynote.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">#1 Android Surpasses 2 Billion Monthly Active Devices</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android’s mobile supremacy hasn’t stopped growing. SundarPichai exposed at the keynote’s start that the score of monthly active Android devices now surpasses 2 billion. That includes smartphones, Android Wear devices, tablets, Android TVs, and any other gadgets that are built on the operating system.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">#2 Google Assistant Can Understand the World Around You</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google Assistant would now be able to examine your general surroundings with the assistance of your smartphone camera. Utilizing an innovation, the organization calls Google Lens, the Assistant will investigate your surroundings and show applicable content on your screen. You&#8217;ll see a restaurant’s rating while pointing your phone at the storefront, you can point it at a flower and it will recognize the species, and you can even pull up a band&#8217;s music or recordings by pointing Lens at a show poster. In any case, the most helpful example may be this: if you point Lens at Wi-Fi login credentials, your Android telephone will have the capacity to utilize that data to sign on to that network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google’s not the first company to try to improve artificial intelligence to a smartphone’s camera. Samsung freshly launched “Bixby Vision” on the Galaxy S8, a sight-based version of its own Bixby digital assistant.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">#3 Google Assistant Comes to iPhone</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google Assistant is expanding beyond Android to iOS. Assistant will be an impartial app on iPhone and iPad. It will offer many of the same functions. As the same, we have seen it on Google’s own operating system. You don’t have to wait long for it. It’s available starting today.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">#4 Google Home Turns into A Phone</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like Amazon, Google is transforming its smart speaker into a phone. Over the coming months, every single Home proprietor will have the capacity to put free calls to the Morocco and Canada. As a matter of course, Google utilizes a private number for this feature — yet you have the choice of binds it to your own particular cell phone number. The same goes for every other person in your home, as telephone calls support Home&#8217;s multi-client setup. Just outgoing calls will be accessible at launch, as Google is adopting a wary strategy to avoid privacy headaches.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">#5 Google Photos Adds Books and Easy Sharing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google Photos is getting a large number of awesome additions. The application will now suggest that you share photographs you&#8217;ve brought with individuals that it perceives as being in the shot. Google calls this Suggested Sharing. It&#8217;s likewise presenting Shared Libraries, which enable families to aggregately add pictures to a central collection all the more effortlessly. Yet, Google is accentuating control, here: you can share your whole photograph library, share just from a specific date, or share photos that incorporate certain things like your children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital backups are awesome, yet imagine a scenario where you need physical memories. Google now offers printed photograph books. Books can be made straightforwardly on yours recommend the phone. Google will even prescribe books to you when it supposes a particular collection makes sense. Books are accessible starting today at costs that begin at just $9.99.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">#6 Standalone Virtual Reality Headsets Are Coming</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google’s VR ambitions are growing beyond Daydream’s current form. It involves your smartphone to your face. The company announced that upcoming headsets from partners including Lenovo and HTC or won’t need a PC and smartphone to power the user’s VR experience. You just need to put it on and it works. The headsets track virtual space with something Google calls “WorldSense,” powered by technology from its Tango augmented reality system. Unfortunately, we didn’t hear exactly when this standalone vision will become reality. Google just offers a vague “coming soon.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">#7 The First Android O Beta Is Available Today</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google is propelling its review program for Android O, and the primary beta is being released today. We&#8217;re still in the entire beginning of Android O&#8217;s advancement, so you shouldn&#8217;t introduce this preview on your ordinary cell phone. Be that as it may, in case you&#8217;re biting the dust to look at the big new features — enhanced notifications, picture-in-picture, and that&#8217;s only the tip of the iceberg — you can select a perfect Pixel or Nexus gadget and start trying out Android O.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">#8 Google’s New Ai Chip Could Turn the Cloud Into Its Next Android</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pichai rushed to pound home the point that his organization&#8217;s future relies on artificial intelligence, particularly the machine learning methods that let algorithms learn all alone and enhance after some time. This innovation supports everything from its Assistant and searches to Google Photos and the AlphaGo framework. Amid the introductory statements of the I/O keynote today, Pichai reported Google&#8217;s cutting-edge Tensor Processing Unit, a uniquely composed chip for machine discovering that works with the organization&#8217;s TensorFlowplatform.for machine discovering that works with the organization&#8217;s TensorFlowplatform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">After the release of Android Studio in 2013, developers found a strong support. A support for developing an app. This IDE (Integrated Development Environment) from Google provides the perfect platform for native <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank">android app development</a>. Equipped with the most prolific features along with advanced characteristics it has offered a boost to the development environment. Cloud computing support with cloud messaging integration gives strength to an android app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Android Studio 2.2 – An IDE Worth Using</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest version of Android Studio comes loaded with three main themes mainly – Smart functionality, speedy execution, and bigger Android platform support. It was first unveiled at the Google I/O this year. Its popularity is due to the advanced features, which gives easy solutions to a complicated application problem. The process of android app development has become quicker and faster with Studio 2.2. New layout editor, APK analyzer, expanded code analysis, enhanced layout inspector are some of the amazing features.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the developer’s point of view, this version comes as a great development tool. It can handle multiple platforms of Nougat 7.0 such as code completion, notifications, quick settings API and multi-window support. Moreover, the built-in emulator is one additional feature that facilitates the process of testing the app. The creation of Android Frameworks along with the constrained layout structure is another added feature in this version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now developers can easily design complicated layouts in a hierarchy fashion. Constraint layout, on the other hand, easily integrates the app in the form of a support library. You can create the library with the latest layout editor. Another good news is that it has more than 20 plus features in each stage of android app development starting from designing to development and testing eases the process. Designing the user interface to making newer constraints and Jack compilers, these are some of the greatest additions to the second version of Android Studio. It is the official emulator of Google to carry out the functions of android app development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Used by millions of developers around the world, there is no doubt that it will facilitate the process of making an app. We are presenting here some of the features of Android Studio which will help you to get a clear idea about the latest feature of the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Can Studio 2.2 Enhance Android App Development?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, the answer will be clear once you get to know about the latest features. So, let us take a look at them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Designing Gets A Facelift</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the new interface designer, you can create a more prominent structure of your app. This is possible with the layout editor. The blueprint mode of the editor enables you to prepare a rough structure. This allows you to understand the attributes of the widget in a clear manner. The constraint layout is a kind of layout manager that enables a developer to make more dynamic user interfaces. While compiled with a layout editor, it really works well. To get an idea of how constraint layout works, take a look below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LeHT8Z3cD5E/V-ATFjJvz5I/AAAAAAAADZo/7IIzBCfZjPQLg1uf3KaeFc67qYft5YK0ACLcB/s640/image00.gif" alt="Android Developers" width="640" height="550" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Image source: https://android-developers.blogspot.in/</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rapid Android App Development</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An upgraded C++ from the Gradle point of view is in operation. It is now possible to migrate projects from CMake to Android Studio seamlessly. In the latest Android version, many bugfixes. Built the sample app with a shared object library and native library with an APK. You can find it in the project wizard of the studio itself. Sample codes are much easier to work with now. In the code editor window, you can now find occurrences in the app and start the process of development fast. Apart from this, with C++, a developer can also make new native files from the directory itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Build Stronger Apps</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To fasten the process of android app development, iteration cycles are the new thing. In Android Studio 2.2, stability and reliability are the two main components. If you have already used a feature of ‘Instant Run’ previously, you should be familiar with the issues. In the latest version, you won’t come across this. Moreover, there is an APK analyzer, which contributes to each of the components. Currently, many new strategies are there to create a cache with incremental build times. There is a facility to enable android.enableBuildCache=true with the grade properties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rigorous Testing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android Emulators are now equipped with virtual sensors. The latest UI controls allow developers to take advantage of Android Sensors like Magnetometer, Ambient Temperature, and Accelerometer. Thus it facilitates the process of testing. Espresso Test Recorder is another addition. It allows you to do UI tests while recording the entire testing process. The tester can even test the application locally using the integration server. With GPU debugger capturing a number of OpenGL ES commands now becomes possible. There’s an option to debug the graphical output for improving the performance of ES command.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With world-class coding experience, debugging facility, flexible built-in system, and instant deployment system, Android Studio 2.2 helps a developer to make high-quality android apps. This IDE from Google eases the process of development. It improves the user experience at the end. Instead of using the traditional present perspectives, Android Studio gives just the right tool to the developers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s the layout editor, APK analyzer, sample browser, and many strong features, which make Android Studio 2.2 more special. Moreover, the Run Window also consists of log messages that one can see while running the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, Android Studio 2.2 will definitely enhance the android app development process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are planning to have some off the shelf android app experience with improved functionalities and zero bugs, then we are ready to give you a robust app. Just send all the requirements of your app by sending an email to <a href="mailto:contacts@unifiedinfotech.net">contacts@unifiedinfotech.net</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile app manufacturers around the world are focusing more on enhancing the customer experience when it comes to offering them a complete app solution. This characteristic is unique irrespective of any mobile operating system for which an app is developed. To keep up in pace with the global demand, even the process of <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/">android app development</a> is constantly under constant modification so that it is able to keep up with any latest updates coming in the devices and can subsequently carry it in the upgraded versions of Android.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, the concept of Android Fragmentation has taken off as newer devices with improved capabilities are coming to the market. In fact, you will be stunned to know that this is due to the fragmentation that even an operating system like Froyo is still in use despite Android N already being available in the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What Was The Need For Fragmentation In Android?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first question that strikes is ‘Why is fragmentation required at all in android app development?’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, the need for fragmentation in Android primarily arose due to the disparity in devices as far as some features are concerned. Being fragmented, one can easily port the features of a particular device to an upgraded version. From a manufacturer’s point of view, the purpose is to make the versions lighter. This is the reason why an android device running on MIUI looks entirely different from a device running on a Nexus device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make it clearer, let us take an example…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a special feature ‘iris scanner’ in Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which is not present in any other android devices. Now, whenever an updated version of Android comes, this particular feature can be ported to that device with the latest version. Being an open source operating system, it becomes easier for the developers to do that. So, why not opt for it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Fragments – Fastening Your Apps</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fragments act as catalyst in speeding up the android app development process. No device rooting is required when you have fragments along with you. It’s interesting to note that how it fastens the process of developing an application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s take a look</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Home Screen Optimization</strong>: If you are suffering from a slow-running software of your home screen then it is time to optimize the screen. Using fragments can fasten your home screen as you can witness a small amount of increase in the home screen. It allows you to reduce the total number of widgets used, thus subsequently reducing the amount of load.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Remove Unnecessary Applications</strong>: There are some apps, which you might not use anymore or rarely use. It takes up the maximum space in the CPU and thus hampers the processing speed. One can identify the apps by going to the task manage with the help of high resource usage. However, it is recommended that you should analyze the app and watch to what extent it causes a problem. If you find the problem is disturbing, then you can uninstall the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Install Customized ROMs</strong>: Latest versions of Android perform faster than the existing ones. This is done in order to reduce the time lag. The benefit of fragmentation is that even if your phone is not updated with the latest version of Android, you can often upgrade it with the help of a custom RAM.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Overclock the Device</strong>: Do you know that just as you can over clock your computer, in the same way, you can also over clock your device? You can at anytime over clock your device if you want it to perform faster. Remember that there is no role of fragmentation here. All you have to do is just properly over clock the device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Is It A Good Or A Bad Thing For Android App Development?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While most of the people have this impression that using a fragment could hamper the process of android app development, but this is a wrong notion as there are ample benefits of fragmentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Transferring Information Between Apps</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since each screen was developed as a separate activity with the android app, it became difficult to transfer the information in between the activities. The object, which has been used, should be globally accessible with a reference. Hence, each screen is treated here as a separate fragment. As a result, the hassle of transferring data is completely passed on to other websites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Making A User Based Interface</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two most commonly used user interface – Tabs and Dropdown menu lists. Each one of them has got their own functionality. While the usability of tabs come when there are few screens. On the other hand, dropdown works well when there are several of them present. The presence of Fragments makes the user interface metaphors easy. As a developer, one has to simply ActionBar in the right mode of navigation. Fragment Transaction helps a user to switch easily between all the displayed fragments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Sophisticated UI Metaphors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the usage of more sophisticated UI metaphors, the need for rich user based design is increasing. Swipe-based navigation is one of the examples where one can easily move between two screens while staying in an application. By adding fragments on each screen, one can place the view page in the user interface layout and connect that to the FragmentPagerAdapter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, with these powerful features, Fragments is definitely a blessing for developing an android app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap Up!</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In spite of being complicated, Fragments bring with them an array of benefits as far as android app development is concerned. As a leading android app development company, we have complete expertise in working with android fragments. If you are looking for a digital engagement company, which can make the dream of making your android app into reality, then you can count on us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As per a report, on the first quarter of 2016, 17.2 billion apps were downloaded. Out of those, 11.1 billion were Android apps. Though most of these downloads mostly comprised of games, but the figures prove the growing popularity of such android apps all over the world today. Developers are looking for more advanced tools to create even more inspiring and engaging apps, which would be of use not only to the masses but to the businessmen as well and benefit the human kind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as <a title="Android App Development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank">android app development</a> is concerned, it’s the kind of infrastructure that a developer makes use of which boosts the power of a mobile application. In technical terms, the tools which a developer use is commonly referred as SDK or Software Development Kit. It is the secret for creating phenomenal as well as high-performance apps for Smartphones, tablets, Android wear or Android TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android Studio 2.0 , the official IDE from the giant has everything which a developer cannot even expect from any other SDK. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/6-key-factors-to-consider-while-developing-android-app/" target="_blank">Everything which you need to develop an android app</a> is available in this latest version starting from code analysis tool to emulators and code editors. In this blog, we are going to enlighten you about the various benefits and how it adds more power to a developer’s software development kit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>New Features With More Power</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A bunch of new and powerful features of Android studio 2.0 makes it the ultimate choice for the developers. Let us study which are those.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Instant Run For Instant Results</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole purpose of this latest tool is to increase the developmental work of an application. The ‘Instant Run’ is a new feature that lets the developers accelerate the speed of running, building and editing the cycles. It injects the changes made in the code by implementing it in the app running process. Thus, you do not need to reinstall or redeploy your APK. It can work with any kind of android device that runs on API 14.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Android Emulator For Faster Deployment</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like a nitrox in a vehicle, the emulator speeds up the performance of the CPU, thereby making it work 3 times faster. In fact, when you include ADB, the speed increases to a whopping 10 times faster. Apart from the speed factor, the new emulator also has sensor controls and brand user interface. A host of new capabilities has been added this time to the emulator such as the facility to drag and drop the emulator for faster installation, make use of many touch points and rescaling the window.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cloud Test Lab For Robust Testing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android Studio 2.0 makes the process of testing, one the application is developed. It makes your app run through a series of tests along in Google’s own products. It makes sure that your app does not crash. Moreover, the interface of the Android Studio 2.0 is also such, that it can configure all the tests that have been done on Cloud Test Lab. Google views it as an extension to all the testing processes so that it becomes much easier to perform the tests in all kinds of devices including Smartphones and Tablets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>App Indexing For URL Generation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People looking for your android app in the store will find it more easily. With proper app indexing, Android Studio 2.0 enables you to rectify the URL structure in the app code and lets you add any kind of attributes in the AndroidManifest.XML file. Once you finish adding the URLs to the app, you can validate the app indexing code and start the testing process. One interesting thing about the app is that you can check the validity of the app with the help of the index code, which you have used in the Android Studio.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Debugger Preview For Clear Graphics</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While developing applications for graphical apps, you will now get a GPU debugger with this latest version of Android Studio. It enables you to do a frame-by-frame check. This allows you to find any bugs related to graphics and gives you more information on GL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Future Updates And What To Expect?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On June 2016, Android Studio 2.1.2 was released. Though there haven’t been any notable changes in the update, but only three key updates were made which are given below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Modified LLDB performance and new crash notifications.<br />
2. Security updates.<br />

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&#8220;iOS is stale compared to Android! It needs fresh ideas!&#8221; (Says <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/03/is-ios-outdated/" target="_blank">Wired</a>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Last year we heard such comments repeatedly in popular tech or app blogs. That&#8217;s surely a much-debated topic, but open-minded will recommend Apple and Google to swap a few ideas to enrich their OS, as none of the brands can get an upper-hand over one another, both are best in their own way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What features will they likely exchange among each other? What features can inspire their OS? This blog is going to share some good features of Android that iOS users will live to use. In different spirited conversations, experts have found a few selective picks that might gel perfectly with the iOS users.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Users won&#8217;t like iOS turning to Android or vice-versa. So, our view stresses more on freshening iOS with features to help people who are more Smartphone savvy. Apply has a keen eye on the elegant implementation and <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank">Android can surely be the source of inspiration</a> &#8211;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>1. Auto-Correct Options and Spelling Suggestions</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Spelling suggestions by iOS are frustrating. The battles are still on in their latest version (iOS 7). Where does the problem lie?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">You might have been typing a long way, suddenly iOS auto-correct option pops up to tell that the text you wrote is not right. iOS gives a suggestion and if you do not tap on the word it suggests, it will correct on its own. That&#8217;s annoying and irritating. You have to replace the word as iOS does not have any user-editable dictionary. Either you have to type the words as text macros or simply wait for the app to track the right spelling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Compared to iOS, Android gets an upper hand when we type an unknown word, the Android OS suggest a solution above the keyboard. Even if it manages to modify the word that the user does not require, just with a single backspace one can restore the original word. It will make a query whether to add that word to the dictionary to boot. Apple should adopt this feature, to make the text more <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/" target="_blank">user-friendly in iOS</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>2. Contextual Services like Google Now</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Google Now is indeed a vast service which does voice actions like Siri. We won&#8217;t ask Apple to take this away, rather we will ask them to adopt Google Now&#8217;s ability to provide notification and other related services based on contextual information such as location, schedule, whether users are mobile or not, etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Google Now provides routing and traffic notification for places user intends to go, scan user&#8217;s appointments in the calendar. When the user approaches a mass to transmit it displays transportation schedules and informs the user when they come to their point of interest. It can scan your past search history and find out your favorite sports, events, music fests and will offer relevant information on them. Google Now is of ample help to professionals, as it forwards emails and notifications up-to-the-minute. Google Now gives the user the ability to opt-in or out easily unlike Apple, which keeps on filtering emails and reads the GPS location, making it uncomfortable for users.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>3. Quick Access to Notification Center</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There are devices that you might not prefer to use daily. It may be the Wi-Fi or display settings, hotspot or do not disturb button. Android users have the facility to access setting via Notification Center, helping users with a quick and easy way to toggle without jumping all the way out of the app. If you are able to pull the shade while remaining inside a third-party app, the user can still adjust the setting without leaving the app. As for iOS users, such features will be able to decrease the number of taps required otherwise, simplifying usability and enhancing the iOS experience. Even though iOS 7 has a revamped Notification Center, but Android gets a checkmate when you see something in their Notification Drawer and can take action as well as respond without opening whatever app first.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Hitting the Bottom-line!!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Android user enjoys a variety of apps that features more user-friendly outlook compared to iOS. However, both of the OS have their own set of benefits and they can swap it to entail more tailor-made solutions for their users.</span></p>

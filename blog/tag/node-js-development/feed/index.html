										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s an interesting story behind the birth of Node.js. Ryan Dahl, the inventor understood that execution engine has a better usage. Thus, the concept of server side JavaScript came into use. It gave birth to Node.js. The tech savvy global population is on a rise. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-nodejs-developer/" target="_blank">Node.js development</a> is the thing, which companies rely on, these days. The global IT market rests on this wonderful technology. Whether it’s the acquisition of StrongLoop by IBM or FeedHenry by Red Hat, there are plenty of them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What Drives Enterprises For Node.js?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every company expects greatest return on its revenue. Companies like Paypal and Walmart rely on Node.js for better performance. It is a great solution for enterprise-based applications. Unlike traditional development methods, it makes apps, which are small modules. They remain connected together. It serves as a strong weapon for making single page web apps. Hence, instead of developing one big application, developers can only change the functionality. Not only this, a developer can also change the entire database. Every application has its own dependencies. They prevent any potential conflicts, which might arise in the development process. For perfect node.js development, expect high performance transactions at less cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simplified maintenance and modification are the two primary areas. Node.js offers its primary benefits here. One can write applications even with small modules, which comes together. One can make changes in the core functionality and change the code later. To get scalable web application, there is a need to develop an application. It takes place in the most intimate manner. One of the enterprises, which benefits from using it is Uber. Most of the development work took place with Node 0.8. Technologists believe that one benefits to almost 15 billion dollars with Node.js. But, geospatial database and replication is not written in Node.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maintaining framework with Node.js development is easy as many opportunities arise. Companies with web facing infrastructures need innovation, especially at the backend. Often, they have to deal with the dual challenge of developing software and building an IT team. To address the demand for developing apps, one has to use RESTful APIs in the most flexible manner. The focus rests on large data volume for large-scale software systems. It is one of the most efficient ways to take advantage of large-scale softwares. A developer can reduce app development time with Node.js.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">How Will Node.js Influence App Development Process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ever-changing commercial landscapes have given birth to many node communities. They can use some of them in a simplified manner. Now let us see how it will change the development process in the time to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rise Of Modular Design</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Often companies use the parallel development process. On one hand, a team uses Node.js while the other uses Java. Working with two softwares, results in doubling up the website traffic. With the help of java application development framework, one can make large applications. Service oriented architectures act as the solution for giving instant remedy. This includes complex web service apps. Each module has separate functionality. One can share that with various teams of developers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Greater Ecosystem</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The great ecosystem of Node.js makes the perfect place to develop an application. It combines all the low-level system programmers along with front-end JavaScript development. There are various dependencies in the ecosystem. They help to make the process of developing an app easier. There are more than 3,00,000 packages which adds ecosystem in the best possible manner. It is three times greater than any kind of ecosystems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Increased Collaboration</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A deep alliance forms with Object Oriented Programming. It makes the functional components easier to work with. When a developer shares the code in Java, it forms part of the libraries. It is possible to make the applications smaller. They have fixed functionality with more focused components. Use universal JavaScript, there is an opportunity to create front end development. It is more efficient in handling all the efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Support From Node Community</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a huge community support, which you will get from the Node.js community. Those who are using Node.js for the first time will get plenty of help from here. There are many benefits. One can apply application code, improved sight productivity and do live instrumentation. If you want to develop large-scale business applications, install the right strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Market It Well</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Operational teams and developers must come together for better project execution. You only need few lines of code and a good modular design to contribute towards the accelerated time. The dynamic nature of Node.js applications allow you to use small modules and use it. One can develop and deploy the web services at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Adjust The Operating Costs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Node.js development has an important role to play in reducing the costs. Companies, which use Node.js, leave a smaller impression and have less power. For instance: if you have a server of 64GB RAM, then a developer can run up to 32 instances of Node.js. Modern cloud environments and operating teams have one thing in common. They have a one to one relationship with each other. You can use them to cut down the cost structure of your organization.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Websites That Use Node.js </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take a look at some of the websites which makes Node.js development a part of their process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wsj.com</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paytm.com</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Freecharge.in</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flickr.com</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outbrain.com</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alexa.com</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Wrap Up!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Node.js development is a technology we need to thank. Its ability to develop web applications with plenty of viable options is its USP. This helps companies to bring the new age development into use. Our developers have diverse knowledge of complete Node.js development. Our execution strategies are better than anybody.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.Js</strong> is the hottest trend in the tech realm, giving developers a choice of 35,000 modules to browse. Users say Node is too easy to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/" target="_blank">develop a working application</a>, which can balance without trouble. The fan base of Node.Js has started to spread their rhetoric like religion. Let us check out what makes it distinctive.</p>
<p><strong>What is Node.js?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> says, “Node.js is a packaged compilation of Google’s V8 JavaScript engine, the libuv platform abstraction layer, and a core library, which is itself primarily written in JavaScript. Used in server side coding, handling AJAX requests, maintaining routes for different APIs and manipulating database.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How Node.js works?</strong><br />
Ryan Dahl, creator of Node.js was aiming to create real-time websites with push capability, inspired by applications like Gmail. So there he comes with Node.js. In the Node.js, he gave developers a tool for working in the non-blocking, event-driven I/O paradigm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know, in web browsers developers are restricted to use language as they have to provide security to the user. Usually in such cases, all activities aim at DOM-manipulation and asynchronous page info loading.</p>
<p><strong>Here, Node.js opens up opportunity for new perspectives retaining its browser nature. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">1.What in Node.js developers find easy and compatible with their jobs?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">2.What the experts have learned over the year?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">3.What mistakes newbie must avoid?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, with time experts have become aware of various tips and tricks that can benefit both – a newbie and expert. Let us share some of those benefits to help you recap or start fresh.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.js: It is Asynchronous</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A distinguishing feature of Node.js is that it is single-threaded, designed and implemented as asynchronous from top to bottom. More than 60% of the developers have faced problems due to this asynchronous property, but today most of them person knows the solution. When you a run a time-consuming job such as accessing the database, use a counter to keep track of the loop, or else before completing the loop the next function would commence.<br />
Bad luck exists, as it is still possible to make synchronous/blocking calls. Well, many file systems have both asynchronous and synchronous versions, such as writeFile and writeFileSync. Even if you avoid the asynchronous method in your code, it is possible to exist in an external library that has blocking call.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Look here – </strong><br />
<strong>GOOD PRACTICE: Write Files Asynchronously</strong><br />
1| fs.writeFile(&#8216;message.txt&#8217;, &#8216;Hello Node&#8217;, function (err) {<br />
2| console.log(&#8220;It&#8217;s saved and the server remains responsive!&#8221;);<br />
3| });</p>
<p><strong>BAD PRACTICE: Write Files Synchronously</strong><br />
1| fs.writeFileSync(&#8216;message.txt&#8221;Hello Node&#8217;);<br />
2| console.log(&#8220;It&#8217;s saved but you just blocked ALL requests!&#8221;);</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.Js: What’s Callback Hell, How to Handle It</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>What is Callback Hell? &#8211; Excessively nested asynchronous callbacks referred as Callback Hell.</em><br />
It is good to keep nested callbacks to a minimum limit, as it is a simple way to untie your callbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Let us begin with a typical example to explain our point &#8211;</strong><br />
1|function register(name, password, cb){<br />
2| checkIfNameExists(name, function(err, result){<br />
3| if(err){<br />
4| return cb(“error”);<br />
5| }<br />
6| checkIfPasswordGood(password, function(err, result){<br />
7| if(err){<br />
8| return cb(“error”);<br />
9| }<br />
10| createAccount(name,password, function(err,result){<br />
11| if(err){<br />
12| return cb(“error”);<br />
13| }<br />
14| createBlog(name, function(err, result){<br />
15| sendEmail(name, function(err, result){<br />
16| callback(result);<br />
17| });<br />
18| });<br />
19| });<br />
20| });<br />
21| });<br />
22| }<br />
<strong>You would come across certain asynchronous operations that lead to Callback Hell, its &#8211;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chain of Asynchronous Operations:</strong> Get something from API, process it with another API and write the result into database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Asynchronous Set Operations:</strong> Collection of objects, performs asynchronous operation or some other actions when all operations are complete</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>And to prevent callback hell you can browse the great libraries such as:</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Async.js</strong>: Allow easy execution of functions in series without nesting them<br />
<strong>2. Bluebird</strong>: Promises makes asynchronous logic more manageable with mapping and enqueueing<br />
<strong>3. Q</strong>: Reveals the concept of promise just like bluebird to manage the nested calls effortlessly</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.Js: Separate Util and Config File</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Developers must make it a habit of using util.js file for frequently used functions. Try to acquire this file as a variable in your module. This in turn would reduce the number of global variables and code length. Even can config files that stores constant parameters.<br />
Suppose you require an application to show details of top five students, it can vary and become ten students. So do not be hard with your code limits. Keep it in the config file. One best practice is to maintain a ‘Lang’ folder that is useful for a multilingual application.</p>
<p><strong>As for file acquiring aspect, it is simple in Node.js. You can write,</strong><br />
1| var util = require(‘./util.js’),<br />
2|<br />
3| englishMessages = require(‘./lang/en.js’);</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.js: Looking at the Monitor Performance</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ask yourself how you could monitor the application performance and profile, as you need to make sure that the app in running at optimum speed. Well, for that you would get some tools like- Nodefly, New relic, etc<br />
<strong>Nodefly</strong>–A simple line of code that starts to monitor your application to detect memory leaks, or measure how long it takes for redis, to make mongo queries and other stuffs.<br />
<strong>New Relic</strong>–This tool would help developers to monitor response time to server monitoring in your real-time and data-intensive Node.js application.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.Js: Delegate using Granular Modules</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You have to work with many tables in Node.js, so it is necessary to split codes. It is better to make different modules for different tables, and to interact with child modules make a separate parent module.<br />
Well, let us demonstrate an example &#8211; There are different departments in an office database, 4 to 6 project make a department and number of employees makes a department.</p>
<p><strong>Now you can structure this project with four modules – </strong><br />
a. Employees<br />
b. Projects<br />
c. Department and<br />
d. Office</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here <strong>Office</strong> is your parent module and rest three is the child. Function of this module is to pass controller to the proper module. Suppose you tried to update the <strong>Employee</strong> table, for that, you have to update the <strong>Projects</strong> and <strong>Department</strong> as well. Do not try to acquire other modules into student module. It is better to pass on the request to Office module, and it would direct the request to preferred module, this would help you to sort code and review errors easily.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.Js: Debugging is Easy</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you hail from a language with heavy IDE integration like Java or C#, then debugging Node.js seems to be confusing. Most new Node developers prefer to adopt debugging pattern with the use of console.log. However, you would still get some alternatives, conventional to debugging. Node.js comes with a built-in debugger that runs by calling node debug, like <strong>Node Inspector</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node Inspector</strong>&#8211; A debugger interface for node.js using the Blink Developer Tools (earlier WebKit Web Inspector). It allows developer to debug the application using any editor and chrome web tools of their choice. With <strong>Node-Inspector</strong>, developers can do some cool stuff such as live code changing, step debugging, scope injection and other cool aspects. To follow up the aspects find out more at <a href="https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.Js: Be Careful with the New Modules</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You would come across more than 35,000 modules in Node.js, but some of them are dead. With Node.js changing their API repeatedly in their major versions, it is confusing to work. The module works under <strong>v0.8.x</strong> may abort under <strong>v0.10.x</strong>. Therefore, before you sprang on a new module, you should check the PR List to make sure that it is free of bugs or is it under maintenance.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.Js: Node Package Manager is a Marvel</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Node Package Manager is the root of all deployment systems for Node.js, underlying the PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) providers eases out management of library dependencies. Node comes with amazing npm that installs modules specified min your package.json manifest file. Well, in such an instance newbie’s keeps the package.json updated with all modules they use. It painful to open the package and update dependencies property with new modules every time, but npm does this for you!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, it is better to run the npm install, save a module name, and in turn, npm would automatically update the package.json with correct module and version name.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.js: Be Careful About Errors</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For newbie’s, it is important to remember that node can crash easily for a single error. Therefore, it is our suggestion to the newbie and the experts to handle errors properly and throw a proper message against it. Use of try-catch box slows your process, so avoid it.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.js: Do Not Forget to Return</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the beginners forget to return after a callback. While sometimes this has no implication at all, but there are times when you run into odd issues because you might get a callback twice.</p>
<p><strong>Let us see an example for it – </strong><br />
1| function do(err,result, callback){<br />
2| if(err){<br />
3| callback(“error”);<br />
4| }<br />
5| callback(“good”);<br />
6| }</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The snippet does make a sense. If you find an “error”, send in the callback, if not send good. However, calling for the callback is not a good way to stop from completing the execution, it would move on to calling callback.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.js: Conclusion</strong><br />
Often today, we get down creating real-time applications with the use of Node.js. You must be looking for their future use in certain projects such as APIs or networking projects, for them Node.js is going to prove as a great model of deployment. With their, pre-formatted asynchronous code and use of language that is easy to pick, Node.js is a sheer popular choice.</p>

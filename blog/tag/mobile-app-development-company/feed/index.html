										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you get when you take the Uber app model and dog walking, and smash them together?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple, <strong>a dog walking app</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dog walking app model has been in vogue for the dog owners for quite some time. It is not easy to have a pet dog. No matter how much you love your furry little baby, you still have social responsibilities, and a job to take care of (I mean, the job is kind of a must, considering the lavish lifestyle you want your dog to have!).</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/KhMslxMPXdQbu" width="480" height="390" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dog-walk-KhMslxMPXdQbu">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These responsibilities can easily interfere with the various responsibilities you have towards your dog. You can’t just adopt a dog, you need to train him, groom him, take him to the vet, and regular walks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you can’t outsource help with all these responsibilities through different dog walking platforms. But you can when it comes to dog walking. With on-demand dog walking app development we mentioned, it is super easy to get dog walkers on short notice for pooch’s regular exercise. Especially for those millennials who are busy to take their dog for a walk. Interested to create your own dog walking app like Uber? Read on to know more.</span></p>
<h2>How to Develop an On-demand Dog Walking App?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a step by step description of how to create an on-demand dog walking app like Rover and Wag!</span></p>

<h2 id="How_does_a_dog_walking_app_work"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Dog Walking App: How Does it Work? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An amazing use of the Uber for X application model, the dog walking app is making it easy for busy dog parents to get walkers easily whenever they want. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11074" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11074" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11074 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net.png" alt="on demand dog walking app by AI robot" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net.png 800w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net-300x225.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11074" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://dribbble.com/shots/5687141-Drone-dude-walking-with-dog</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to any on-demand delivery app, with these dog walking platforms, the users register themselves, with adequate details about them and their dog. They can add detailed notes about their dogs, which might include information on vets and medications, leash, collars, and harness, etc. After registering, the user can book a walk or ask for a dog walker and they will be matched with a walker near them who can take care of the dog when the pet parents can’t. Uber for dog walking solution has made this easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now dog walking app platforms are extremely popular, among both the dog owners and dog walkers. Because it happens to be a great source of earning money, as well as hanging out with dogs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry though, making such a dog walking app is actually very easy. All you have to do is to follow the below steps or contact a professional dog walking app development service.</span></p>
<h2 id="Market_analysis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Will it be Profitable to Develop Another Dog Walking App?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, we all know how much dogs are loved and cherished by their owners, but what does that have to do with the rising popularity of the dog walking apps? Is developing a prosperous pet care platform really profitable?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, in order to understand the rising popularity of the on demand dog walking app, we have to look at two different kinds of statistics. The first one is, of course, the number of households in the US that own dogs and the second are the average numbers of hours a person has to work every week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to APPA’s national pet owners survey 2019-2020, around</span><a href="https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 63.4 million households in the USA owns a dog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And according to this </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/323441/average-hours-worked-per-week-by-full-time-us-workers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statistic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least 40% of workers have to work 40+ hours every week. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11056" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11056" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11056 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/work-hours-in-a-week.png" alt="work hours in a week.png" width="725" height="592" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/work-hours-in-a-week.png 725w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/work-hours-in-a-week-300x245.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11056" class="wp-caption-text">Source Statista</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we consider these two stats, you’ll see that most of the dog owners have to work more than 8 hours every day. And on top of those 8 hours, they also have tons of social and personal things to do. And even though they do love their dogs, these things are still important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to these apps, people, especially those who have too much to do every day, can rest assured that their pets will be taken care of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few reasons why dog-walking apps are becoming so famous.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time-saving &amp; Efficient</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Way Of Earning</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase In Business For Dog Sitters And Daycares</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Figuring_out_the_basic_features"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Basic Features That You Need for an MVP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, you have to sort out and implement the basic and necessary feature for your app. This would answer how to develop an on-demand dog walking app in the first place.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11057" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development.jpg" alt="on demand dog walking app development like Uber" width="638" height="641" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development.jpg 621w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can already tell, a dog walking app is a very feature-driven app. These features need to be designed to make it easy for the owners to use the app. And that’s why we have listed below some basic features that your dog walking app needs.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Sign Up/set Up A Profile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any Uber-like app, your app should have the feature of signing up and setting up a personal account. This is a must-have feature because it will be easier for the owners to manage the walks and sitters they book, schedule the bookings and cancel in case they don’t need a sitter anymore. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Inserting Information About The Dog</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature would enable the users to add special notes on their dogs to their app profile. These notes can be on anything, from their behavior quirks to any medicines they might need, or any allergies they might have. These notes are going to further help the designated walker to take care of the pup while on a walk. </span></p>
<h3>c. Booking A Walk</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you need this feature for your app to be called a dog walking uber app. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users should be able to book a walk easily and efficiently. Keep in mind the time factor for implementing an easy walk booking feature on your app. It is an important and the main feature to build your on-demand dog walking app solution.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. GPS Tracking</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this feature, the users would be able to track their dog on their walk and would also be able to check the route the walker has taken. This is another convenient feature for those anxious dog parents who are not exactly assured about having a stranger walk their dog.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Walk Log</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the walk log feature, the dog walkers can keep a log of events that happened on the walk. These records can include pee-poop logs, any other dogs they met on the walk, duration of walking, water breaks, whether the dog played any games or not. With this, the user would have an easier time keeping a track, which might come in handy. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">f. In-app Payments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the in-app payment feature, the users can easily pay off the walkers through the app. It means that the users don’t have to hand over cash or go through complicated back transfers. They can just pay using their debit or credit card through the app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">g. Ratings And Reviews</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can leave reviews and ratings based on their experience. These ratings would help the dog walkers to get even more assigned walks. Additionally, the users can express additional tips concerns about a certain walker if they have a bad experience. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">h. Scheduled Walks</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature lets the users make a one-time booking and schedule regular walks for a longer time span. This is a convenient feature for those who for some reason or other can not go take their pet dogs for regular walks.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Push Notifications</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, push notifications are important because how else would the user stay alerted about everything? From the walker picking up the dog to all the actions that happen on the walk, cancellation, successful bookings, payment confirmation, all the information needs to reach the user in a convenient way. </span></p>
<h2 id="Advanced_features_to_make_your_app_stand_out"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Advanced And Unique Features for On-demand Dog Walking App Development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the above features are the very basic features of an on demand dog walking app, your app needs some advanced features to truly stand out and become one of the top dog walking apps. So let’s see what kind of advanced features you need for your app to stand out for the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/">mobile app development</a> for dog walking.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Filtering Feature</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature is going to help both the owners and dog walkers to filter and sort through the walkers and walk requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a much needed yet much-ignored feature. The dog owners can filter out walkers depending on various factors and choose one from the pool of walkers they prefer. The walkers too can choose and filter through assigned dogs based on the area and dog breeds. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Curated Professional Advice</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be a valuable feature for those first-time dog parents. With daily tips on grooming, training, and diets, the daily tips and notes from professional vets, trainers and groomers can be very useful to the dog parents. Extra points if these daily tips can be modified to match specific breeds of dogs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Doggy Playdate</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like human beings, dogs too need daily socializing. While dog parks can be a great place for this, often there are bigger dogs there who can intimidate all the other dogs and ruin the fun.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11060 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dog-playdate-on-app.jpg" alt="play date in on demand dog walking app " width="640" height="439" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dog-playdate-on-app.jpg 640w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dog-playdate-on-app-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why being able to set up a dog playdate can be an amazing way for the pet parents to set up playdates between two or more dogs so that they can get the much-needed socialization they need. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Sales &amp; Events Notifications </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can be notified whenever there are any specific events or sales going on nearby. This will not only be a fun way to spend time with their dogs but also help the owners to meet other dog owners. Events such as dog show, special training campaign, service dog training, along with a sale on toys and dog food can be included in this feature. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Community Feature</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group or community feature can help the dog parents and walkers on the platform to come together in one group and exchange information about caring for dogs and important notifications. This will be a good way for everyone to communicate with each other.</span></p>
<h2 id="UX_design_needs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing An Attractive UI/UX to Create Your Dog Walking App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it is a dog walking app, you need to pay enough attention to the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/">UI/UX design</a>. The ease and flow of the user interface will determine whether the user is going to come back to your app next time they need a dog walker or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that the User interface is easy to understand and navigate through. Booking a dog walker is not going to be as easy as ordering a cap or food. Even though the app model is a lot similar, the interface design needs to be different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there are going to be a lot of details to put in regarding the owner and the dog as well, make the forms precise and easy to understand. No need for fancy use of language or extra images. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that at the end of the day it is an app for busy dog parents to get a walker for their dogs in an efficient way. They are not going to be impressed with extra <strong>effects</strong> and <strong>animation</strong> if it does not help them to schedule a walk quickly. </span></p>
<h2 id="Extra_security_Necessities"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Safety Measures To Take &#8211; Make Your App Secure</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dog service app still poses a lot of security risks to both the dog parents and the walkers. And to make it more secure for them, you should integrate some extra security features when you go for on-demand dog walking app development.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Background Checks For The Walkers </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been more than one </span><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/dog-stolen-wag-walker" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where the pet care provider from popular dog walking services fell short of the quality these companies promised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering all the weird incidents that created headlines like </span><a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2345986/cautionary-tale-about-dog-walking-apps" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dog-walking apps have a shaky reputation among the users. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Safe Way To Hand Over The Keys </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, the dog walkers booked through the app are arriving at your apartment when you are not home. In such a case, they need access to your apartment. Apps like Wag! Provide the owners with a lockbox, with a security code facility. The users keep the keys of their apartment inside this box and lock it with a code. The security code is only shared with the walker books, through the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though this system seems full-proof, it isn’t. There have been many </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-thinks-robber-accessed-home-dog-walking-app/story?id=65405550" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">instances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where the dog walkers, with access to the security code, have robbed the house. And that’s why you need a safer way of handing over the keys. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Insurance For Pets And The House</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pet-owner-blames-death-of-her-dog-on-rover-app/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tragic incident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the pet parent left their blind dog with a sitter booked through one of the popular dog walking uber app, but the dog fell off of a two-story building and passed away. Not to mention the various robbery incidents that have happened to many dog owners. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Live Cam And Photo Posting Feature During The Walk</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The live cam and photo sharing feature can actually guarantee the real-time safety and security of the beloved pet. Having the dog walker go live through the app when they are picking the pup up for the walk and dropping them back home, can satisfy users to know that their dog is safe and sound. </span></p>
<h2 id="How_to_earn_from_your_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. How To Earn From Your App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the main aim of creating an app is to monetize it. And we take care of this in our dog walking app solution. When it comes to monetizing an app for dog care on demand, you need to know about the various monetization models. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Make Money With Marketplace Model</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You create a platform, where all the other pet care providers can register and get bookings independently. All they have to do is pay a small charge to the platform for every booking and sitting completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is basically a peer to peer-based payment model which helps the users to pay for the pet care service to the walker through the app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Create Your Pet Care Agency App &#8211; The Agency Model</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is another model for this app, which is the agency model. With this model of monetization, you hire pet sitters and walkers, provide extensive training and eventually employ them as pet care providers. Unlike the marketplace model, the walkers here are not independent workers, rather they would work under your platform. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/top-app-monetization-ideas/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10809 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-monetization-ideas.jpg" alt="on demand dog walking app development" width="635" height="146" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-monetization-ideas.jpg 635w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-monetization-ideas-300x69.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. One Time Sign Up Fee</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is for both service providers and pet parents. Having them pay a one-time signup fee would not only help you to raise revenue, but it will also help them take advantage of the various features of your platform.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Annual Fees For Users</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recurring annual fee to get access to premium features is a common monetization model for the most on-demand app. And that’s why utilizing it for your app can be a great way of raising revenue</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Product Advertisement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can easily monetize your app by showing relevant advertisements to the users. Getting into paid partnerships with various dog food or dog toy companies. However, make sure before you get into a partnership that the company is reliable and doesn’t endorse any kind of harmful product to the pet parents. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">“An approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms” – Martin Fowler</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There could be numerous possible approaches to build up an enterprise application. However, complexity somehow figures out how to sneak into the development procedure. Nobody other than the developer would have the capacity to comprehend this pain better. In the event that you are attempting to keep specialized groups moving quick. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to search for a superior method for getting things done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the microservices architectural style isn&#8217;t a youthful idea, it has picked up some popularity in the course of recent years. Despite technology, it&#8217;s a procedure driven approach used to decompose monolithic applications (traditionally organized applications) into smaller pieces (also called microservices). These little pieces, which are only sensible individual services, are manufacturing and managed autonomously to play out a specific job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Digital transformation</strong> — Digital change, an intriguing issue for organizations over the globe, is the utilization of innovation. It happens due to profoundly enhance execution or reach of businesses. Although digital transformation isn&#8217;t about digital technologies accordingly.

Big Data (analytics), cognitive figuring and the Internet of Things (IoT), to give some examples, accelerate changes across society. These advanced innovations have changed conventional work processes and have empowered organizations to end up systems of computerized digital workflows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital transformation happens all over and in every industry. It can likewise influence all exercises, divisions, capacities, and procedures of the association.

So, it is an interconnected and silios have less (or no) put, not from a mechanical point of view but rather above all additionally not from a procedure and people perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The expression &#8220;Microservice Architecture&#8221; has jumped up finished the most recent couple of years to portray a specific method for planning programming applications as suites of autonomously deployable services. While there is no exact meaning of this engineering style, there are sure basic attributes around organizations, business capacity, mechanized sending, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized control of languages and data.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Transforming Customer Experience</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Customer Understanding</strong> — Many enterprises are building investigation ability to understand customers in more detail.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">So, if you have been thinking that in your next project you are surely going to impress the client by delivering a bug-free mobile application, then you are wrong probably. It’s a myth that exists in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/" target="_blank">mobile app development in Casablanca</a>. There can never be a single application, which runs without any bugs. Small security problems, bad network connections, handling privacy settings and validating user inputs are some of the common problems, which arises while developing an app. However, with the right strategy, one can easily overcome them to ensure a less bug-free mobile application.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Security Issues In Mobile App Development</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Numerous studies related to mobile application bugs reveal that software bugs support 40% of failures, whereas 60% of them are security issues in an app. Hence, improving the security of an app is the primary way to enhance the reliability of a mobile app. To immune an app from getting vulnerable to virus attacks or any kind of security breach, developers use many tools and imply technology to deliver the best mobile app development in USA. Testing plays an important role here. A properly tested app is a guarantee of a robust product. It creates faith and trust in a client, as he gets an assurity of a quality product.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Identifying architectural flaws and other security weak spots are simultaneous tasks in mobile app development. This starts from the beginning stages of testing to avoid the humongous process of retesting while sending the final application to the client. As a developer, the task not only lies in debugging the issues but also ensures that no third party gets access to sensitive user information. To leave no room for errors, sometimes developers use code from other developers. Though this practice is not illegal, but one should always use the code depending upon the app’s requirements. In a nutshell, reading the code carefully before writing it, is necessary from a developer’s end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Coming to mobile app security, there are three critical problems, which a developer has to solve – making a device risk free, prevent sensitive data leakage and restriction of risk related transactions. A risk-free device may be susceptible to risk at the time when it allows an app to access all the personal details of a user. As a developer, one can set limits to it and allow only some selected apps to do it. Coming to data leakage, businesses may fall prey to sensitive data leakage. Here, an option for cloud storage would act as the ultimate security measure.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Ensuring A Bug-Free Mobile App Development</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As discussed in the beginning of this blog that ensuring a completely bug-free mobile app is not possible. However, as a developer, one can take steps that minimum bugs remain from his end. As a leading firm for mobile app development in USA, we’re here to guide you through the mobile app development process that ensures fewer bugs from the developer’s side.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do Code Reviews &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reviewing a code from another or a group of developers brings out many fallacies. If you skip something in the middle, another technical person can catch it quickly. Many companies depend on pair programming. Here, two developers write a code simultaneously. The use of code reviews is immensely important in those apps where the role of security related code comes to usage. Hence, advanced coding facilitates in leaving fewer bugs in an app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Go For Beta Tests &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Releasing the beta version is the most common way of testing the acceptance of your mobile apps by the end user. The benefit is that you can test the application again and again to find more relevant bugs. Users might find issues with different versions of operating systems installed in their systems. Hence, this eases the work of developer for finding bugs. Just make sure that your app has all the functionalities before you give it for the final testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rely On Automated Tests &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Want to test application programming interfaces, user interfaces and application modules? automated tests are the perfect ones to go for. It is not necessary for you to be a good tester to make the best use of automated tests. In fact, you can take the help of unit testing for developing the important parts of the application. Plenty of unit testing frameworks is available which one can make use of.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Handling Error Reports &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before you sit down to resolve the issues, determine the kind of problems your users are experiencing. If you have an application, which runs on the trial version, then remember that users won’t get in touch with you. Use automated error and reporting techniques in order to make the process of testing easier. While preparing error reports, one should identify the problem, include log files and version numbers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employ Dedicated Testers &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quality assurance is an important thing in mobile app development in USA. You must have numerous testers particularly dedicated for a single project. Sometimes, applications are too complicated and require the competency of experienced testers. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to financially support testers. In such a situation, one develops can test each other’s code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Virtual Machines &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make a robust application requires you to test it on numerous operating systems and various environments. Apart from testing the application, you will get a plenty of time to test it in various virtual machines. For various operating systems, it is good to make images of standard sizes, test them and then finally upload them on the server. Whenever you want to test, you can use the base images without even installing the OS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Good Debugger &#8211; </strong><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Various web app development platforms such as Python, Ruby and PHP make it difficult to debug. So, an IDE like Visual Studio will give you the best strategy. With a good debugger, you can neutralize the risk of development. No need to identify or solve bugs, changing code parts and a few print statements will do that easily.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Wrap Up</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Making a mobile application completely bug free is like shooting an arrow at an unidentified object. There will be some issues anywhere or the other. However, as a developer, one can always reduce the number of bugs to bring more stability in the mobile app development in USA.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">For mobile developers who are looking to extend the functionality of an application in more than one platform without changing the tool set and language of the platform, Apache Cordova comes as an instant solution to them. With the growing demand of mobile application around the world and the rapid advancement of mobile app development (where mobile app downloads are expected to reach 268.69 billion by 2017 as per this Statista report) the demand for innovative mobile apps are fuelling the rise of advance mobile technology frameworks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/robustness-of-hybrid-mobile-application-development-and-its-utility/">mobile app development industry is growing</a> by leaps and bounds today, there are some robust technologies which are making it possible to develop scalable applications. One of them is Apache Cordova. Throughout this blog, we are going to analyze how can this mobile framework contribute towards making the app development process more advance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Brief Outlook of Cordova</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The emergence of Cordova is due to the need of such an open source mobile development framework that would work even while developing a cross platform development app. It removes the hassles of relying on APIs of iOS, Windows or an Android; instead, it helps mobile app developers to make an app using HTML 5, CSS3 and JavaScript.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Which Development Paths To Follow?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before you start developing an app in any OS, it is important to know which development paths are you going to use. Well, there are two main workflows which you can follow – Cross platform Workflow (CLI) and Platform Centered Workflow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cross Platform Workflow, as the name suggests can be used to run an application in various operating systems. It is mainly centered around Cordova. Web assets with similar sets are copied and transferred into subdirectories in separate mobile platforms. The developer can also use a different set of plugins on a common interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, platform centered workflow, can be used if you want to combine the custom native components along with the Cordova components. Here, lower level shell scripts are used for each platforms. Plugins are available for each one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To give you an idea of the Cordova architecture for developing a mobile app or web app, we are presenting you with an exclusive graphic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Simplifying The Mobile App Development Process</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cordova eases the process of mobile app development by offering an array of benefits. Take a look at them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Implementing  Modern Web Technologies:</strong> In the beginning of this blog, you might have come to know about the use of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3. Well, it might be difficult for a developer to adopt to Cordova, he or she can at the same time learn modern technologies like AngularJS and JQuery as they are used often in Cordova.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saves Coding Time:</strong> In Cordova, one can write the same code in various platforms. One doesn’t have to face the problem of porting as no changes are required to be made. As a result, the development time can be reduced to a large extent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>UI Problems Solved:</strong> Browsing a website in a Smartphone might be at times cumbersome as the user has to scroll through a web page thus making it a difficult process. Cordova comes loaded with multiple libraries that makes user interface an interactive and engaging experience for the users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advanced Plugins:</strong> In order to make a native app, you require multiple plug in, but in Cordova a number of plugins are already included. As a result, the developer is empowered with accessing special features such as determining the current location, accessing the file paths and many more. Another benefit of Cordova is that it has a number of community plugins, which makes it easier for the developers to manage any issue within the app with complete ease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Things to Consider to Make a Cordova based iOS or Android App</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, iOS and Android are the two most popular mobile operating systems that exists around the world. Keeping Cordova at the backend and using it as a framework offers some exceptional benefits to both these operating systems, but at the same time it is important to keep in mind some important things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s take a look…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Plugins Intelligently:</strong> Since Cordova comes with considerably less number of APIs, it is important that to add some plugins. You can search them in the Cordova Plugin Registry; they provide an easy access to the geo location, Camera and Battery, that are supported across multiple platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Decide About The Versions:</strong> Are you going to use Cordova in the recently released iOS 9 or Android Nouget? all the third party plugins are pretty advanced in Cordova, hence it is important to check that whether the operating system which you are using support such plugins or not. You can even add various platform versions in order to simplify the CSS selectors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Form Factors To Consider:</strong> As far as the forms are concerned, keep in mind about responsiveness as the whole world today accesses a website either through a tablet or a Smartphone. Moreover, the designers as well as the testers should be aware about the methodologies to be applied for developing apps both for iOS and Android.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Offline Support Is Important:</strong> While making a Cordova based iOS or Android application you must keep in mind about how a particular app is going to work that doesn’t need any internet connection. For instance: a calculator. In that case you can make use of the Cordova Network connection in order handle the connection issue properly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Testing Matters:</strong> It is a known fact that emulators or simulators fasten the process of testing a mobile application, but one cannot ignore the usability of real time testing. A real device might be more effective in handling bugs or issues as compared to the manual devices, which are already available. Debugging Corodova based application can at times be difficult but if you are accustomed with Safari and Chrome, then nothing beats that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cordova not only simplifies the app development process, but it saves the development time to a considerable extent. We recommend to the developers that they use an existing framework while making an application. Doing this will not only structure the application but will also add a number of components that will give the mobile application a more native look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to develop a robust Cordova based iOS or Android app, then write us a mail at <a href="mailto:info@unifiedinfotech.net">info@unifiedinfotech.net</a> with your requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">You probably know whom to blame if you have been glued to your mobile phone since the last one month. The addiction has reached to such a level that it has superseded Facebook as far as user engagement is concerned. Within a month of this augmented reality game, Pokémon is really riding high with more than 26 million daily users.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Let the stats speak for you</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The intensity of the game is such that previously even games like Temple Run, Candy Crash Saga have not witnessed such global acceptance at such a humongous level. Now looking at it from a business point of view and that too using it as a learning tool by a mobile app development company is something that will help business owners, marketing heads and each one in an organization to make further developments or bring any changes in the way they operate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, is it the social part or the fun factor attached with this game that makes it such a huge hit among the masses? Well, all mobile retailers around the world are giving a ball of time with this game and we being an app development company will let you know the different lessons that we can learn from Pokémon Go.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Go The Pokémon Way</strong></em></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 1: Make Mobile Ready Experiences </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of merely developing an app for enhancing the user experience in desktop or mobile web browsing, one should focus more on <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/react-native-app-development/">developing native apps</a> for making their services available to the end level customer. Here, it is important to study the choices and preferences of the target audience. Secondly, the uses of native apps enable any web page to open faster, which is a catalyst in increasing the engagement of the customer. Hence, higher conversions lead to increasing revenue.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 2: Synchronizing Online With Offline</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just as Pokemon Go merges a native app with a mobile device thus connecting the offline with online, in the same way, retailers can promote their product as a brand that can be enjoyed by the customer both at the retail store and in an ecommerce website as well. Merging the world of online and offline has resulted in more engagement. Thus, the concept of multi-channel and omni-channel is made use in just the perfect way. Once, you find a Pokemon, you enter in the virtual world. In the same way, to give a similar delightful experience to the users, retailers can optimize their channels.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 3: Innovation For More Engagement</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have been a Pokemon fan, then you must have known about its previous forms starting with a comic character to a movie and then to a toy. By innovating itself into an augmented reality app, it has utilized innovation to increase the user interaction. If the same principle is applied even in case of a mobile app development company. To make your mobile business a hit, you can also combine technology and be in the front line of companies, which is famous for innovation. Geo fencing can be one of the innovative measures that can be adopted.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 4: Branding Can Sell Everything</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if you have made one of the finest apps, then you won’t be able to make it popular, until and unless you are branding your product. Think about Pokemon, it has been in the market for more than 20 years, and still continues to rule, the reason? Good branding! So, this can be another takeaway for businesses that branding should form a major part in planning the marketing strategy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 5: Going Social Is The Weapon</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A business will not come in the public glare unless somebody knows and talks about it. No marketing tool is better than social media. Starting from Facebook to Tumblr, Twitter, Pinterest and YouTube, the Pokémon madness has spread everywhere. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/10-tips-to-running-a-successful-social-media-marketing-campaign/">This is the reason</a> why you, the whole world and me are talking about this.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Factors That Make Pokemon Such A Hit</strong></em></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Engaging To The Core</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have played the game, then you will know that there are no end to collecting the Pokemons. It is endless. In other games, you will find a pro version or certain levels that ask you to complete in order to reach to the final level. No such things are present in this game. As a result, the users find it more interesting that ultimately increases the engagement level.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Retaining Is the Key</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to create a strong retention in the mind of the users, Pokémon Go has a unique capture session. You will notice that each angle of Pokémon is different in different angles. The interesting thing to note here is that there is user-generated content behind each session. Moreover, the mastery curve is smooth enough to help you build an array of Pokémon, which will help you to advance in the game further.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Viral Makes It More Popular</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can go on inviting as much friends as you want in this augmented reality game. It allows you to read stories on the internet and know about the player’s experiences. There never has been a game such as this that has spread virally around the whole world. Since, it is related to an existing social graph, this is the reason why people have started liking it so much. Niantic, the maker of the game has more plans already to make the game more interactive in the real world.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Monetization Factor</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to monetization, there is no doubt in the fact that it is topping the lists of downloads in the app store. It is merely not an unending game, but also gives an opportunity to the player to earn money. By purchasing the license, one can increase the rate of capturing sessions. The players do not have to wait, instead they keep throwing at each other and at the same time enjoy a delightful experience.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Wrap Up!</em></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These lessons are precious for an organization that deals in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/">mobile app development</a>. Once you imply them, you will certainly witness an increase in the customer acquisition and retention. The key to successfully making your product popular among your customers is to market it well like Pokémon Go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From a basic communication device to using it as a virtual reality device, there are merely any functions left behind by mobile technology. By introducing extended capabilities, it has helped mankind to witness the technological upsurge in a rapid phase, but what lies next? Is there something more in store? Will mobile technology amaze us with new discoveries? Such questions are bound to come in our minds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout this blog, we will share with you the upcoming changes which you are all set to witness in the field of <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a> and how will mobile technology shape up the world in the years to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s put an end to all your curiosity and present to you the future of mobile technology which we and the coming generation are going to witness.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‘Augmented Reality’ Close To Reality</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Virtual Reality is making news everywhere, Augmented Reality is the next one in the line. Using the GPS on your smartphone to find the nearest restaurant or places of interest is a cliché now. Augmented Reality will enable users to find them offline just by activating their camera. Yes, this is going to be this easy. In the next few years, this feature will undergo many new transformations to give the user more relevant search results. Combining computer data and fetching it to the users in real time will be a challenging task, though, but nevertheless, it will pave the way for mobile app development.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Foldable Flexible Screens</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tired of carrying your large screen Smartphones everywhere? Why not fold it? Yes, the dream of carrying that large screen smartphone will finally come true as foldable screens will come in the near future to make your phone pocket-friendly. The Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) technology will make this possible. This means you can view from both sides of the phone and perform dual activities from both sides. If accepted well, by the masses, it can further evolve into a wearable device. Imagine you are wearing your smartphone on your wrist. An interesting concept. Isn’t it?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advanced Voice Control</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The voice recognition system will now be at its best. Many researches have been done in order to develop the quality of voice, but time and again it has proved to be a hectic task. Just as Siri introduced the system of voice recognition by interpreting the diction and syntax of the speech, in the same way, use of a natural user interface at a more advanced level will overtake the current way of communication. Seamless voice control will emerge as the next voice control app. Such kind of feature will increase the interactivity as far as Smartphones are concerned. Thus, this mobile technology will certainly prove to be the best.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Moving Beyond 3D Screens</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Apple has raised the bar with retina display, the introduction of 3D screens have brought forward crystal clear screen display by enabling the user to view from three dimensions. The more advanced level of viewing experience beyond 3D could be the use of holograms. This could totally change our viewing experience in a smartphone. Integrating the movements along with the 3D displays will allow you to compress or adjust the size of your pictures just with the help of a single touch.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What To Expect From Android In The Future ?</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than half of the mobile population around the world makes use of Android Smartphones.</p>
<h3><strong>1. An All New Google Map</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can expect a much more sophisticated version of the Google Maps with helpful features. Google is already in talks for hiring the street view cameras so that it can allow the users to get a clear inside view of a building or a monument. Detailing will be the primary focus of the app.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. More Secured Payments </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though many secured methods for payments have been adopted such as OTP and an SSL payment gateway, but in the near future, it is all set to get complicated, so that transaction becomes much easier. Fingerprint recognition and iris scanning can be the next process of payment.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Innovation In Hardware</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There could be a complete change in the hardware of your smartphone. As discussed in this blog earlier, that one could also see a foldable screen in the future. In future, Smartphones could be the new wearables and will completely change the way we communicate with a mobile.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What To Expect From iOS In The Future?</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the Worldwide Developer’s Conference, 2016, Tim Cook announced a number of technological upgrades apart from releasing iOS10.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Upgraded iMessaging </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the recently released version of iOS10, one can reply to a message instantly on receiving the notifications. In the near future, the focus of Apple will be to extend the concept of messaging to third parties. Moreover, the secondary focus will be mainly on increasing the font size and creating bigger emoticons.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Improving the User Interface</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In each version, Apple has upgraded its user interface, but what holds in the near future is really a matter of curiosity for iPhone lovers. Shifting to OLED screens is an indication that can change the user interface that Apple has been maintaining all the while. As a result, the user can benefit from saving the battery even in dark mode.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Richer Notifications  </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apple has taken a significant leap as far as adjusting the notifications are concerned. Media rich notifications will be the key agenda and no application will be required to open in order to view the notifications box. This up gradation will pull the user more towards installing the application.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Transformation For Business </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the years to come, mobile technology will have a transformational effect on the business. Starting from IT to marketing and corporate sector, it will have a chain of effects and will drastically change the way we work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rise Of The Virtual Office</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By 2020, it is expected that one doesn’t need to be physically present at the workstation. Digital space will overtake the cabins and desks. With the rapid evolution of video calls, messaging and email, business houses need to strategize in the most calculative manner in order to get the work done.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mobile Tech To Become A Real Player</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, most of the people around the world depend on a smartphone rather than on his laptop or computer. With the massive mobile user around the world, there is no doubt that in future, people are mostly going to use their mobile for all kinds of official work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ERP Systems To Rise</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The need to real time availability of business reports and data is becoming the need of the hour in this era of competitive business development. Everything must be at your fingertips every time. With the introduction of ERP, you will have access to custom reports from anywhere. Hence, this will ease the process of business development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile devices have revolutionized our life since their advent and it will continue to amaze us with their amazing impact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The mobile application industry is driven today by the need for big data, business intelligence, and analytics. The more tactical and strategic the app will be, the more will be its demand in the market. With rapid advancements made every day, it is quite evident that there will be more demand for such apps in the time to come. In order to live up to the growing demands of mobile application around the world, there is no wonder about the fact that many entrepreneurs are coming up across the world by setting up their own mobile app startup.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a budding entrepreneur, who is planning to start his or her own enterprise that makes a mobile app, then we are here to help you out with some basic things, which you must know and be aware of, once you start the business. At the end of this blog, you will come to know about the what, when and how facts, related to a startup of a <a title="mobile app development company" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank">mobile app development company</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, let us take a look at the various factors which you’ll have to take into account when you are all set to launch your mobile app business.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Difference Between Native And Cross Platform</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It depends on you which platform do you want to develop the app. Remember that whatever platform you choose has got its own set of coding rules. For an iOS app, the platform will be Objective – C, whereas for android app development, the platform will either be Java or HTML. If you are doing it for the first time, then it is recommended that you start testing it on a single platform. As far as multi- platform development is concerned, you can start it later.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Proper Platform Selection</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember, you have App store, Google Play, and Windows store to upload your apps. So, it depends on you where do you want to see your apps. Apple always pays more to those who want their app to be downloaded by charging fees. If you want to upload it on Windows store, you might not be able to earn much revenue. Google Store can be the ultimate solution in this case and poses a challenge to iTunes. As a newbie in the market, it is recommended that you put your app for sale on the app store.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Create Flawless Designs</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Designing is not a rocket science or a big task as you always think it to be. Include pixel-perfect graphics for all the images to be used in your app, use big buttons and icons, test your design in multiple formats such as X HDMI, hope, dpi and make sure that your icons and fonts should always be big irrespective of the screen size. It is always a wise decision to hire an expert designer first and then decide the final icons or layout.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Secret to Retain Clients</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you are in the mobile app development business, the best way to retain your clients is to make simple applications. Refrain from including annoying pop-ups in between apps, or else, if you really want to include the ads then ask the permission of the users on the app description page itself. Keep updating your app after taking feedback from them about the app. The last thing to remember is to keep the process of login as easier as you can. Even a simple Facebook login can be of help.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Apply Clever Marketing Strategies</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to marketing, use the four weapons of product description, brand awareness, SEO and intelligence gathering. Instead of simply writing about your app, write a persuasive sales letter that will pique interest among the readers. As far as intelligence gathering is concerned, follow what your competitors are doing. Promote your mobile app by sharing it on social media platforms as a brand. Try to provide as many backlinks as possible for your app.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Monetize Your App</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now there are three ways to monetize your app – sell the USP of your app, give it for free download or sell it in an app store at a fixed price. Another interesting way might be to have two versions of the app which are the pro version and the free version. You can charge for the pro version and allow the other version for a free download.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Factors That Could Pose As A Hindrance</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since you are starting out your venture for the first time, you might make some mistakes, which can cost you dollars. We present to you some of the factors that could limit the growth of your mobile app startup.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Authenticating A Mobile App With Mobile Web</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the entrepreneurs who are new in the mobile app industry often make the mistake of authenticating a mobile application through mobile web. It is important to understand here that the speed and functionality of the mobile app are impossible to match with a mobile web. One may find a mobile website while browsing through the Google search results, but a mobile app is confined only within the walls of Windows, Android, and iOS. Hence using a mobile app through a mobile web will give you wrong data.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ignoring The Core Features In The First Version</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Merely including a handful of features in an app is not something that people would expect from an app. What the user is really concerned about is to the extent to which the app solves the problem. The core feature of your app should always focus on solving the problem of the user. Once you are able to incorporate that it will become easier for you to sell your app.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing Cross Platform</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is no doubt one of the best platforms for developing an application, but if you use such technologies then the most important thing which you will miss is the satisfaction in user experience. It is important to understand that there lies a difference in developing an app using one&#8217;s own platform and using a third-party app. Moreover, when you are developing a mobile app on your own platform, you can independently rely on the developers to fix any issues or bugs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>To Sum It Up…</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting a mobile app business is not a risky affair at all, but at the same time, you have to keep in mind not only about the budget but develop the app that solves the problems of the user who is going to make use of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The term ‘communication heavy internet services’ might sound alien to you, but not too big IT giants like Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft. In fact, the term can be termed as a source of revenue generation for them. The gradual shift from display-based information through programs to browser-based information has a huge role to play in the age of digital transformation. As we are blazing forward in this age software based technologies, data is becoming outdated and is in the dire necessity for usage of the more sophisticated storage platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The challenges prevailing in the online industry are being replaced easily with cloud computing. This rapid development is characterized by advancements made in technology such as the introduction of more disk storage, faster internet access, and inexpensive servers. All of these are pushing the concept of cloud computing forward in such a way that by 2020, the cloud market is going to earn a revenue of nearly $55 billion as per a report published by International Trade Administration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Native cloud apps, the new name in the <a title="Mobile App Development" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a> world is of immense benefit from the developer’s perspective. Apart fro <span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1.  <strong>Automatic Management Of Resources</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any third party application, the resources that are to be used in making an app are provided to the developers. A native cloud application enables a developer to take advantage of the resources as they are automatically available. With self-service, programmatic provisioning and on-demand allocation of resources, all critical business applications run quite smoothly. Such kind of application can handle the task of pooling the resources, managing the data analytics very swiftly.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2.  <strong>Easily Manage Business Needs</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is an ‘auto scale’ feature, which is available in the native cloud applications. In case of any emergency situation such as a complicated up down process, it enables the enterprises to come up with a solution easily. Hence, by paying only for computing resources, an enterprise can provide backup for its business needs quite easily.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3.  <strong>Minimize Risk Failure</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the powerful benefits of using such kinds of apps is that they can tackle outages and make corrective actions in case of app failure. The application processing moves from one data center to the other without causing any disruption in the service and the surprising thing is that the user doesn’t even come to know that whether there was even an outage or not while running the application.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Cloud Native Apps And App Architecture</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a direct co-relation between the native cloud and the architecture of an app. These two often prove to be the best combination and help to develop an app in the most sophisticated manner. Now let’s see how do they help to improve an app’s architecture.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1.  <strong>Advanced Frameworks</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The infrastructure used in a native cloud app is based on container driven architecture and highly automated infrastructure. This is the reason why the software runs so easily which is developed with a native cloud app. The basic mechanism that works behind this is the single code base that helps to organize from many environments using a single codebase. Moreover, the presence of cloud as a platform helps to declare the dependency in a more organized manner.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong>Better App Run Times</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What makes such apps a hot favorite is the use of the containers. Being lightweight by nature, such apps work well in a cloud-ready environment by improving resource efficiency as well as fastening the process of mobile app development. In the development stage, the presence of a container reduces the time of a developer to write codes and create a developer oriented cloud apps. Thus, a developer can have full control over the resources each time he or she develops an app.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. <strong>Improved Infrastructure For Automation</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The robust automation process of native cloud apps does everything starting from updating routers to provisioning services by deploying apps and managing the log aggregation activities. It also serves as an excellent platform for managing the elasticity of computational resources. These advanced automation practices help the developer to avoid the extra task of deploying each node of the app infrastructure.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. <strong>Complete Control Over Documents</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as data security is concerned, cloud computing is no doubt the ultimate solution as it helps to protect your data in a safe manner, but did you ever wonder how it helps to improve the security of an app. All the important documents related to mobile application development are stored in the most secure manner in the cloud. Since the files are stored centrally in one server, it streamlines the process of development. No matter who accesses the machine of your organization, you can be at complete peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is due to the looming deadlines of clients that make a native cloud app so much popular. Since the architecture of an app plays a key role while making one, it is vital that one should make use of the most robust technologies and dynamic databases that are supported by cloud.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>The Future Ahead</strong></em>…</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as the software delivery capabilities are concerned, cloud-based native applications will help to transform the capabilities of an IT organization and help it emerge as a strong player amidst the competitive market. Developers are the ones who will be benefitted the most with such kinds of technologies. Hence, a bright future lies ahead for native cloud apps.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/about/contact/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12790 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6-1024x745.jpg" alt="online education" width="1024" height="745" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6-1536x1117.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. Is Investing in LMS Development Worth Your Money? &#8211; Validate Your Idea</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wondering what is an LMS website?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A smart learning management system makes the onerous administrative tasks smoother. Such a system makes tracking and reporting easier than ever for businesses. Also, delivering lessons and courses and conducting tests become significantly easier.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Idea validation is the first step we apply when developing an LMS web platform. Proceeding to develop an idea without learning about its value in the market can be extremely damaging to the business.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what kind of data are we looking at when validating the idea to create an LMS website?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This step requires a research process that includes both statistics research and industry research. Through statistics research on how to create a learning platform, we checked out some numbers online to ensure the success rates of such a website. And with industry-based research, we looked at the various application of an LMS website. Let’s find out the results of this research, shall we?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During this pandemic, the demand for LMS platforms has increased, with different industries making use of such websites in different ways.</p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Top Three Industries That Have Unexpectedly Embraced LMS Platforms</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is usual for education or manufacturing to embrace the trend of online education platforms, considering the number of benefits. But there are a few unexpected industries that are also making use of this technology in some unique manner.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. LMS &amp; Hospitality</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Recently hospitality LMS market has grown quite big, all because of this industry’s need to follow the compliance rules. The hospitality industry needs to follow the strict compliance rules related to customer security and safety.</p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. What Are The Numbers Telling Us?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once industry outlook is done with, we check out some stats about the growth of these platforms in the future.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11750" style="width: 619px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11750 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LMS-eLearning-market.png" alt="Create Learning management system stats" width="619" height="500" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LMS-eLearning-market.png 619w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LMS-eLearning-market-300x242.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11750" class="wp-caption-text">Source: FinancesOnline</figcaption></figure>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>According to the <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/learning-management-systems-market-1266.html">MarketsandMarkets</a> report, this industry has experienced a steady growth of 5% over the last 3 years. This report mentioned that by 2021, the global market of this industry would increase to almost $15.72 billion. By 2023, the global market value of it would reach almost $22.4 billion.</li>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">No wonder everyone wants to know how to develop and launch a learning management system. So with that positive note, let’s move onto the process we apply to build an LMS website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A Glimpse of LMS Adoption and Use Statistics</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far, you got to know about the market opportunities before you create LMS website. Now, time to look at the LMS adoption and use stats. Also, it will give you an idea of who needs a learning management system development.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11751" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11751" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11751 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LMS-and-eLeraning-Stat.jpg" alt="LMS and eLeraning Stat" width="768" height="576" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LMS-and-eLeraning-Stat.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LMS-and-eLeraning-Stat-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11751" class="wp-caption-text">Source: SmallBizTrends</figcaption></figure>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Tech Pro Research report says that 74% of employees of the businesses that are already using LMS systems, enjoy the benefits of the BYOD policy. It enables them to learn from their own devices in their comfort zone.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">According to a report by Forbes, in 2018, plenty of organizations invested a huge amount of money into learning and development. The main objective was to fill up the skill gaps along with reaching the full capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">No wonder why investing in the LMS website design and development is so popular these days. Want to know in detail how to build a learning management system? Read on.</p>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. Start with Creating An LMS Project Plan &#8211; First Answer to How to Build a Learning Management System</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">“<i>A goal without a plan is just a wish</i>.” &#8211; Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once the idea has been validated, we focus on the next step to create an LMS website which is planning. From our experience, we can guarantee you that a well-sorted plan is a key to any kind of successful development, and LMS web development is not an exception.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11752" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11752" style="width: 1186px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11752 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/planning.png" alt="create LMS website" width="1186" height="461" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/planning.png 1186w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/planning-300x117.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/planning-768x299.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/planning-1024x398.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1186px) 100vw, 1186px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11752" class="wp-caption-text">Our Planning at Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, what kind of questions should the project plan answer? Here is the list of questions we follow, but you can create new questions based on consultation.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you need to create LMS website?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">What problems currently your organization is facing and how this LMS will solve it?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Who will build the LMS from scratch?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Who will take care of the LMS implementation?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">How much you are ready to invest in the learning management system development?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are various other questions you might ask about LMS website design and development. However, with proper consultation, this phase can be even smoother and yield more information for the project. And the more information you have, the better the process will go.</p>
<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: left;">5. The Features We Consider Crucial (and You Should Too)</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">What comes after planning?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once we have a well-sorted plan, the next step to create LMS from scratch will be to sort the features. This detailed list needs to include the commonest features as well as some unique features that will make the platform stand apart. What are these features? Let’s check them out together.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Course Builder</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keeping the main objective in mind i.e. giving proper training to the employees, this feature is a must-include. With it, you can create all the necessary courses. Be it any topic-specific course, or quiz &#8211; you can create using this feature.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Certification or Skills Tracking</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Training the employees is great! But, how to measure their performance? Without a proper visual tracking feature, measuring employee skills and training is impossible.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12728" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12728" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12728 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/quizzes.jpg" alt="skill tracking when you create an LMS" width="825" height="596" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/quizzes.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/quizzes-300x217.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/quizzes-768x555.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12728" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p>And that’s why the course management system needs a tracking feature.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Asynchronous Learning to create LMS website</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This feature will allow the learners to learn at their own pace. See, giving training to your employees is not the same thing as teaching students at an elementary school. So, attending fixed-time lectures or classes is not very feasible for the employees.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12731" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12731" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12731 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/my_profile.jpg" alt="varied learning options" width="825" height="631" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/my_profile.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/my_profile-300x229.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/my_profile-768x587.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12731" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">This feature makes sure that the learners can gather all the study materials and complete the course at their own pace.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">D. Mobile Learning</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Different users are going to use different devices, and that’s why we are strong believers of platform flexibility. Learners should be able to take the courses from their preferable devices. And featuring mobile capabilities is a must here. This feature is helpful when someone decides to take a course on an off-day.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12730" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12730" style="width: 403px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12730 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/mobile-version.png" alt="mobile version for LMS" width="403" height="688" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/mobile-version.png 403w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/mobile-version-176x300.png 176w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12730" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also, it is effective for distributed teams.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">E. Video Conferencing</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes just study materials are not enough. Maybe an employee or a student needs to have a one-on-one interaction with the instructor. Yes, emails and messaging boards will definitely be there. Still, the video conferencing feature is a must-include in your smart learning management system development.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12729" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12729" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12729 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/video.jpg" alt="create LMS website with video conferencing feature" width="825" height="850" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/video.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/video-291x300.jpg 291w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/video-768x791.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12729" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes face-to-face interaction is better for easy understandings.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">F. Gamification</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Theoretically, learning for the sake of learning sounds like a great idea! But we know that continuous training without any fun is boring. To make the learning process more interesting, the LMS should include gamification.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12732" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12732" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12732 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/course_activity.jpg" alt="create LMS website with course activity" width="825" height="596" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/course_activity.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/course_activity-300x217.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/course_activity-768x555.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12732" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Obviously, the subject matter of the course won’t become easier with it. But the learning process will become easier. Gamification will keep the learners engaged. Also, it will make sure they can cover the modules faster along with increasing compliance.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">G. Social Learning</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Giving a community experience to the learners will enhance the overall learning process. With this feature, learners can communicate with each other over any topic or confusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Suppose A has a question in mind and he can post it in the forum. Now, M knows the answer and can tell him how to overcome the issue. Thus, the pressure on the trainer is reduced a bit. Now, others can take part in the discussion as well.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12734" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12734" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12734 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/social-media-refer-1024x571.png" alt="create LMS website design with refer a friend feature" width="1024" height="571" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/social-media-refer-1024x571.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/social-media-refer-300x167.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/social-media-refer-768x428.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/social-media-refer.png 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12734" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p>Various studies have shown that social learning is a very effective way to learn something new. So, you should include this feature when you create LMS website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">H. Subscriptions and eCommerce in LMS</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remember when we talked about having some unique features on the site? Well, here it is. It is possible to integrate <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/">eCommerce </a>options on your LMS website. If you want to publish your own study materials to a broader audience, this feature is a must-have. This is a popular monetizing method with the learning management system.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These are only a few of the features we like to consider during the development of an LMS website. However, if you have a specific requirement, then simply talk to the learning management system development partner on what feature might be needed.</p>
<h2 id="id_6" style="text-align: left;">6. How To Chose The Perfect US-Based LMS Web Development Partner?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Choosing an <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">LMS website design &amp; development partner</a> is not an easy task. And choosing one that can fulfill your location-specific web demands is even harder. Depending on the location of the target clients, the design and development requirements can vary.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So how are you going to choose the right service provider who can help to build a platform that will fulfill all the US-based LMS requirements for your business venture? Here is a small list of how we help our clients with their US specific business needs.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Location-Specific Consultation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">One size of the shoe doesn’t fit all, and that is why we aim to provide location-specific consultation to our clients in the US. When it comes to the question “how to create a learning platform?” our main goal is to listen to the clients and their problems. And then we provide them ideas on how to solve the problem in such a way that it will be acceptable to the local users. The customize consultation is purely for the benefit of the business owner, and their users.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Focused Market Research</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">For location-based consultation, we need location-specific information. And that’s why our research process is focused on the geographical location of the target audience. To create LMS from scratch for US-based clients, we focus our research entirely on the US market, the growth of LMS in that market, the expectations and benefits of such a platform in the US, and how we can leverage all this information.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Keeping An Open Mind</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In order to solve any problem, keeping an open mind is crucial. And that’s why when talking to our clients on how to create LMS, we keep an open ear and an open mind, ready to accept and work with any kind of unexpected scenario. This is crucial because without an open mind about the problems and their solutions, it is easy to fall into a rut of the same old ‘not-so-innovative’ solution generation. And we refuse to do that. Hence why we approach the problem with an open mind, ready to tackle anything that comes along the way.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">D. Being There With The Full Team</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The strength of virtual communication technology is enough that you can communicate with an overseas team without any hassle. But being able to talk face to face about LMS website design and development is always better than any high-tech virtual communication methods.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our full team at Casablanca is ready to tackle everyday course management platform problems of our clients there all day long. The designers and developers there are experienced enough to take on the issues and complaints of the clients and work on them to improve the platform in the most efficient way possible.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">E. Inventing Solutions That Are Fit For The Local Users</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last, but definitely not least, we come to the matter of innovation. The US is a country of innovation, and in such a country, sticking to the status quo and churning out boring regular results is simply not going to work. And that’s why our focus when developing a solution for the LMS industry, remains on innovation. We look at the market, recognize the problem and the common solution everyone else is using, and then engineer our own solutions that are more unique and more efficient. This is just one of the many ways we aim to keep our clients ahead in the competition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, let’s at the required tech stacks for your LMS website development, shall we?</p>
<h2 id="id_7" style="text-align: left;">7. Make The Right Tech Stack Choices</h2>

<h2 id="id_8" style="text-align: left;">8. Smart Tips for Stellar LMS Website Design</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is an undeniable fact that LMS websites are taking over the traditional way of learning. Despite the amazing potential of your platform, without a proper design, it is going to fail. The solution? A robust design process that’s aimed to win over both the market and the users. Here is how we think the design approach for a WP learning management system should be like.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Ease of navigation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">For an LMS, navigational ease is a must-have quality. No matter who the target audience is, if the navigation of the site is not up to the mark it will suffer direly. Users should find it easy to navigate through the various pages, discovering courses, and learning without having to travel around without any direction.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12733" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12733" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12733 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/employee_profile.jpg" alt="create LMS website with profile design" width="825" height="599" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/employee_profile.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/employee_profile-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/employee_profile-768x558.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12733" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Without good navigation, the interest of the users on the course management platform will reduce to nothing.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Use of design psychology</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">No matter what kind of website it is, when it comes to design, we swear by design psychology. The application of well-established methods designed to create a better UX is something you shouldn’t be ignoring. From the use of whitespace to color psychology, each and every <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/psychology-of-web-design/">design psychology law</a> should be considered when designing the custom LMS development.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Following the Familiar patterns of design</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Too much uniqueness can be a fatal thing. And that’s why for the comfort of the users we like to give them some familiar features, such as the common ‘Z’ pattern of content on the page, or split page designs. These familiar patterns give users a certain amount of conforming and help them use the platform more efficiently.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">D. The matter of accessibility</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accessibility is a big issue right now. Through the integration of the right features and functionalities, we always make sure to make the design accessible to the people, regardless of the kind of disability they might have. Whether it is visual impairment or language difference, we have the custom learning management solutions for that.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">E. Optimizing content for higher engagement</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Content optimization is an important thing for LMS development. Without the right kind of content, the learning experience on the site is not exactly going to be as good as you hope for it to be. Hence why the content needs to be easy to understand, detailed, and remember. Without the right content, an LMS platform is sure to fall flat on its face in the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">Designing an LMS platform is a cakewalk, as long as you are working with the right team</a>. Our professional team of skilled designers can come up with the best instructional web design for the LMS.</p>
<h2 id="id_9" style="text-align: left;">9. Build the MVP for Your LMS Website</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">An MVP is the basic version of your entire LMS website. It contains only the core features and functionalities of the LMS. However, this MVP can solve users’ problems as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Full-fledged LMS development requires a massive investment of both time and money. On the other hand, the fully-functional MVP can be developed pretty fast with fewer resources. So you can guess which ones we are in favor of when going for a custom LMS development.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12723" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12723" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12723 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MVP.jpg" alt="create LMS website's mvp" width="825" height="430" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MVP.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MVP-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MVP-768x400.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12723" class="wp-caption-text">Unified Infotech&#8217;s idea</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">With an MVP, our LMS client can release their product in the market and get live review on what the users think of the platform and what more they want. Making further plans to create LMS website based on these demands is far better than creating a complete product, only to have it rejected. So rather than choosing to develop the full-featured product, let’s go with the MVP approach, to maximize the success of the LMS platform as well as minimizing the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-website/">cost of web development breakdown</a>.</p>
<h2 id="id_10" style="text-align: left;">10. Test and Launch After You Create LMS Website</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now we reach the final step- testing and launching the platform. Before we create LMS website and launch it, it is run through various tests to ensure the features and functionalities work perfectly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Releasing a product with bugs and technical glitches will be the death of the platform, right then and there. That is why you need to hire an agency with an expert team of QA professionals. They will be able to ensure the quality and integrity of the product throughout the LMS development process.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11761 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/schedule-planning-startup-launching-7376-1.jpg" alt="create LMS website and test it" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/schedule-planning-startup-launching-7376-1.jpg 1200w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/schedule-planning-startup-launching-7376-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/schedule-planning-startup-launching-7376-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/schedule-planning-startup-launching-7376-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here’s how our team of professional QA experts ensure the quality of the platforms.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Scrutinizing every individual functionality, visuals including the texts.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining a comprehensive QA checklist. It ensures all the design, content, assessment resources, functionalities, and compliances are in place.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Checking and ensuring every browser, device, and platform compatibility of the LMS website.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Performing regression testing after each sprint. It ensures the proper functioning of the previously approved sprints.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure concurrent user testing as well.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Developing learning management solutions is not a one-time thing. It needs to be continuously improved based on user reviews and data. And for continuous maintenance, you will need the right development partner. So make your choice wisely, because the matter of maintenance is going to determine the future growth of your platform.</p>
<h2 id="step9" style="text-align: left;">Bonus Point- How to Earn from Your LMS?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far, you have got to know how to create an LMS. Now, I’m going to discuss how can you earn from it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you have built the LMS to use it internally within your organization, then fine. Maybe your objective was to train and improve your employees’ skill set. So, you might not be interested in making money.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, If your objective is to make money out of it, here are the ways how you can do it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Blog Monetization</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">“<i>If you’re good at something never do it for free</i>”!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, if you want to share your knowledge and expertise through blogs, monetize it. You can create a worthy course. And then promote it in the blog that you’ve uploaded to the LMS.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Partner Certification</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can implement a paid certification program. Once users complete your course, you can provide professional certificates to them. Thus, the user can enhance his portfolio with your certificate. And in turn, you can make money out of it when you create LMS website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. LMS Reselling</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is another great way to make money out of your LMS. Suppose that your organization is a software solution provider. And you’ve built a course for research, training, and consulting services. It will enhance your employees’ skill set, fine. But you can become a reseller of this LMS as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thus, you can enjoy a great ROI.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Wrapping Up The Process to Create LMS Website</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The education industry is changing. It is getting out of its traditional cocoon and adopting futuristic technologies to become advanced.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> And to keep up with this speed of advancements, you need the best LMS design and development process you can get.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what are you waiting for? Start to create your own e-learning platform and start taking over the market. And in case you need help, just <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/about/contact/">contact us</a>, we are always here to help!</p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start!</span></p>
<h2 id="An_insight_into_the_AI_market_in_the_eCommerce_industry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Look Before You Leap &#8211; A Detailed Insight to AI market in eCommerce </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start the segment with an important stat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, by 2025, AI revenue is expected to reach almost </span><b><i>$36.8 billion in the global market</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the survey report by PwC, the power of AI is almost limitless. And </span><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/artificial-intelligence-predictions-2019.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2030, this futuristic technology can contribute up to over $15.7 trillion to the global economy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM has recently released a study report. And it says, in the next 3 years, the consumer product and retail industry will witness a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">40% to 80% increase in the AI-enabled smart automation adoption</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Insider has made another prediction. According to it, </span><a href="https://www.kdrrecruitment.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2020, 85% of the customer interactions will be done without a human</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, investing in AI is undoubtedly a profitable idea now. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11693" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11693" style="width: 574px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11693 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-business.png" alt="Ai in eCommerce business" width="574" height="514" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-business.png 574w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-business-300x269.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11693" class="wp-caption-text">Source: pwc.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, integrating AI in eCommerce businesses ensures 24/7 availability of services to its customers. Thus, businesses can keep their customers engaged even outside the usual business hours. Without a doubt, it helps in generating more leads. Also, it results in increased revenue growth. </span></p>
<h2 id="A_short_backstory"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. How It All Started &#8211; A Short Back Story</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, online businesses were paying the utmost importance in delivering top-notch user experience only. Trawling through pages after pages to find the right product is not at all feasible for the customers. The big players in this industry understood that. And accordingly, they put all their effort to come up with the easiest and slickest online store design. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11694 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/History-of-Artificial-Intelligence.jpg" alt="AI in eCommerce" width="802" height="420" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/History-of-Artificial-Intelligence.jpg 802w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/History-of-Artificial-Intelligence-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/History-of-Artificial-Intelligence-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the trend of a keyword-friendly search bar came into the picture. It helped the users to easily find relevant products based on the search queries. It was another revolutionary change in eCommerce websites and stores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely, UI/UX is still one of the most crucial success-determining factors for eCommerce businesses. However, time flies. And with that, the market demands change as well. Soon, the businesses understood that they need something more. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking customer behavior in an online store</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying the shopping pattern and accordingly, recommending other products to customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing customers with more personalized shopping experience, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the introduction of AI in the market, achieving all these goals have become more convenient. No wonder why AI has become a big hit in the eCommerce industry these days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, already a handful of online businesses are leveraging the power of this advanced technology. And many others are already working on adopting it with its full potential.</span></p>
<h2 id="How_is_AI_transforming_the_eCommerce_industry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. How is AI Transforming the eCommerce Businesses? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, you’ve seen how it all started with AI in eCommerce. Also, you have got to know how it is expected to grow beyond your expectations in the coming years. But how? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here it is!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Voice Assistants </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI has blessed industry-specific businesses with voice assistants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we buy any product online, we compare similar product features and prices, right? But typing in Google and searching for it is too old-fashioned now. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are living in the era of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Assistant</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siri</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Be it any product or service &#8211; whatever you are looking for, is just one command away today. Yes, AI-enabled voice assistants have made it possible. Now, don’t you think implementing such voice assistants in your online store would be great?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would not only help you to deliver a stellar shopping experience to your customers. But it will help you to stay ahead of your competitors as well in today’s vying business market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a glimpse into a few stats on voice assistants.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the report by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quoracreative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stats, </span><a href="https://quoracreative.com/article/voice-search-statistics-trends"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2020, 50% of all internet-based searches will be done using voice assistants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To buy a product or service via voice commerce, almost 62% of users use voice assistants.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., 30% of internet users use AI-enabled voice assistants to purchase a product or to find information on a product. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, this is the time you too should go for implementing voice assistants in your eCommerce store. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Chatbots </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s busy lifestyle, no one likes to wait forever! Suppose a visitor has some queries in mind before making a product purchase. Now, your eCommerce site visitors would expect lightning-fast responses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is quite impossible to handle by a human. Unless you get such dedicated employees who will be always there to respond to the queries without even taking a break. Now, what if a query comes at an unusual business hour. Or, what if thousands of queries come at the same time! Sounds complicated, right? This is where you need chatbots. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11696 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chatbots-min-e1583931373423.jpg" alt="Ai in ecommerce" width="2000" height="1825" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chatbots-min-e1583931373423.jpg 2000w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chatbots-min-e1583931373423-300x274.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chatbots-min-e1583931373423-768x701.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chatbots-min-e1583931373423-1024x934.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots can handle multiple queries at the same time. More interestingly, such automated programs can simulate ‘humanly’ conversations. These chatbots can be the perfect shopping assistants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking from a retailer’s perspective, integrating it is a great idea. It not only reduces effort but cost as well. At the same time, it enhances the customer experience. This is why most online businesses are reaching companies that work with AI and bring revolution in </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce web development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know some globally popular websites are already enjoying the benefits of implementing AI chatbots? Well, big names like Amazon, eBay, Starbucks, etc. are included in this list. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Personalized Recommendations </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product recommendation is the reflection of visitors’ activities on an eCommerce website. Also, it is done based on the previous purchases a visitor has done. But the question is how?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, AI helps to track what a visitor is looking for or what purchase is being done. Based on the visitor’s preferences, it shows smart product suggestions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you are buying a mobile phone from an eCommerce site. Now, using the AI-powered recommendations, the site will show you suitable phone covers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s consider another example. Suppose you are buying jeans. The smart AI recommendations can show you tops, or bags, or shoes that go well with the jeans. Maybe initially you were buying only jeans. But now, you end up buying the complete look or maybe one or two things from the suggestion list. Thus, personalized recommendations help eCommerce businesses to drive more sales. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Automated Product Description and Product Tagging</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right product description is crucial for online stores. We can’t touch or feel the products physically while making online purchases. So, we go through the product images and descriptions in detail. And then we decide whether to buy it or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, manually writing the descriptions for thousands of products is not at all a feasible idea. But with AI, it becomes a cakewalk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copying the right product description from the manufacturer&#8217;s website is fine. But AI does more than that. By scouring the Internet, AI finds the most relevant product information. And then combining all these, it prepares the perfect product description that your shoppers look for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of some of the benefits of automated product descriptions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The descriptions include the most demanding details</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generates plenty of product descriptions within a short time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shows dynamic pricing. It helps in maximizing the sales and results in higher revenue growth</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzes the effectiveness of the product description. Also, AI can change it as per the requirements</span></li>
</ul>
<p>How easily consumers can find your products on the internet while searching for a specific query is also crucial for driving your eCommerce business. So, your product discoverability should be top-notch. And AI-enabled catalog management tools can help you in achieving so.</p>
<p>With such AI-enabled tools, businesses now can easily come up with well-defined, accurate, and consistent product tags. This ensures your product catalog is of sheer quality. Also, it enhances the product findability on the internet.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. Warehouse Automation </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, AI is transforming warehouse management as well. AI-enabled robots do not need lunch breaks or smoking breaks! They can work 24/7 without taking breaks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it is not like they do not talk. Yes, they do. But they communicate with the AI-enabled software that manages the warehouse. Whenever a purchase is made, their work starts. AI-powered robots can take the ordered products out of the stock, pack it, and make the order ready to be shipped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might think that I’m talking about something from a science fiction movie. But I’m not. These are now possible by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. It is true that we can’t see it in small medium-sized businesses yet. But it is possible. And maybe in the near future, it will become common. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being an eCommerce retailer, what can you enjoy from it?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower labor cost</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved accuracy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast work</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diminished loss from damaged goods, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">F. Intelligent Email Marketing </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are thinking that email marketing is dead, you are wrong! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true that nowadays, we hardly open an email if it is from an eCommerce site. But it does not mean we are not interested to receive an email about the products. We simply don’t like receiving an email about a product which we are not at all interested in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you need to transform your email marketing strategy. And AI can help you with that. How?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emails can be automatically sent at the right time when recipients may actually read it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than sounding automated, it ensures a more ‘human touch’</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the customer feedback, making real-time changes in the strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the responses, smart and intelligent customer analysis </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending emails only concerning a customer’s real interests, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using AI in your eCommerce business, you can know your customers better. And it helps you in chalking out better plans for email campaigning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the things I’ve mentioned above, here is a list of other perks of leveraging the power of AI in eCommerce.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intelligent searches</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retargeting your potential customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filtering out all the fake reviews</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales forecasting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual search</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intelligent data management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhanced cybersecurity</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What_is_the_future_of_AI_in_the_eCommerce_sector"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. What is the Future of AI in the eCommerce Sector? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI in eCommerce is not a very new thing. From the last couple of years, we’ve seen eCommerce businesses taking interest in it. But, many online stores are still unaware of the benefits they can avail of it.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11697" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11697" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11697 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-banking-and-payment.png" alt="Future of Ai in eCommerce payment and banking" width="960" height="873" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-banking-and-payment.png 960w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-banking-and-payment-300x273.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-in-banking-and-payment-768x698.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11697" class="wp-caption-text">Source: businessinsider.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in the coming years, it is expected that more and more businesses will embrace this futuristic technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, I’ve mentioned automated warehouse management in the above section. This is still not that popular the way it should be. We can expect it to become a mainstream trend in the coming years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When artificial intelligence meets IoT &#8211; it can become a deadly combo! Today, eCommerce sites are rapidly moving towards big data. So, who knows, maybe soon your smart devices would assist the online stores to understand what you might buy from them! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is powerful beyond your imagination. And it comes with huge possibilities and opportunities. We all look forward to what it brings in the coming years. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping Up</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI in eCommerce has set a new standard in this industry. Delivering an amazing shopping experience is the main objective of any eCommerce business. And AI has taken it to a whole new level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A quick and more personalized customer service, retaining customers, devising effective marketing strategy &#8211; AI single-handedly looks after everything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you haven’t integrated AI into your eCommerce store yet, do not waste any more time. </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/about/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get in touch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company that is an expert in designing a brilliant online store for you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">CSS development tool one of the recent humdrum and not just fun, as it used to be. If that has been what you have found in the last little while, then it is a good idea to turn something new and fresh such as Rucksack. A neat and compact package full of goodies makes CSS development easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is both modular and quick as lightning. Rucksack built of PostCSS and come out with many full-fledged features. Designers and developers want to start using tools right out of the box, and in this case, we see that Rucksack will not disappoint us. It is easy to integrate it into their work without any hassle. Developers are going to find plugins that exist for the majority of build tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can integrate this Rucksack CSS development tool manually with npm module or process the CSS right into the command line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some of the features that developers might find interesting. Go through the features pointed by the team of developers at our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank">Web Design Services</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a complete modular tool and lets you turn their features on and off. You can also customize it to your taste. Simply pass on the feature name and a Boolean as soon as you initialize it in your build tool. All features can be set to true by default.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Responsive Typography</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can produce the “automagical” fluid typography thanks to a new, responsive property on the font size. You can get a start is as easy to specify responsive as font size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to exercise some control over the font size and you can change the default settings. The most efficient way is to achieve through new shorthand syntax in the font size as well as a new property called font range. The font range is able to identify the viewport width between the font size is fluid. Well, out of this range, the font size can be set against the minimum and maximum values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, it is possible to assign specific values like px, rem, and em with independent properties. Rucksack responsive typography output complicated calc- and VW-based font sizes. Along with the media queries, you can establish a range between font sizes that is fluid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shorthand Positioning</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the use of Rucksack, you will get along with shorthand methods to utilize it by properties such as padding and margin to position your offsets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Quantity Pseudo-Selectors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this CSS development tool that will add pseudo-selectors to allow you to pick and style elements as per their quantity. You can utilize them to create powerful, responsive and content-driven designs –</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. :at-least applies if there’s a specific number of items or more<br />
2. :at-most applies if there are a specific number of items or less<br />
3. :between applies to all items inside a specific range<br />
4. :exactly applies if there’s an exact number of items</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These quantity pseudo-selectors helps to style elements based on the sibling count.<br />
Property Aliases</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rucksack will allow you to set aliases for long property names and save excessive keystrokes. You just need to add it to the @alias rule in the format (alias): (property);. Well, you can utilize the aliases anywhere including other properties. It is better to have a single @alias rule in a project and specify all aliases in a place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Input Pseudo-Elements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rucksacks&#8217; pseudo-elements let you style efficiently the inner elements of HTML5 inputs across browsers. The range input (and the:: placeholder when you enable automatic vendor prefixing) is the only element to support. Yet you can add the extra when browser vendor allows access to their UPIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can style the placeholders with the use of the:: placeholder pseudo-element. You can apply this to any input element or at the style sheet’s roof for global styling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will find the range input difficult to style, so you can enable the use of:: track and:: thumb. You can apply these to any range of elements or at the style sheet’s root for global styling. You will come across the following declarations—WebKit appearance: none; and Moz-appearance: none. You can add relevant elements allowing the custom styles to apply correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Native Clearfix</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rucksack enables the common clear fix methods into native methods within the clear property. It defines itself as the method by which developers make a parent element self-clear so that floats remain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here you will find new two new methods to add &#8211; fix and fix legacy. You will get the same result, yet possess different degrees of browser support. You need to fix the output of the cleaner code that you will require for IE8.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Font src Expansion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rucksack offers a shortcut method to produce some of the bulletproof src set in @font-face. It includes a new font path and you need to set the path simply to the font files. This will create an src-set output based on the FontSpring syntax.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hex RGBA Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This CSS development tool offers a simple shortcut to add an alpha channel to a hex color. You need to add the hex value to convert it as a substitute to the RGB value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Easings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will find a slew of modern easing functions present on Rucksack. Designers and developers can use them both in CSS transitions and animations. Any number of new easing will allow us to translate to cubic-bezier () functions on output. You can natively comprehend it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Legacy Fallbacks</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Legacy support on Rucksack because of their easy provision of fallback comes with many properties on an older browser. You can use voluntary add-on that you can toggle on and off fallbacks. Opacity is also able to generate a suitable MS filter to accomplish transparency in IE8. RGBA is able to produce a hexadecimal fallback rgba () for</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automatic Prefixing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The developers can easily run the code through the suitable Autoprefixer, which automatically applies to a relevant vendor or you can run them as per current browser popularity and support.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to know more about how our developers are using it effectively, you need to look at <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/portfolio/" target="_blank">our recent works.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is 2015, and after a short gap from coding, we are back again. We have assembled our desk to start CODING once more.</p>
<p>The last year was fun, as PHP gained many reputations, but being an insecure language never was one of them. The core team does not withstand all the faults and is rather pouncing on the security matters while updating PHPs latest version. This is because the end users tend to mess up. We have a number of faults within ourselves, we do not update, use outdated packages or packages that have holes in them, we at times also use pre-historic extensions and thus we expose ourselves to a number of threats in a creative manner.</p>
<p>Keeping away a number of glitches let us a start afresh in 2015. As per our PHP developers at UIPL and consulting with them, we have designed the most reliable resource, best practice and PHP tips to avoid those silly mistakes that made PHP developers show the dunk last year.<br />
Let us look into the best practices of PHP development in 2015 to perk up our coding skills &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Use Updated Version Of PHP</b>: While asking our PHP developers on what should be our main PHP tip for our readers the development team marked our team to focus on the use of updated version of PHP for all. People are lazy and speaking of upgrading different application makes them rile up. Most of them ask for legacy support without considering the damage they does to the ecosystem. Even we have seen that the surveys taken on installation percentages of old PHP versions across the web, comparing to the stability list to find how many servers are running PHP and that too in an insecure manner.If you are develop something and run anything else without using the latest version of PHP. Or if you clients insists on the use of the old version instead of the latest tech them about the vulnerabilities they are introducing to their project. Even warn them about the horrors that can happen if they do not act before. Updating your PHP is a task that you cannot do later, do it now and do it often.</li>
<li><b>Avoid the Use of Outdated Hosts</b>: Our developers came across different discussion forum and they feel that developers must refer current PHP versions supported by various hosts. Even they also say that they can find it at phpversions.info or if you would like to contribute and add some missing values on Github. Our developers recommend steering clear the shared hosting in general. According to them today we have a number of cheap VPS providers. When people opt for VPS providers, other than saving you from sharing an environment with everyone else or being susceptible to the instability of a system as introduced by someone. Setting up your own server from scratch is rewarding. Besides, you can see that today barely anyone has the latest version of PHP as the default. Why will you work when you have access to the latest software?</li>
<li><b>Its Time to Adopt HTTPs</b>: Do you know encryption is the crazy fact that you need to have while working on PHP? Just not, as a means to defend you from the snoop of authorization, but also assure that, the clients and website visitors are protected and they will not leak any personal data. Well, you will not find any workarounds to get HTTPs everywhere, one should not rely on those, and it is the responsibility of the web developers to improve the web at large. HTTPs is not directly related to PHP, but while you start a new PHP project it is generally easy to set up your server to use HTTPs before you start coding that too in the middle of the project. To get out of this is cryptic and a discouraging task.</li>
<li><b>Make Sure Your PHP Is Secure</b>: You must follow the best practices when it comes to password protection, password generation, encryption, and authentication. You must read the books and must use packages like those suggested while securing PHP site.</li>
<li><b>You Must Stay on the Right Way</b>: Using the PHP in the right way help to improve the project using PHP codes and you must be responsible for their use. As a plausible resource, you can find both book and digital forms called PTRW that acts as an indispensable resource to make sure that you are fit to handle the challenges of modern app development. Our developers feel that if the coding misses something or if the developers want to contribute with typo corrections or alternative resources and guides, then developers can feel free to do so with the help of <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>.</li>
<li><b>Must Avoid the Bad Packages</b>: Two years ago, Fabien Potencier of <a href="https://symfony.com/" target="_blank">Symfony</a> fame announced the creation of a list of vulnerable packages for PHP and within a couple of years; it turned into an open source public domain property. Not it allows developers’ to post their composer.lock file to their API or web interface and even the CLI tool and helps to check the project for vulnerabilities. However, it is still important as a step from the end users.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, you know we are lazy, quite lazy people.<br />
Well, our developers will like to share one more thing. They feel that the developers must download a security-advisories package that uses this database of known vulnerabilities. Such packages serve as a meta-package that helps to check whether the bad versions are required in your project. It would warn you and prevent the attempt the download of such packages, saving will help not only a checking the steps, but will also delete them gradually.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-php-developers/">Developers who are working on PHP development</a> must include such packages in their projects. You must jointly attach the common vector of insecurity. Thus, this will help the developers to move one-step closer and eradicate security holes on a larger scale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Technology needs an upturn or an upgrade, but with that comes a peculiar feeling “anything that can be done has been done.”As soon as a technology loses its shine and popularity, our interest wanes off and the attention shifts towards the next big thing.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Something similar happened with CSS; it was a revolution in its first launch and over the time, it helped designers to create flexible, tight-crafted and have some beautiful web page layouts. With time, various suggestions came up and said that CSS has worn out perhaps the sun has set.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Well, old should not always find its way to scrap&#8230; so we thought to breathe in new life to CSS for fellow developers. We prefer to highlight some cutting-edge features that you might not have explored.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Here is a revision, a recap, to open up new CSS opportunities for the designers of today!<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>1. Used Images Must Match Site&#8217;s Color Scheme<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Color schemes of conferences along with many speakers, makes it complex to manage the workflow. Manually applying filters does not scale or relies on the access to specific actions such as Photoshop. You might use high resolution such as greyscale PNG and add up tones using <strong>CSS filters</strong>. This application can match the portraits to the event&#8217;s scheme, and you can reuse the images across multiple themes. Just need a CSS rule for each approach.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>2. Use Transforms to Animate Polyhedra<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">CSS polygons, generally created with borders, but we ignore a more powerful tool compared to CSS polygons- the <strong>transform</strong> property. Applying transforms in the nested elements allows us to create complex polygons with image backgrounds or borders and transparent interiors. Using 3D transforms, we can combine 2D shapes into polyhedra and make the object merge, unfold, explode or recombine like WebGL.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>3. Mastering the Use of Calc ()<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Calc()</strong> is a wonderful application in CSS, useful to tame margins, padding or dimensions. It breathes in new life to designs looking for positioning or sizing backgrounds, inside gradients or transforms, not only brings a change to same old units, but also those new viewports.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>4. Sane Use of Box-Sizing<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Restore your sanity, with the proper use of <strong>box sizing</strong>. Without it, you cannot manage an element of defined width after you use padding to increase or decrease its width that makes pixels and percentage tough. With box sizing: border-box, borders and padding is easy to place within a defined width.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>5. Take <strong>Hyphenation</strong> under Your Control<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In print, <strong>hyphenation</strong> is taken for grant, and some designers use property available online, as few are aware of other features that provides a fine control over hyphenation. If designers are not careful, hyphenation ladders come up in different sections and the hyphen&#8217;s reign across multiple lines. The general rule of thumb says not to use hyphens more than two in a row. Use of hyphenate-limit-lines and hyphenate-limit-chars can specify the minimum length of the word that will be hyphenated, along with a minimum number of characters before and after the hyphen pause.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>6. Look into the Available Writing Modes<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Writing modes helps designers to define the direction in which the text should flow. Some of the East Asian scripts written vertically from right to left, so specified with a writing mode &#8211; <strong>vertical-rl (tb-rl in IE)</strong>. Vertical text is of no use in European writing. Instead, devs can use it as table headings if the pages have limited horizontal space.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>7. Unusual Ways to use Gradients<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Background gradients at times can look great if you merge them with definite borders and bullets. With the use of preprocessor, you can mix the reused code, so as not to repeat it manually. Do not go crazy over it, since gradients can be heavy for the processors.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>8. Make Use of String Matching on Links<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Designers can take the advantage of string-matching to style the social icons. To match the right link with the correct style icon use a string-match on the href attribute of the anchor element. Use <strong>*= so</strong> the <strong>href</strong> anchor of the element that contains only a string that users specify.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>9. SVG for the Backgrounds<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">IE 8 and Android 2 WebKit are the only browsers without <strong>SVG</strong> support, so using SVG for the backgrounds in CSS is feasible, especially along with a PNG fallback solution like Grunticon. CSS can style <strong>SVG</strong>, and you can have an interesting bleed-through of CSS filters from SVG that you can play with HTML.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>10. Use &#8216;:target&#8217; in Page Elements<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">CSS is not a programming language originally, but you can do many things on it without referring back to JavaScript. Take the example of <strong>&#8216;:target,&#8217;</strong> a pseudo-class applied to elements that are targets of the clicked link. Yes, you can use this to define the state of a page, target a parent containing lot of elements and your links become the means to control look and layout of all children at a single click.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Phew!! We did it. Freshened your thoughts and renewed your view on CSS. Hope, now you can see some new possibilities in web development and design with CSS. We expect that before pushing the CSS to scrapyard you will like to test these techniques.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/" target="_blank">Unified</a> always have a different way to look at the web designing world, this small initiatives taken by us can surely help developers to have a unique exposure in the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the newest trend for on-demand service apps? Of course the Uber for X model.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This specific model, based on the business model of popular cab service app Uber, is now the ruling trend among the </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">service app maker</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The popularity of this makes it kind of obvious that even the grocery delivery apps are going to follow this trend.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you may be just a normal Joe who wants to make an app or an experienced grocery app developer who wants a piece of this Uber for X ‘cake’ for their business. In any case, if you are wondering how to build a grocery app, then you are in the right place.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we dive deep into the grocery store app development and what it requires, take a detailed look into the Uber For X concept and what it means.  </span></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber For X Concept in Grocery: What Does It Mean?</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The on-demand app sector is being driven by this Uber For X concept, including grocery store apps. But what does this Uber For X even mean?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s simple really. The X in ‘Uber For X’ stands for any service the user requires. So, an Uber for X app is like Uber for cabs.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you book a cab on uber, you get your ride almost instantly, or within a set time. Just like that, and Uber for X app provides the customer the service they require, almost instantly, or within a set time limit.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups are using the Uber For X model to provide their users for various services such as </span><a href="https://www.doctorondemand.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctor on demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>Foodnow<span style="font-weight: 400;">, etc. Grocery delivery apps are also under this business model.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But is it just instantness of it all that’s making the grocery apps so popular? What other reasons are there for their popularity? Let&#8217;s have a look.</span></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Are Grocery App so Popular Among Millennial and Baby Boomers?</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it- grocery apps are life savers. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one likes going grocery shopping. It’s tedious and boring and you’ll always forget at least one item on the list. And for people who are the busy bees, it’s a literal nightmare. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, before we tell you all about how to make your own grocery app, we are going to give you some detailed reasons for their popularity-</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saving Your Time</span></h3>

</ol>

<p>Let&#8217;s explore them in details.</p>



<h2 id="step1">1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Types Of Grocery Apps &#8211; What Business Model You Should Go For</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are thinking about how to create a grocery app, you must know that there are four different kinds of apps. And these are-</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketplaces</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketplace apps have their own menus and delivery drivers to take orders and deliver the grocery to the doorstep. In case you don’t have a prior grocery related business but want to pursue a grocery app, then this is the most suitable type of app for you.</span> The Bigbasket online grocery shopping app is one such example which is popular in India.</p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregators</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregators list all the nearby stores and their menus. This kind of app lets the user order form these listed stores. They use affiliate drivers to deliver the products but the fulfillment of the product depends on the store.</span> one such example is Instacart, popular in US and Flipkart grocery app which is running successfully in India.</p>

</div>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grocery Chains</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big grocery store apps like Wal-Mart and The Kroger Mobile App have their own apps for their customers. With these apps, the consumers can easily order their groceries and have it delivered to their home. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single Stores</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Created by the single stores, these apps are specially for the regular customers of the store. The app building and management, taking orders and delivering them, everything is handled by the single store. This way they can get more business their way.  </span></p>



<h2 id="step2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Three Ends Of Grocery Apps- Buyers, Sellers And Driver’s</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t just create one grocery app and be done with it. When it comes to on-demand grocery app development, there are three sides to the app. </span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="534" class="wp-image-9366" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-app-model-1-1024x534.jpg" alt="how to build a grocery app" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-app-model-1-1024x534.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-app-model-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-app-model-1-768x400.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-app-model-1.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customer app</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administrator app</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the delivery person’s app. </span></li>
</ul>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What features are needed for these specific apps? Let&#8217;s see.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Customer App</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the app for the user. This version is going to be hosted on the app store for downloading and installing. The customer app needs to be full of excellent features and needs to have an amazing UI/UX design and layout.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-9340 size-full">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="333" class="wp-image-9340" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Instacart-detailed-screen-1.png" alt="how to build instacart like app screens" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Instacart-detailed-screen-1.png 800w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Instacart-detailed-screen-1-300x125.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Instacart-detailed-screen-1-768x320.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

</figure>
</div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before you start asking How to build a grocery app for the customers, there are some other features that the customer app needs are-</span></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user should be able to sign up and set their own profile. Add the log in via social media option to make signing up easier.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the customer app, the user must be able to choose from which store they want to order from. List out all the stores your app is affiliated with. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the location feature, the users can input complete address and their location to get the doorstep delivery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search and filter are going to help the customer to search for a specific product and filter out the product they do not want to see.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easily add the chosen product from the list to the cart.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they are done choosing, they can move on to their cart section, checking out the total price of the products and moving on to the checkout.</span></li>
</ul>



<h3>Making Payment Seamless</h3>



<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add a few different kinds of payment option for the customers to choose from. They can pay with card, or PayPal, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wallet is optional but a neat feature anyways. The customer can check out their wallet balance and recharge it if necessary.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of faulty products, the customer should have a return and refund option.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users should be able to schedule their order according to their schedule. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real-time order tracking and to see it’s progress is a feature the users love. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A list to see all the previous orders and their delivery details. </span></li>
</ul>



<h3>Engaging User with Deals and Offers</h3>



<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users should be able to provide ratings and reviews for not only the products but also for the delivery people. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature to add products to the wishlist for future preferences. The customers can be reminded to buy the products placed on the wishlist.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the chat message feature, they can contact the delivery person for any queries. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push notifications for delivery notification, promotional offers, etc will keep the consumer in the loop. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various offers are going to make your customers more prone to shopping from your platform. </span></li>
</ul>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Admin Side Of The App</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The admin app or admin panel is the side of the app that is controlled by the administrator of the delivery app. This is the side that needs to be built with utmost importance because if something goes wrong on the admin side of the service, the customers won’t get their deliveries. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The features you need to include in the admin app are-</span></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing orders: the admin should be able to view detailed order list and notify relevant stores about them. </span></li>

<h2 id="step3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Consider The Important Factors</span> and Design Your App</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the on demand grocery app development process starts, you need to consider some important factors. This will make it easier for you to plan your app and market it to the user. Along with that, doing this will make sure that your app stays more unique than your competitors. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Addressing The Pain Points Of The Customer</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like with the development of any other app, you need to understand and address the pain points of your user. Before you ask how to develop your grocery app, you need to ask why everyone is using grocery apps? </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the app offering them that the store can not?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you understand why apps are more preferred by the user, you need to make it better. Plan and figure out how you can make their shopping experience even better? By doing this you are not only going to give your users a better experience but set yourself ahead of your competition. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Analyzing The Strength And Weaknesses Of The Competitors</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No app is unique today. Which is why you need to consider your competitors before you even begin the planning phase. </span></p>

</div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Install and use the competitor&#8217;s apps for a while and see what they are doing right, and what they are doing wrong. What are the best features of their apps? And what is the worst? Why people like their app, or hate it? Once you have the answer to all these questions, you’ll know you are ready to start planning your app. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Attractive UI/UX Design And Layout</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Attractive UI/UX design goes a long way when it comes to on demand grocery app development.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1650" height="860" class="wp-image-9361" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-screen-1-1.jpg" alt="how to build a grocery app with best UI UX" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-screen-1-1.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-screen-1-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-screen-1-1-768x400.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Grocery-screen-1-1-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></figure>
</div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have finally started on your grocery store app development, you have to make sure that your app has a good UI/UX design and layout. The more attractive it is, the more enjoyable it’ll be for the user to use it. And the more they enjoy using the app, the more people would start using your app.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because you are selling vegetables doesn’t mean you don’t need a good layout for your app. A beautiful layout is absolutely necessary to keep the users stuck to your app. Talk with an experienced <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/" target="_blank">UI UX design agency</a> to manifest your grocery app idea.</span></p>

</div>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Personalized Experience To The Users</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One size fits all” sounds only good as an expression. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to grocery store app development, personalizing your app to the user is kind of a big deal. This is going to give them a feeling that the app owner, which is you, really cares about their needs and wants as shoppers. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how can you personalize their experience? Simple, you can use machine learning to make sure that the app learns about their shopping preferences the more they use the app. You can offer them special deals based on the products they frequently buy.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suggest them products they frequently buy. You can also give them a favorite feature where they can add their liked products for quick access. Personalizing the app according to the user’s need is only going to make them more loyal users. </span></p>



<h2 id="step4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Necessary Grocery App Features To Implement</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are hiring grocery app developers should know that every grocery store app needs some necessary plus customized features. These features are supposed to make shopping easier for users. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are these features?</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating A Shopping List</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many times has it been that you’ve gone shopping, but forgot what to buy cause you didn&#8217;t write a shopping list?</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1650" height="860" class="wp-image-9367" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-list-of-items-1.jpg" alt="how to build a grocery app with shopping list" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-list-of-items-1.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-list-of-items-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-list-of-items-1-768x400.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-list-of-items-1-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></figure>
</div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too many times. Same goes with online shopping. There is a good enough chance that you might forget to add one or two items on the cart. Which is why you need a shopping list feature. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this, the app user can create a shopping list of all the things they need and search accordingly. Bonus points to your app if they can just directly share their shopping list with the vendor through the app placing their order simply. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick And Easy Search</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to search for an item in a store, isn’t it?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why people moved to online grocery apps so swiftly. It’s an awful waste of time wandering through the aisles looking for your favorite kinds of cookies. On the grocery apps, however, it’s awfully easy. All you gotta do is to search for it.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1650" height="860" class="wp-image-9368" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-search-items-1.jpg" alt="how to build a grocery app search option" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-search-items-1.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-search-items-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-search-items-1-768x400.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-search-items-1-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></figure>
</div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if it’s not easy to search and find products on your app, then there is really no point in using it. Customers need to be able to find their products easily on your app. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that all the products are categorized well on your app. With a proper category, you can make it easy for the user to find their products. It’s not going to work if they find eggs under the vegetable category. So use the categorization feature well. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add To Cart</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an obvious feature in all and any shopping app. The Cart.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is symbolic of shopping for stuff. So it is no wonder that &#8216;add to cart&#8217; is a feature that you need. Allow the users to add things in their cart. They might buy it right then, or maybe later. But once they add it to the cart, they won’t forget to buy it. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular And Favorite Items</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add the suggestion section where you can show the user popular and their favorite items based on their recent purchases. With this section, you can help the users to access the products easily.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1650" height="860" class="wp-image-9369" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-add-to-cart-1.jpg" alt="how to build a grocery app add to cart" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-add-to-cart-1.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-add-to-cart-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-add-to-cart-1-768x400.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feature-Grocery-add-to-cart-1-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></figure>
</div>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special Deals, Offers, And Rewards</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether a shopper or online grocery app developers, you should know that giving the users special deals and offers on their frequently purchased product is a feature that’ll have a positive effect on your app. With such deals, you can make sure that the users return to your app for buying their groceries again and again. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push Notifications</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To let the users know about the deals and offers going on in your app you need the feature of push notifications. Not only for offers and deals though, but the users can also set up reminders to buy certain items or to notify them when a certain item is on sale. Push notifications can go a long way to make your app become the new favorite to the users.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Order Tracking And Status</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the order has been placed, let the user track its progress and status. With this feature, they would be able to track the progress of their orders and see how long it will take for it to get to them.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure Multiple Payment Options</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When going through grocery shopping app development it is important that you have multiple options for payments in your app. With the ability to pay directly from their phones, users are going to have a better shopping experience. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also add different payment methods like Paypal, PayU, Quickpay, etc. by adding these payment methods. Adding these methods is going to make it more convenient for the users to shop from your app.  </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scheduled Delivery Times</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t stay at home all the time just cause there is a delivery pending from a grocery store app. Which is why it is better to integrate the scheduled delivery times feature into your app. With this, the user can schedule the delivery time for their groceries. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can have the groceries delivered to their doorstep at a convenient time for them. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ratings And Reviews</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this feature, consumers can leave ratings and reviews on different products and shops from where they ordered the product. They can also give reviews to personal shopper or deliveryman. This will help them pick only the best for them. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutritional Value Of What You Are Offering</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the health conscious this is a neat feature. They can check out the nutritional value of the food items they are ordering. You can also add a quick suggestion feature based on the specific diet they must be following. This feature will bring more health conscious crowd to your app.  </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan A Meal Order The Ingredients</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning a meal and cooking can become easy with this feature. The users can plan a meal upload it on the app, and the app can simply list all the ingredients required to make that meal. This feature is extremely handy for those who love to cook but barely have enough time to go for shopping. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency Delivery Of Products</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when you are making a dish, and have forgotten to buy one ingredient. With the emergency order and delivery feature, you can help the users solve this problem easily. In case of emergency, the user can order something to be delivered quickly, from the closest source available. This can be a life-saving feature for your grocery store app. </span></p>



<h2 id="step5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. How To Monetize Your Grocery Delivery App?</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every app needs to be monetized. Because after all, everyone needs an ROI on their app. But the monetization strategies change along with the kind of app you are building. When it comes to grocery delivery apps, many wonder how to use apps like Instacart to make money. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So before you start thinking about how to make your grocery app, make sure to take a look at these monetization ideas.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upcharging The Item</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a grocery delivery app, you can always upcharge the item. It is a usual monetization strategy used by all grocery store delivery apps and you can utilize it for your platform as well.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivery Charges</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The delivery charges are another obvious way for you to monetize your app. Many grocery apps charge their users for delivery. You can, however, offer free delivery to people located near you or if their order exceeds a set amount.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/top-app-monetization-ideas/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" width="981" height="227" class="wp-image-9351" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/app-monetization-ideas-1-1.png" alt="how to build a grocery app and make money" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/app-monetization-ideas-1-1.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/app-monetization-ideas-1-1-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/app-monetization-ideas-1-1-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></figure>
</div>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comision From Orders</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This works well for the aggregator model. You can ask for a small commission from all the store listed on your app for bringing more business to them through your online platform.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premium Advertising Service</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can place special ads for a specific store and get revenue from it. However, if you have a warehouse model; then it won’t work out for you.</span></p>



<h2 id="step6">6. <span style="font-weight: 400;">What Tech Stack You Need To Make Your Grocery Delivery App?</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to know the tech stack first to implement features mentioned above into your app.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what is the tech stack for building your grocery app?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following points, we are going to tell you the technological details you need to know to build a grocery app like Instacart. So gather your pen and paper.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing Your Code And Deploying It</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make a complete app, you need proper codes. And writing these codes and deploying them properly is part of the app development tech stack. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps like Instacart use Github to develop and deploy their codes. It is easy to share, deploy and comment on the code over Github, which is why it is being used by many Uber for X startups to build their first app. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming Languages To Use</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you are developing an app just for android, then the programming language you need to use is Java. for iOS you need Swift. You can also use Ruby on Rails framework to build the front end for the initial iOS version of your app. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a web application, you can use C++ or C#. for the website frontend, you should use, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The backend of the app can be built using PHP or Python. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How To Pay? The Payment Gateway</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to use a safe technology to add a secure payment gateway to your app. The most used technologies by the app developers are Stripe, Braintree, Paypal, etc. to give a seamless payment experience to the user, make sure to implement more than one kind of payment gateway to your app.</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivery Timing: When Will The Grocery Arrive?</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’ll be amazing if you could let your clients know when their productswould be arriving.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with the machine learning algorithm, you can do just that. The algorithm considers all the factor like the delivery location, order volume, dispatch time. With this, the app will give the user an estimated time for the delivery of the groceries. </span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Navigational Support</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need GPS navigation for your delivery app. It is an important feature to have in your app. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the location of the delivery, you can use Core Location Framework for iOS and  Google’s Places API for Android.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the driver tracking and giving them right navigation details, you can use, MapKit for iOS and Google Maps API for Android. </span></p>



<h2 id="step7">7. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost Of Developing A Grocery App</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grocery app development cost in India and the US, depends on many different aspects, such as the platform and the kind of business model you choose to go with. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time frame of the app development process also has a big effect on the app building process. </span></p>

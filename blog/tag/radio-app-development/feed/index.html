<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8753" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pandora-vs-spotify-1.png" alt="how to make a radio app like Pandora or Spotify battle" width="1650" height="860" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pandora-vs-spotify-1.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pandora-vs-spotify-1-300x156.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pandora-vs-spotify-1-768x400.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pandora-vs-spotify-1-1024x534.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you consider </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to make a radio app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Pandora, let’s read out how Pandora is different from its competitors.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Users Can Enjoy On-Demand Music Plan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it&#8217;s true. Pandora being a radio app also doubles up as an on-demand music app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is available through Pandora Premium plan. You can search and play tracks of your choice with this subscription. There is an option to create customizable playlists. And, you can also listen to your favorite music offline. You have higher audio quality and longer timeouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this, in addition to your radio app functionalities.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Recommendations Just According To Your Music Interest</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandora suggests fresh music options for your taste. The app keeps track of your music preferences and suggests songs accordingly. With Spotify, you do not have this advantage. You listen to popular artists only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandora offers personalization of music preferences along with room for fresh music.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Spotify is a tough contender in the music app segment, it is Pandora that stands out with its offerings.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excited To Create A Radio Station App? Let Me Tell You The Factors You Should Consider First! </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you know why Pandora holds a strong position in the market. With this, it is important to understand the elements for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">radio app station development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before you jump into the bandwagon, it is important to consider certain factors.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Do You Have Proper Licensing and Permissions?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an important element to your radio app. In order to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop an app like Pandora</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have to consider music streaming permissions. Getting a music license for your radio app is a costly affair. So, before you start to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create radio app like Pandora</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, shortlist on the music type and regional categories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, music preference is directly linked to geography. So, it is important to understand geography music demands before license purchases. Also, formulate a mechanism to recover the costs.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Which Database Will You Go For Music Streaming?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to play music, you need an effective database. With such a vast amount of data, it is better to use a cloud-based storage and sourcing solution. It reduces the unwanted cost of hardware purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another vital factor in this is the use of advanced search and streaming tools. AWS can be used for this functionality.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Is You Radio App’s UI UX Design Better Than the Others?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will the user see first in your radio app?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not music, but the app itself. Hence, it is essential to understand the outlook of a music app. You need to design your radio app accordingly. This will help you drive the user interests and engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of new elements are being added to mobile design rapidly. You need professional app designing assistance to ace in the game.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Recommendation Engine you Need To Create a Radio Mobile App</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to make a radio app </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Pandora? Get a first-class recommendation algorithm. As said earlier, music recommendation is the USP for Pandora. You can get a competitive edge with this feature as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of recommendation algorithms that you can use. One is collaborative filtering and the other one is the content-based algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of a collaborative filtering algorithm, the suggestions are based on user ratings. So, the radio app suggests tracks popular among a larger segment. The content-based algorithm, on the other hand, suggests music based on what you liked in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But is Pandora earning enough? Let’s find out.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does Pandora like radio app make Money?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue is what you need the most from your radio app. Hence, you need an effective monetization model to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop an app like Pandora</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are two ways by which Pandora generates revenue.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earnings from Ad-Supported Free Service</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the basic subscription for Pandora users. You do not pay anything to listen to radio station music. But, you get ads played in between. There is an option to like or dislike a track with “Thumbs Up” or Thumbs Down”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a song is disliked, it never plays back again for the user.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid Subscriptions For Premium Service</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two paid subscription plans for Pandora.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandora Plus is the ad-free subscription with a listening permit of 4 radio stations offline. You can replay tracks and receive better audio quality. There is a longer timeout period with this subscription.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandora Premium is the ultimate plan wherein you enjoy radio and on-demand streaming both. You get customizable playlists and offline music along with other benefits of Pandora Plus plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is another plan for family members as well. It offers all the benefits of Pandora Premium subscription to 6 users simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait! There is more. You earn from your radio app through some other ways as well. Just read on!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Ways to Earn Money if You Create a Radio Station App like Pandora</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid subscriptions and adverts are the conventional revenue generation models put to use by Pandora. But you can get creative in this segment as well. Let’s show you some other ways with which your radio app can generate profits.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising Remodeled</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, so you are already playing ads in between songs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But do you know you can put adverts on your app screen as well? You can intelligently place ads on a specific section of a screen which is visible to the listener. This way you get to run ads without interrupting the music. If the listener feels like, he can click on the ad.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show the Freemium users What They are Missing Out</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You already provide the best features and music to the Premium users. But do the freemium users know about it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are they aware of the incredible benefits they are missing out on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can do that while playing a song or looking for a piece of music. Suppose, a listener is looking for a particular song. Your app shows the song. But as he tries to play it, drop in a voice saying “If you want to listen to this number, just subscribe”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These prompts work very effectively towards increasing subscription counts or user base.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try it and you won’t regret!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Break it Down with In-App Purchases</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, buying a whole plan might pinch your users. So, you can break it down for them. You can offer certain flash offers for them. Like, access to the music from a certain genre at a discount price. Or access to music from a specific artist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way you keep your listeners happy while earning from unconventional subscription offerings. And who knows, they might end up being Premium users in some time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not only about “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to make a radio app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, but also about “how to earn from it”.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering with Advertisers for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incentivized Advertising</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a great way to earn from your radio app. You can join forces with certain advertisers. They offer rewards to your listeners when they perform certain actions. It can be an in-app purchase for listening to a track maybe.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try Considering Affiliate Marketing</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s break it down for you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brand approaches you with an ad banner proposal for its app. Your radio app features the brand while playing music. Your listeners get interested in the app and click on the download option flashing in your app screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And voila! You get paid for the installation or the download.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interesting right? You can consult your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">radio app developer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regarding the proper implementation of this feature.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Look for a Diverse Portfolio</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look into the developer’s work profile. If you consider deploying a development team, then ask if they have worked on similar projects before. If so, so you can discuss </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to make a radio app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more user-centric and business viable at the same time&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since they have already worked on such an app project, they will know what is hot in the market. You can even add a feature that is unique. This makes a significant difference to your radio app.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Experience &#8211; Those Work Years Count</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, that&#8217;s right. Those years of experience are a big advantage to you.

They have a few tricks up their sleeves which can be a booster to your app.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Do they have a Design Team?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will be the first look for your radio app?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, its the look and feel. If you want your audience hooked onto the app, you need a super design. One that has a catchy appearance with easy navigation and search/play option. That is possible if there is an experienced and expert design team at the disposal.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. What are Others Saying?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for reviews and testimonials by other people and companies for whom the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">radio app developer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has worked for. This will give you a fair idea about their work culture and delivery potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also get in touch with some people who can provide valuable information regarding the developer team.</span></p>

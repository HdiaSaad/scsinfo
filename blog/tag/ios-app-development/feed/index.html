										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Apple has always taken the concept of design to another level higher, each time it has come out either with an upgraded operating system or a new device. Creating unique user experiences by offering them appealing designs has always been one of the key goals of this American multinational technology company. It’s the high quality design of the product that makes Apple a favourite gadget among people. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Companies that have been involved in iOS app development have to follow strict guidelines as far as UI/UX design is concerned. We have researched about the different rules that need to be followed while designing an iOS app and have concluded 6 tips that would help you to design the user interface of an iOS app quickly. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Tip 1: Manage Content With Proper Layouts and Visuals</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While working with the content, use larger items. It helps users to focus more and not get distracted by surroundings. Alignments make an app look organized and at the same time help user to scroll easily through the important information on a screen, which is full of clustered content. Moreover, every interactive element should have proper spacing to make it easier for people to interact. Hence, interactive visuals and layouts are one of the keys for a great UI/UX design in </span><a title="iOS 8 App Development Service" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>iOS app development</b></span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Tip 2: Use</b></span> <span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Interactive UI elements For Easy Touch Controls </b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Interactive elements bring life to an app, so why not use it? Be it the color, location or icons, introducing interactivity will pique the interest of the users. For instance: using blue color in the app adds a unique appeal to an icon. A location map app with a blue icon for ‘Directions from here’ acts as a call-to-action button. On the other hand, app store makes use of button border in order to help the user make a clear distinction between purchasing the product and reading more about the same. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Tip 3: Legitimate Text Size For Clear View</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A great typography is one of the keys for a <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/" target="_blank">great UI/UX design</a>. If you are working with iOS 9 or later versions, then use ‘San Francisco’ font. It will give your readers a dynamic view of the text by providing wonderful reading experience. Other benefits of using this font are auto adjustments in letter spacing, specify different kinds of text styles and the availability of wide range of font sizes. You can download the San Francisco font from here.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Tip 4: Use High Resolution Pictures </b></span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Tip 5: Organize the Layout With Proper UI Kit</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The iOS UI kit offers four UI elements – Bars, content views, temporary views and controls. A UI view is well equipped with controls and control views. It can determine when to draw onscreen and can easily detect the touch points of the user. Use the view controller in order to co-ordinate the displays of the number of views and create the functionality behind user interaction. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Tip 6: Align Properly With The Text And Images </b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Consider the visual elements intelligently and then align them with the content. For instance: use of drop shadows and gradients can sometimes become heavier and interfere with the content. In order to overcome this problem, you should take care of the content instead and let UI take a backseat. Use negative spaces in order to make the app look more distinctive.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">Step – 4: Turn the services which you want to activate either with your iPhone or iPad</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Benefits of iCloud</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">In the beginning of this article, we gave you a glimpse of the various benefits, which you can avail once you have an iCloud account. Now, we will give you a macro view of its various benefits.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: large;"> Earlier, it was really difficult to keep all the iTunes music as well as TV series in your Apple gadgets, as space always posed as a problem but now with the arrival of iCloud, you can easily download music from iTunes or TV shows and at the same time can also store them.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;"> Whenever you choose iCloud, you get a free me.com email id. This helps to synchronize your email, calendar, and contacts very easily. It does not matter whether you have an existing email id or not. With iCloud you can keep all your data safe and secure.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;"> Streaming photos now becomes easier. How? Now, you do not have to transfer the photos which you have taken through your DSLR to your Mac anymore as all the photos get streamed in your iCloud and you can view them anytime you like.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;"> You can connect with your friends easily. Not only this, there are a number of options that are available such as sharing your location with your friend, searching for someone in an unknown destination and many more.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large;"> For book lovers, here’s the good news. Now, you can bookmark the last read page of your book. With the help of iBook, you can track the progress of your book; something similar to that of Kindle.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><i><b>Beware!</b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">Over the last few months, many phishing emails have flooded the inbox of thousands of Apple users asking them to disclose their iCloud login. It is better to be aware of such mails and not to fall under the trap of a third party who can have access to all your personal information stored in iCloud with the help of Cryptolocker, a type of software that unlocks your accounts and encrypts all the files.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">Well, in order to prevent yourself from falling under any such trap it is advisable that you do not click on the links of any mail that was sent to you from Apple. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><i><b>WWDC 2016 Conference And Many More …</b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">There are lots of hopes and expectations from WWDIC, 2016 (Apple Worldwide Developer’s Conference) which is to be held from June 13-17. The conference is mainly targeted at developers and all the iPhone users. This conference is going to throw light on increasing the awareness in strengthening the iCloud security. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">Apart from that, there are a number of things, which we can expect from the conference. Let us have a look at all of them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>A New Macbook Pro</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">We haven’t seen any new version of MacBook coming up since 2012. The Conference might announce the arrival of the latest version of Macbook. It is rumored that the new one could include some additional features such as USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3 ports.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>An All New Apple Pay</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">Apple Pay is expected to undergo some new modifications. One can now gather more loyalty points now and get help for withdrawing money from the ATM.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Apple TV In A New Avtar</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">If the rumors are to be believed, then Apple TV is working on a streaming service in order to take over Netflix. It could also open up more gaming options to developers as far as improvements are concerned. As of now, in order to play the Apple games, one needs to have a Siri remote, but a more improved version of the Apple TV could just be the simple use of control pads. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">iCloud will prove to be beneficial for the coming tech-savvy generation that lives and breathes social media and technology. With so many pictures clicked in one single day and so many documents to take care of, nothing could be a better option other than iCloud for Apple users.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">For an interesting update on iCloud keep coming here. We are as excited as you are about technology and always keep an eagle’s eye over any development taking place. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In this digital age of the 21</span><sup><span style="font-size: medium;">st</span></sup><span style="font-size: medium;"> era, developing a web application is more than something than the word ‘modern’ itself. Open source web applications came into the fore in order to facilitate the task of a programmer when it came to modifying the source code of an application. But over the years, with the emergence of more sophisticated technologies, this kind of application has undergone a futuristic makeover. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>The Power of four…</b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Because that’s what defines </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>M</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Mongo DB) </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>E </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Express)</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> A</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Angular JS)</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> N</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Node JS) &#8211; a single language that has been developed which runs only on JavaScript and helps to build robust web applications. It takes </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/" target='_blank'>web application development</a> </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">to a completely new level. It keeps the application organized and is to date the best readable open-source solution for all projects. From the client, to server to persistence, this innovative approach for developing web applications is taking the technology world in its grip. In fact, if you have never used MEAN in any of your web development project, then it is time to make use of the mean machine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are still thinking about whether to use MEAN stack or not, then relax, we have found a solution to your problem. We present to you some solid reasons for why you should use this in your next web application development project.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Full Cloud Control by MongoDB</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A more secure database is now available in MongoDB that provides maximum protection to the data. The two key USPs of these advance level security layer are cluster support and automatic sharing. As soon as you install MongoDB, it automatically connects with all your servers in order to provide backup support in case of any technical failure. Moreover, automatic replication is yet another important reason why MEAN stack is more reliable. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Flexible MySQL server</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are a developer, who is reading this then you would understand the pain that one has to undergo while defining the complex process of entering data into tables while developing relational databases. But what, if you could have inserted the data smoothly? Well, MongoDB helps you to do exactly the same. All you have to do is, add a field to the form team it with the other data in the JSON document and add this to MongoDB, that’s it.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Easy Navigation Through Node.JS </b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Navigating through multiple configuration files that come with a different syntax is not only confusing but always makes it vulnerable to error, but with MEAN stack, the process becomes much simpler. With the help of JavaScript and Node.Js, you can either rewrite the URLs or can also make an odd mapping. Moreover, you don’t have to write the pages of PHP or Apache anymore. Here, you have the flexibility to get everything in one layer that will leave fewer possibilities of bug generation that often arises due to the presence of multiple layers.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Cheap Disk Space </b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">JOIN is mainly used in order to save the storage area in the hard disk by removing fields like state, city and zip code. This prevents creating any unnecessary tables that in turn creates extra space in the hard disk. On the other side of the coin, the JOINs can take up some extra space in your RAM and might not be a good idea at all. Hence, using MongoDB is a necessity as it creates a lot of extra space in the hard drive. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Programming Becomes Easier</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Coding becomes much easier with MEAN stack. You can make use of it on the client’s side as well. This means if you write a code wrongly on Node and then find out that it would have been better using it in Angular JS, then you can easily shift the code. You also do not need to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-php-developers/" target='_blank'>hire a front-end developer or a PHP expert</a> as JavaScript does this all for you. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Node.JS Is Faster</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The event-driven architecture of NodeJS makes it the hero. In this era, where everything is driven digitally, it is important to understand that even the minute detail of an app’s performance matters to them. With Node.JS, you can double the performance of an app. Hence, it comes as an extra benefit in the MEAN stack package.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>A Great Combination Anytime</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While there are many developers who use MongoDB and Apache and sometimes mix it with PHP. On the other hand, there are developers who use NodeJS with MySQL and Angular JS as well, hence it is never a sin to mix and match. There is no fixed rule to use this combination. One is always free to experiment.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>JSON, a Common Factor</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Whether you make use of MongoDB or AngularJS, you can smoothly distribute the data between the layers without rewriting the code again. It also enables you to make use of PHP. You can use the code here to import all the data from MySQL and process it. One interesting thing is that MEAN uses the same format of JSON everywhere. As a result, much time is saved when it comes to reformatting by making the whole process simpler. The icing on the cake is that it enables you to work even with external APIs such as POST, present GET and manipulate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Final Words…</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Most of the developers think that MEAN will overcome LAMP in the years to come, but there is no guarantee to this fact. It is true that over the years LAMP has provided a plethora of benefits as far as web development is concerned, but the introduction of MEAN has taken the whole process of development to an advanced level due to its various benefits. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The large community of Mean Stack is always there for the developers to assist them in solving the hurdles they encounter while developing an application. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Hence, if you want to accelerate your web application development process MEAN stack should be your first preference. It is the bedrock and the ingredient of success behind the effective execution of a flawless web application. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.Js</strong> is the hottest trend in the tech realm, giving developers a choice of 35,000 modules to browse. Users say Node is too easy to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/" target="_blank">develop a working application</a>, which can balance without trouble. The fan base of Node.Js has started to spread their rhetoric like religion. Let us check out what makes it distinctive.</p>
<p><strong>What is Node.js?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> says, “Node.js is a packaged compilation of Google’s V8 JavaScript engine, the libuv platform abstraction layer, and a core library, which is itself primarily written in JavaScript. Used in server side coding, handling AJAX requests, maintaining routes for different APIs and manipulating database.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How Node.js works?</strong><br />
Ryan Dahl, creator of Node.js was aiming to create real-time websites with push capability, inspired by applications like Gmail. So there he comes with Node.js. In the Node.js, he gave developers a tool for working in the non-blocking, event-driven I/O paradigm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know, in web browsers developers are restricted to use language as they have to provide security to the user. Usually in such cases, all activities aim at DOM-manipulation and asynchronous page info loading.</p>
<p><strong>Here, Node.js opens up opportunity for new perspectives retaining its browser nature. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">1.What in Node.js developers find easy and compatible with their jobs?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">2.What the experts have learned over the year?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">3.What mistakes newbie must avoid?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, with time experts have become aware of various tips and tricks that can benefit both – a newbie and expert. Let us share some of those benefits to help you recap or start fresh.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.js: It is Asynchronous</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A distinguishing feature of Node.js is that it is single-threaded, designed and implemented as asynchronous from top to bottom. More than 60% of the developers have faced problems due to this asynchronous property, but today most of them person knows the solution. When you a run a time-consuming job such as accessing the database, use a counter to keep track of the loop, or else before completing the loop the next function would commence.<br />
Bad luck exists, as it is still possible to make synchronous/blocking calls. Well, many file systems have both asynchronous and synchronous versions, such as writeFile and writeFileSync. Even if you avoid the asynchronous method in your code, it is possible to exist in an external library that has blocking call.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Look here – </strong><br />
<strong>GOOD PRACTICE: Write Files Asynchronously</strong><br />
1| fs.writeFile(&#8216;message.txt&#8217;, &#8216;Hello Node&#8217;, function (err) {<br />
2| console.log(&#8220;It&#8217;s saved and the server remains responsive!&#8221;);<br />
3| });</p>
<p><strong>BAD PRACTICE: Write Files Synchronously</strong><br />
1| fs.writeFileSync(&#8216;message.txt&#8221;Hello Node&#8217;);<br />
2| console.log(&#8220;It&#8217;s saved but you just blocked ALL requests!&#8221;);</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.Js: What’s Callback Hell, How to Handle It</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>What is Callback Hell? &#8211; Excessively nested asynchronous callbacks referred as Callback Hell.</em><br />
It is good to keep nested callbacks to a minimum limit, as it is a simple way to untie your callbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Let us begin with a typical example to explain our point &#8211;</strong><br />
1|function register(name, password, cb){<br />
2| checkIfNameExists(name, function(err, result){<br />
3| if(err){<br />
4| return cb(“error”);<br />
5| }<br />
6| checkIfPasswordGood(password, function(err, result){<br />
7| if(err){<br />
8| return cb(“error”);<br />
9| }<br />
10| createAccount(name,password, function(err,result){<br />
11| if(err){<br />
12| return cb(“error”);<br />
13| }<br />
14| createBlog(name, function(err, result){<br />
15| sendEmail(name, function(err, result){<br />
16| callback(result);<br />
17| });<br />
18| });<br />
19| });<br />
20| });<br />
21| });<br />
22| }<br />
<strong>You would come across certain asynchronous operations that lead to Callback Hell, its &#8211;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chain of Asynchronous Operations:</strong> Get something from API, process it with another API and write the result into database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Asynchronous Set Operations:</strong> Collection of objects, performs asynchronous operation or some other actions when all operations are complete</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>And to prevent callback hell you can browse the great libraries such as:</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Async.js</strong>: Allow easy execution of functions in series without nesting them<br />
<strong>2. Bluebird</strong>: Promises makes asynchronous logic more manageable with mapping and enqueueing<br />
<strong>3. Q</strong>: Reveals the concept of promise just like bluebird to manage the nested calls effortlessly</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.Js: Separate Util and Config File</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Developers must make it a habit of using util.js file for frequently used functions. Try to acquire this file as a variable in your module. This in turn would reduce the number of global variables and code length. Even can config files that stores constant parameters.<br />
Suppose you require an application to show details of top five students, it can vary and become ten students. So do not be hard with your code limits. Keep it in the config file. One best practice is to maintain a ‘Lang’ folder that is useful for a multilingual application.</p>
<p><strong>As for file acquiring aspect, it is simple in Node.js. You can write,</strong><br />
1| var util = require(‘./util.js’),<br />
2|<br />
3| englishMessages = require(‘./lang/en.js’);</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.js: Looking at the Monitor Performance</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ask yourself how you could monitor the application performance and profile, as you need to make sure that the app in running at optimum speed. Well, for that you would get some tools like- Nodefly, New relic, etc<br />
<strong>Nodefly</strong>–A simple line of code that starts to monitor your application to detect memory leaks, or measure how long it takes for redis, to make mongo queries and other stuffs.<br />
<strong>New Relic</strong>–This tool would help developers to monitor response time to server monitoring in your real-time and data-intensive Node.js application.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.Js: Delegate using Granular Modules</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You have to work with many tables in Node.js, so it is necessary to split codes. It is better to make different modules for different tables, and to interact with child modules make a separate parent module.<br />
Well, let us demonstrate an example &#8211; There are different departments in an office database, 4 to 6 project make a department and number of employees makes a department.</p>
<p><strong>Now you can structure this project with four modules – </strong><br />
a. Employees<br />
b. Projects<br />
c. Department and<br />
d. Office</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here <strong>Office</strong> is your parent module and rest three is the child. Function of this module is to pass controller to the proper module. Suppose you tried to update the <strong>Employee</strong> table, for that, you have to update the <strong>Projects</strong> and <strong>Department</strong> as well. Do not try to acquire other modules into student module. It is better to pass on the request to Office module, and it would direct the request to preferred module, this would help you to sort code and review errors easily.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.Js: Debugging is Easy</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you hail from a language with heavy IDE integration like Java or C#, then debugging Node.js seems to be confusing. Most new Node developers prefer to adopt debugging pattern with the use of console.log. However, you would still get some alternatives, conventional to debugging. Node.js comes with a built-in debugger that runs by calling node debug, like <strong>Node Inspector</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node Inspector</strong>&#8211; A debugger interface for node.js using the Blink Developer Tools (earlier WebKit Web Inspector). It allows developer to debug the application using any editor and chrome web tools of their choice. With <strong>Node-Inspector</strong>, developers can do some cool stuff such as live code changing, step debugging, scope injection and other cool aspects. To follow up the aspects find out more at <a href="https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.Js: Be Careful with the New Modules</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You would come across more than 35,000 modules in Node.js, but some of them are dead. With Node.js changing their API repeatedly in their major versions, it is confusing to work. The module works under <strong>v0.8.x</strong> may abort under <strong>v0.10.x</strong>. Therefore, before you sprang on a new module, you should check the PR List to make sure that it is free of bugs or is it under maintenance.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.Js: Node Package Manager is a Marvel</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Node Package Manager is the root of all deployment systems for Node.js, underlying the PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) providers eases out management of library dependencies. Node comes with amazing npm that installs modules specified min your package.json manifest file. Well, in such an instance newbie’s keeps the package.json updated with all modules they use. It painful to open the package and update dependencies property with new modules every time, but npm does this for you!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, it is better to run the npm install, save a module name, and in turn, npm would automatically update the package.json with correct module and version name.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.js: Be Careful About Errors</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For newbie’s, it is important to remember that node can crash easily for a single error. Therefore, it is our suggestion to the newbie and the experts to handle errors properly and throw a proper message against it. Use of try-catch box slows your process, so avoid it.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Node.js: Do Not Forget to Return</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the beginners forget to return after a callback. While sometimes this has no implication at all, but there are times when you run into odd issues because you might get a callback twice.</p>
<p><strong>Let us see an example for it – </strong><br />
1| function do(err,result, callback){<br />
2| if(err){<br />
3| callback(“error”);<br />
4| }<br />
5| callback(“good”);<br />
6| }</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The snippet does make a sense. If you find an “error”, send in the callback, if not send good. However, calling for the callback is not a good way to stop from completing the execution, it would move on to calling callback.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Node.js: Conclusion</strong><br />
Often today, we get down creating real-time applications with the use of Node.js. You must be looking for their future use in certain projects such as APIs or networking projects, for them Node.js is going to prove as a great model of deployment. With their, pre-formatted asynchronous code and use of language that is easy to pick, Node.js is a sheer popular choice.</p>

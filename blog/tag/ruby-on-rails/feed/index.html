										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the time the world is experiencing the era of digital transformation, web development has excelled rapidly and has opened the doors of infinite opportunities. Innovation and technology are taking a rapid leap in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and is entering into new realms. When it comes to web application development, a sea change has taken place in the last few years. These changes have given a new ways on developing a web application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby on Rails has always been the first preference when it comes to developing the website in the best possible manner. UIPL has come out with some interesting benefits of this web application framework that will help developers to design a website page easily.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Just The Right One For Web</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just as water can mix itself anywhere irrespective of the size and shape of the container where it is poured in, in the same way, Ruby on Rails is just the perfect match for your website regardless of the type of business where you are involved in. It’s ability to run on a prototype makes it the ultimate option for using in web development. Moreover, one can also fix any kind of issues at the early stages of development.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><b>Cost Effective For You </b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The framework of Ruby on Rails is completely free. You do not have to incur any additional expenditure at all. Being an open source application, it also runs on Linux. Most of the developers, all around the world find it convenient and easier to work with this type of framework. Even if you have migrated either from Microsoft Windows or from ASP, you won’t face any kind of problems.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><b>Saves A Lot Of Time</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a very well-known fact that coding takes a hell lot of time. The complexity in writing the codes in a way that are user-friendly and easy to understand is not only a cumbersome but also a time-consuming process. Developers can move very fast from the planning stage to the development stage very quickly without wasting much time. Hence, in comparison to the other technologies available, <a title="Ruby on Rails" href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> is much beneficial.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><b>Helpful Community </b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you require any kind of assistance or technical advice while making the application, then you can take help from a vast online community. The community comprises of people who have rich experience in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web application development</a>. In addition to this, there are many groups of developers who remain active all the time and are ready to share their ideas as well as experiences in web and app development.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><b>No Delay In Projects</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most frequent problems faced by app development companies is the unnecessary delay in delivering projects. This is caused by the developer who was working on the project and left working on it due to a job change. As a result of which, it becomes impossible to find the where the code began and how did it end. On the other hand, the code needs to be re-written in a fresh way. In order to avoid such kind of problems, Ruby on Rails has been developed. Here, all that the new developer has to do is just follow some simple coding techniques to get a hang of the project.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><b>Make Your Own Applications</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the stunning benefits of Ruby on Rails is that you can create your own plug and play apps. It’s not a cumbersome task to do at all. You can snap your fingers and make your app. This is as simple as that. One can also take elements from the current application and can implement them in developing the new app. Moreover, Ruby on Rails allows you to add more flexibility and make any necessary modifications to them.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><b>The Tag Of The ‘Big Players’</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Twitter, Basecamp, Groupon, LivingSocial, name any popular website of the world and you will find one thing common in them – Ruby on Rails. The application is trusted by millions of companies around the world, due to its ability to carry out complex functions smoothly and offer a plethora of services. It is just the perfect tool for anybody who is planning to start his or her own business. As far as superior web development is concerned Ruby on Rails enables you to break free from the traditional way of developing a web platform and create something new and innovative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Step-By-Step Guide For Installing Ruby On Rails </b></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, if you want to install Ruby on Rails, then it is mandatory to install the following software in your system.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>A database system</li>
<li>A web server</li>
<li>Rails Framework</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, there are basically two kinds of operating systems where you can install Ruby on Rails – Windows and Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To install Ruby on Windows, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step-1:</b> Download and install the rubyinstaller-2.2.2.x.exe file</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step–2:</b> Install Rails</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step-3:</b> Check whether you have Rails or not by giving the command C:&gt; rails –v. You will get a message that will read, “<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Congratulations! You are now on Rails over Windows.</span></span></span>” This means Ruby on Rails has been installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To install Ruby on Linux, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step – 1</b>: Install the git-core first. Use yum for installing Rail dependencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step -2:</b> Once done, install rbenv and use the following command</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; echo &#8216;export PATH = &#8220;$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH&#8221;&#8216; &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; echo &#8216;eval &#8220;$(rbenv init -)&#8221;&#8216; &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; exec $SHELL</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; echo &#8216;export PATH = &#8220;$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH&#8221;&#8216; &lt;&lt; ~/.bash_profile</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">tp&gt; exec $SHELL</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step -3:</b> Install Ruby using the command tp&gt; rbenv install -v 2.2.3</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step –4:</b> Now, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-nodejs-developer/">Node.js</a> in your system and then you can install the database</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The easy to install process and the flexibility of use makes Ruby on Rails quite popular for developers. It is emerging to be one of the most popular web development platform mostly among the start ups. Although there are a number of open source programming languages which are available, but Ruby on Rails puts developers on the elite category when it comes to delivering the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">best web development and design project</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Ruby on Rails adventure in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">Unified Infotech</a> broke a few months back. Well, to be precise it took off a year ago. We had the sales team ready and a great business model, but we were missing the developers. Therefore, to launch the technology side of things we started our interview session and collected some of the <strong>best Ruby developers</strong> in the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, what actually is <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>? And why our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>website development company</strong></a> is venturing for the same like other companies? Well, we have our DevOps Engineer <strong>SNG</strong> to speak today on RoR, the recent fascination of Team Unified–</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Now, what’s RoR or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> It is just a framework to build websites to make it more affordable to create and maintain, simultaneously offering improved performance and faster development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>When Unified started Rails sites?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> Well, a year back, we have started building rails sites and ever since that, we have successfully created rails sites for our global clientele.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Why we call RoR as the “bang for bucks”?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> As a business owner you get many advantages from RoR as it help you to build a website without compromising on flexibility and performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Tell, the brief story behind the framework</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> Born in 2003 and fathered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson" target="_blank">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> (DHH), along with a software development firm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basecamp_Classic" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>. The story goes like this &#8211; DHH was fed up with the use PHP and Java and though to give up programming and this frustration gave birth to ruby on Rails. It is an open source framework which gives the building blocks to build very own applications. This framework is a collection of shortcuts written in Ruby to build websites faster.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, Ruby on Rails is not a programming language, but rather a framework to build websites with the combination of languages such as Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It covers both front-end and the back-end. This means it will help you to build a cool web application without having to rely on someone else to build the back-end or the front-end. <strong><em><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/why-is-ruby-on-rails-essential-for-startup-coders-a-detailed-study/">A great thing for the Startups</a>, I must say!</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>A brief technical overview on RoR</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> The Ruby projects implement Model-View-Controller, or MVC. MVC splits up the process to get the information faster to the users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Model</strong> – it holds the data for your web applications such as if you have a list of names and the address you can keep it in the model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>View</strong> – It displays the data on what users sees and usually in the form of HTML templates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Controller</strong> – It is just like the coach, the one who calls for the shot. This gets the data from the model and sends it further ahead for the view. The controller allows editing, deleting and reading the data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If I compare the MVC structure to a shop it may sound like this &#8211; The <strong>model</strong> is the backroom or godown to stock materials. The <strong>view</strong> is the showroom to display the items and the prices. The <strong>controller</strong> is the salesperson or the shop’s employee who responds to the customer request of getting the item from the shelf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>How one can get started with Ruby in Rails</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> In the last few years while installing the Ruby on Rails, we have come across a number of tools called installers. The most popular among them are RailsInstaller or <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">rubyonrails.org</a>. In both the websites, a developer gets the information and desired files to install Ruby on Rails on the computer. You will get your <em>Hello World</em> app running in no time!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Now, tell me the benefits of RoR, which the customer might find interesting</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> For a business owner, <a href="https://unifiedinfotech.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/improve-your-business-agility-with-ruby-on-rails-development-services/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> enables three large benefits –</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Have quicker website launch</strong> – The sites, which conventionally took 12 weeks to develop, can now reach its goal in 6 to 7 weeks with RoR. It is time-saving since it is based on few lines of redundant code, reusing the existing components rather than building the site from scratch and use of available plugins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Enables easier changes</strong> &#8211; After you launch a site, the future modifications to your site can be introduced quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. It is cost-effective</strong> &#8211; Since the speed with which Rails site can be built, so the business owners get to spend less to create the main website without compromising on the quality, performance, and scalability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Which industries can benefit from Ruby on Rails?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> Well, Rails is an ideal solution for industries and verticals such as –</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E-commerce</strong> – The e-commerce sites of today can benefit hugely from the RoR and their user-friendly features and their modular approaches. We also include features that are easily found on the big-level e-commerce sites such as uploads in bulk, updates for products, photos, custom pricing algorithms, on-the-fly photo resizing and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Content Management</strong> &#8211; If you want to build a CMS website to stuff thousands of articles, news, audio files or database-friendly contents, rails cane be a primary solution for you. It allows users with navigate freely with the ease and flexibility to upload and manage the content effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Customized solutions</strong> – Most of our clients seek customized solution as per their business need. They require a novel database to support a new business model. In such cases, we find Rails as the ideal partner to build solutions for them at a fraction of cost and time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What must the developers do to keep Ruby on Rails from sagging?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SNG:</strong> Overuse of a technology might die away the interest of the developer to use a technology or framework just as we have enough with PHP and Java, yet they remain the pioneer of the programming world. Similarly, the key philosophy behind Ruby on Rails is not to repeat yourself. Writing code repeatedly is a bad thing, it will be great if you collaborate with other developers for incorporating fresh ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby is able to make assumptions on what you want to do and how. You do not need spend the extra time tweaking every little detail. Ruby comes pre-loaded with out-of-the-box conventions, which help to speed up development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, at the end I can give a quirky tip to all our developer about using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems" target="_blank">Gems</a>, pieces of pre-packaged code that will give you functionality during your development. You do not have to write the code yourself, it’s there done and finished by another talented developer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>In the end…</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a bright conversation on Ruby on Rails over a cup of coffee, it’s time to wrap up. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>Web application development services</strong></a> like Ruby on Rails for quicker progress from the start. Team Unified has analyzed that they can develop a site faster and with more precision, but without spending excessive time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For our developers, Ruby on Rails was great to learn and a breath of fresh air professionally. It is extremely popular among our Startup clients because real-world web applications can be created quickly and easily. However, no one knows the future of programming work, but Ruby is growing strong every day and <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/" target="_blank">Ruby community</a> shows that clearly.</p>

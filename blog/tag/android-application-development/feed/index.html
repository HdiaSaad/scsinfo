										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">With such a variety of Android applications taking off high in the market, it may very well appear a piece of cake to the layman as to an Android application development. Making uncontrollably prevalent applications, the Flappy Bird, for example, is not a simple task. There is a tremendous measure of things to remember while making an android application, and to help you to come nearer to turning into an accomplishment in the field, we have assembled a rundown of fundamental rules that we trust you will need all the while.</p>
<h3>Keep It Simple!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most important factor to keep in mind is that an <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>Android app development</strong></a> should be as simple as possible. The purpose of creating an app can be understood by all age group and not make it “rocket-science like” at all. It is very crucial to remember that you are developing an app to solve a problem and it should be easy to play around with which is again pivotal in keeping matter simple.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">1. Several Platforms and Devices</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Conventional desktop and laptop PCs are Windows-based with a standard screen size, components, and form factor. The mobile landscape is a great deal more divided, with four fundamental stages (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry) that are consistently advancing. In like manner, building mobile applications needs more components to consider when arranging, including which gadget stage to assemble to start with, what versatile innovation choice to pick, what capacities ought to the mobile phone support, and the need for a long-haul guide with sending on additional, next platforms. Rather than customary Windows-based desktop development, versatile engineers need to consider making application code for different stages Android, Windows Phone, iPhone, and BlackBerry. Planning an application that is upgraded for different gadgets with various screen densities and screen sizes is much more difficult.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">2. Screen size</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Applications intended for a desktop or laptop customer work with a screen size that far surpasses that of mobile devices. The most effective method to outline for a gadget that fits in your pocket requires simplifications and a reevaluate about navigation. While a desktop application may have tabs, options, and connections on all sides of the screen and in accordance with content, for mobile you have to focus on the quick capacity, decreasing the number of choices to just those required for the prompt assignment or highlight.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">3. User Interface</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than a mouse and keyboard, there is a very extraordinary mode for client input: touch. Indeed, even a solitary touch can include a variety of interaction, including single tap, double tap, long touch, move, and excursion. Every one of these activities must be captured. Desktop PCs and laptops give consoles to information passage, permitting agreeable, quick writing with both hands and all fingers. Since mobile phones don&#8217;t have that capacity, even those with keyboards, manual information passage ought to be limited. Rather, wherever conceivable, give choices to choosing as opposed to requesting specifics through data entry. Not at all like clicking links with a mouse, tapping links using your fingers on a touch screen mobile phone is difficult. Clients can undoubtedly start a connection they didn&#8217;t expect to tap and incidentally arrive on an undesired page. Bigger bars, tabs or buttons let clients tap with more accuracy.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">4. Screen Density</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gadgets accessible from various producers fluctuate from 120 dpi for the lower-end HTC Tattoo/Wildfire and 240 dpi for the higher end Droid arrangement—a distinction of 100% in screen density. This implies using hard coded values for pixels and a solitary arrangement of pictures will prompt one of two things on a higher end phone: either your UI will be up-scaled and fluffy, or the controls will be too little to permit happy with focusing with a finger. Therefore, you have to package different resolution pictures and utilize display metrics to scale your custom drawing code.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">5. Integration with phone functions</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smartphones are refined specialized gadgets. Making phone calls is their most fundamental capacity. While versatile stages put many constraints on outline and substance, they additionally open up new opportunities that conventional desktops can&#8217;t give. For instance, reconciliation with telephone capacities, for example, coordinate calling and content informing gives clients a chance to choose a telephone number from a rundown, then call or content that number without typing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another case: capacities, for example, GPS can be incorporated into location based administrations like mobile search. Numerous mobile devices can naturally recognize client nearness and give them nearby indexed lists, making effective open doors for organizations to advance their offerings in view of a man&#8217;s vicinity to their place of business and their immediate intent.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">6. Limited CPU/Memory/Battery Resources</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cell phones do not have the processing force and memory limit of most desktop and server frameworks. Designers need to compose calculations and perform code enhancement to bolster the mobile device limit. For instance, 1 GB of memory is an imperative in cell phones which is not found in today&#8217;s desktop applications. That is not the same to the extent the phones go. Gadgets accessible from various manufacturers change from 120 dpi for the lower-end HTC Tattoo/Wildfire and 240 dpi for the higher end Droid arrangement—a distinction of 100% in screen thickness. This implies using hard coded values for pixels and a single set of pictures will prompt one of two things on a higher end phone: either your UI will be up-scaled and fluffy, or the controls will be too little to permitting happy with focusing with a finger. Along these lines, you have to package numerous determination pictures and utilize show measurements to scale your custom drawing code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another issue that desktop/web applications don&#8217;t need to address is battery life. With desktop/web applications, you can have complex calculations running on the server because there are no battery imperatives. Be that as it may, in regards to mobile, a perplexing calculation or problematic code will deplete the battery rapidly. When outlining calculations, engineers need to consider battery utilization and plan for ideal use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In today’s world of rapid digital transformation, it doesn’t matter which brand of mobile phone do you own, what matters is how interactive is the user interface of your mobile. When it comes to an android device, designing a standard user interface takes the user experience a long way. A great user interface is key for making a greater android device experience whether it’s in a Smartphone or a Tablet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Designing a user interface does not solve the purpose of a great UI experience. An <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>android application development company </b></a>has to keep in mind about the different kinds of screen resolutions of the android devices and design accordingly. For instance: the UI design for a Smartphone with less than 600 dpi will be different from that of a Tablet with more than 720 dpi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UIPL has come out with awesome UI designing tips for android devices that will totally stand out from others.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Keep The Screen Density In Mind</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Screen density is an important area of consideration, which is to be taken into account while designing for an android device. Most of the time designers only consider the screen size, but they forget that it is the density of the screen, which means the dot per inch (in technical terms DPI) that matter the most. For instance: Nexus One and Nexus 5 have the same screen size but they vary from each other when it comes to screen density. While Nexus One has a pixel density of 252 DPI –HDPI, on the other hand, Nexus 5 has a pixel density of 445 dpi-XXHDPI.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Always Evaluate The Impact Of Density Independent Pixels</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes a button with a certain pixel might appear small on a high-end android device. One can overcome this problem by opting for density-independent pixels. Thus, the images will appear as a standard size on a variety of android devices starting from a Smartphone to a Tablet. Always keep in mind that images play a very vital role in creating a rich UI experience. Hence, it is the responsibility of a designer to optimize the images depending upon the screen density of a device.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Make Alternative Resource Folders for Easy Work</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thousands of images and layouts are created for devices with different screen resolutions and densities. This always creates confusion among designers; hence, it is recommended that you always maintain an alternative resource folder for individual screen density. Keep DPI as the base density and you can easily store the images and layouts in drawable folders that are most appropriate for you. When it comes to basic android mobile application development<b>, </b>alternative resource folders ease your work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4345" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot-2-1.png" alt="android mobile application" width="857" height="381" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot-2-1.png 857w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot-2-1-300x133.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot-2-1-768x341.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" /></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Separate Layouts For Different Screen Densities</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Always design multiple layouts for different devices with various screen densities. An Android Phone scales all the bitmap drawable as well as Nine-patch drawable in order to optimize the layout with the size of the device. However, the functionality differs in case of an Android Smartphone and Tablet. In the settings section of Android, the list of settings and the details will open in a different screen on a mobile phone; whereas, in a Tablet, the setting list and details will open side by side. One mistake that is committed by UI designers is that they use activities individually, as a result of which three types of problem rise – the risk of tight coupling, intent filters, complicated intents and security issues.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Fragment Activity </b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every fragment has its own life cycle. It is hosted by a number of activities and can be replaced anytime with another fragment. The interesting thing is that the fragments are hosted within one activity without any interrelation between them. In order to create a dynamic UI, convert the components and activity behaviors into modules. These modules act as a nested activity that defines their layout and manage the lifecycle.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">List and details are displayed in two activities in a mobile phone. The folder structure should be designed in such a way that it contains both the list and detail activity. To have a clear directory structure, always maintain the list fragments in ListActivity.XML folder and the detail fragment under DetailActivity.XML folder. It is important to keep in mind that the directory structure of a Tablet is entirely different from that of a Smartphone. The resolution should be kept at 600 dp and the ListActivity should contain both list and detail fragment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To sum it up, in a mobile, DetailActivity that hosts detail fragment should be launched, whereas, in a Tablet, Detail and List fragment should be launched.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to identify the layout that has to be inflated, Android OS takes out the layout from folders on the basis of the width of the screen and inflates it on the basis of that particular layout. The OS first determines the drawable folder and if it doesn&#8217;t find any relevant images, then it transfers the images to a lower level folder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Last Thoughts</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Android has a flexible framework for a better user interface that helps users to view the apps or any other information in different devices. With the constant evolution of mobile technology, new challenges are emerging for UI designers. With the frequent changes in screen resolutions and their dimensions, it is time to take a big leap in UI designing. The designing tips mentioned above are simple and if followed will definitely start a new era in the field of UI designing for android devices.</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/mhealth-app-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted on the regional market valuation of healthcare app market reveals that North America dominated the healthcare application market in terms of revenue share. </span></li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_12042" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12042" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12042 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/global-mhealth-apps-market.png" alt="healthcare mobile app development market" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/global-mhealth-apps-market.png 600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/global-mhealth-apps-market-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12042" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Grandviewresearch.com</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/11/e15195"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted among the nurses of the Nursing Association of Barcelona revealed that about 48.35% of the respondents had healthcare apps installed on their smartphones. Along with that, 80% of revealed that these apps should be certified by health and professional institutes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accenture’s </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">study on Medical apps shows</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 78% of all consumers are interested in receiving virtual healthcare services. However, right now only 21% of them have received services that way. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your healthcare application development can only succeed if it solves a problem and right now there are many problems with the healthcare industry in the world. To validate your idea, make sure that your app solves at least one of these following problems &#8211; </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Managing paperwork</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are still many clinics and hospitals that maintain records on paper. Managing this paperwork takes a lot of time, as it shows in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">study about how nurses use their working hours</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the study, nurses spend about 35.3% time in documentation. Which is a lot of time to spend on documentation. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Data management in healthcare mobile app development</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing data in a disparate system is one of the many problems that plague the healthcare industry. The absence of a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">centralized system prevents doctors from providing proper medical care on time. It also prevents pharmaceutical workers from maintaining accurate records for medicine manufacturing and delivery</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Disconnected tech</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference in the formulary, connectivity, communicatory and security protocols between various healthcare organizations creates an impossible to manage the environment. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Variation in process</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disconnected tech creates the problem of variation in the process between different organizations. The serious lack of integration forces the staff to create and adhere to their own process, creating a serious variation in the process and preventing the unification of the healthcare industry.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you are sure of your idea, you can move onto the next step of development- choosing the app type.</span></p>
<h2 id="Choosing_the_right_app_type"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Choose The Right Healthcare Application Type</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are various problems related to the medical industry. As a result, there are different types of medical apps. And before starting with development, you have to choose the type of app you want to build. Here is a list of all types of professional medical apps in the market right now. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12057 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/heathcare-app-types.jpg" alt="types of healthcare apps" width="825" height="692" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/heathcare-app-types.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/heathcare-app-types-300x252.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/heathcare-app-types-768x644.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that the kind of application you choose will have an impact on the kind of features you’ll need to integrate into the app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Networking Apps For Healthcare Professionals</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Networking apps for healthcare professionals work just like any other professional apps. These apps create a streamlined experience for doctors and nurses alike to connect with other professionals in the same field, interact with them and share news relevant to the healthcare industry easily. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Medical database apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical database apps help professionals to store and access data easily. The types of data that can be stored and accessed through a medical database app may include &#8211;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patient’s details (illness, what treatment they are receiving, who is treating them what medicine they are being given)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicine inventory details</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctor and nurse’s contact information</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The database application helps the professionals access the right data at the right time, and edit it when required. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Clinical Assistance Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With clinical assistance applications, doctors can easily view laboratory results, the patient’s vital charts, symptoms and has access to all-round assistance all the time. These hospital management mobile apps continuously help the doctors to diagnose and treat the patients with accuracy. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Patient Health Tracking Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The patient health tracking apps help the doctors to keep track of a patient’s health even after they have left the hospital. These apps keep track of the patient’s vitals and help alert the doctors if the vitals drop below or go above the average. Perfect for patients of fluctuating blood pressure, diabetes, and many others, these apps can be a lifesaver if developed perfectly. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Doctor-on-demand apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients don’t always have time to visit a doctor’s office and that’s where doctor-on-demand apps come in. Working as a virtual chamber, these apps help the patients and doctors to connect through video and audio calls, providing the patients with instant advice on how to deal with the health problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After choosing the type of application, you have to choose the features. Remember that the feature list will vary for different types of healthcare mobile app development. Here we are going to discuss some <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/make-health-fitness-workout-tracker-app/">basic features required to create functional mobile medical apps</a> for healthcare professionals. You can talk to your app development partner about app-specific features. </span></p>
<h2 id="Finalize_the_different_sides_of_your_application"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Different Sides of The Healthcare/Medical App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every app has at least two sides of it, the admin panel, and the user app. The same applies to your healthcare application. To make a functional medicine health application you have to develop an admin panel and a user app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. The Admin Panel</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The admin panel is like the brain of the application. Admin panel is used to manage every aspect of the application, from managing the list of doctors to the appointments booked on the application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the admin panel, you won’t be able to completely manage the functionalities of the application. It is the web-based application that’ll help the authorized personnel to have control over the app and its functionalities. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. The User App</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user application is the business end of the application. This is the part that will be used by healthcare professionals. During development, make sure that the app includes necessary features for the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is incredibly important for the user app to be well designed and developed. It is the business end and it has to impress the users, help them perform the tasks smoothly and provide value to them. </span></p>
<h2 id="Designing_a_medical_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Designing a Medical App: The Things to Consider</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing mobile medical apps is a different thing altogether. Medical applications created for industry professionals need to follow some basic principles, which are-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. The Principle Of Simplicity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is designed mainly for the treatment of patients, medical applications need to have a simple, intuitive design. A healthcare application does not need any extra flashy design elements, added embellishments and effects. During the design process make sure there are no excess elements to the app. Create a straightforward design that helps the users to make the best of it. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. The Principle Of Sensible Colors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is best to choose sensible colors when designing a healthcare app. Most successful medical applications use sober colors in their designs. You should also consider the age group of the target audience. Choosing the right color palette helps you a lot in user retention. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. The Principle Of Readability</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhancing readability should be important for your medical app&#8217;s design. Using fancy fonts looks good, but makes the app hard to use. So choose an easy-to-read font style, and don’t use more than two styles in the app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. The Principle Of Responsive Design</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsive design for mobile applications is a given these days, thanks to the wide range of devices being used by industry professionals these days. So make sure that the app is designed to fit any screen the user might be using. </span></p>

<h2 id="Legal_regulations_to_keep_up_with"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Complying With Legal Regulations &#8211; Check Out The Country Rules</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many security regulations you should consider before launching a healthcare application. The architecture of the application needs to be designed properly. And it must meet all the security and privacy regulations set by the governmental bodies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security and privacy regulations tend to vary with the different regions in the world. Make sure that the app follows the laws of different regions before launching. Here are some regulatory laws set by governmental bodies all around the world. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">USA</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To launch a medical application for the USA market that transmits Protected Health Information (PHI) of a patient must be in compliance with the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This act regulated how protected health information is sent back and forth between the servers and forces limitations on the access to individually identifiable healthcare information to the unauthorized personnel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your application will fall under <a href="https://www.jotform.com/what-is-hipaa-compliance/">HIPAA compliance</a> if it contains PHI and it is shared by the covered organizations like hospitals. Any healthcare apps that don&#8217;t contain PHI falls under the Non-HIPAA category. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada sets out the parameters for the use of personal data through the </span><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8.6/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The act sets out privacy rules for the use of personal information for businesses, including medical apps. The Canadian government uses this act to regulate the use of personal data by businesses.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Union</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking to launch your medical app in Europe, you have to make sure that your app complies with the </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Data Protection Regulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in effect since 2018 May. GDPR specifies how businesses can treat personal data and how they should protect it. The regulation applies to all EU citizens. Collecting and using medical data of the EU citizens makes the application subject of GDPR regulation. Under GDPR any data identifying username, password, photos, health records, etc are considered as personal data. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK you have to follow the Data Protection Act for patient care apps. It regulates and sets out the limits on the usage and storage of personal information. According to the law, the uses should be detailed in the privacy policy.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asian regions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data privacy laws vary greatly all over the Asia Pacific region. And to launch your mobile applications for the health sector you have to become familiar with them. The data protection laws change over time in this region. It seems to take a similar shape to the General Data Protection Regulation in use in the EU. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of all the variations, two laws stand out. Japan’s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), dating back to 2003, acts as the oldest law in this field. Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) is extremely strict. It has some of the toughest penalties for those who misuse personal information of the users. </span></p>
<h2 id="Monetizing_your_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Revenue Models for Professional Healthcare App</span></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From a basic communication device to using it as a virtual reality device, there are merely any functions left behind by mobile technology. By introducing extended capabilities, it has helped mankind to witness the technological upsurge in a rapid phase, but what lies next? Is there something more in store? Will mobile technology amaze us with new discoveries? Such questions are bound to come in our minds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout this blog, we will share with you the upcoming changes which you are all set to witness in the field of <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a> and how will mobile technology shape up the world in the years to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s put an end to all your curiosity and present to you the future of mobile technology which we and the coming generation are going to witness.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‘Augmented Reality’ Close To Reality</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Virtual Reality is making news everywhere, Augmented Reality is the next one in the line. Using the GPS on your smartphone to find the nearest restaurant or places of interest is a cliché now. Augmented Reality will enable users to find them offline just by activating their camera. Yes, this is going to be this easy. In the next few years, this feature will undergo many new transformations to give the user more relevant search results. Combining computer data and fetching it to the users in real time will be a challenging task, though, but nevertheless, it will pave the way for mobile app development.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Foldable Flexible Screens</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tired of carrying your large screen Smartphones everywhere? Why not fold it? Yes, the dream of carrying that large screen smartphone will finally come true as foldable screens will come in the near future to make your phone pocket-friendly. The Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) technology will make this possible. This means you can view from both sides of the phone and perform dual activities from both sides. If accepted well, by the masses, it can further evolve into a wearable device. Imagine you are wearing your smartphone on your wrist. An interesting concept. Isn’t it?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advanced Voice Control</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The voice recognition system will now be at its best. Many researches have been done in order to develop the quality of voice, but time and again it has proved to be a hectic task. Just as Siri introduced the system of voice recognition by interpreting the diction and syntax of the speech, in the same way, use of a natural user interface at a more advanced level will overtake the current way of communication. Seamless voice control will emerge as the next voice control app. Such kind of feature will increase the interactivity as far as Smartphones are concerned. Thus, this mobile technology will certainly prove to be the best.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Moving Beyond 3D Screens</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Apple has raised the bar with retina display, the introduction of 3D screens have brought forward crystal clear screen display by enabling the user to view from three dimensions. The more advanced level of viewing experience beyond 3D could be the use of holograms. This could totally change our viewing experience in a smartphone. Integrating the movements along with the 3D displays will allow you to compress or adjust the size of your pictures just with the help of a single touch.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What To Expect From Android In The Future ?</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than half of the mobile population around the world makes use of Android Smartphones.</p>
<h3><strong>1. An All New Google Map</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can expect a much more sophisticated version of the Google Maps with helpful features. Google is already in talks for hiring the street view cameras so that it can allow the users to get a clear inside view of a building or a monument. Detailing will be the primary focus of the app.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. More Secured Payments </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though many secured methods for payments have been adopted such as OTP and an SSL payment gateway, but in the near future, it is all set to get complicated, so that transaction becomes much easier. Fingerprint recognition and iris scanning can be the next process of payment.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Innovation In Hardware</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There could be a complete change in the hardware of your smartphone. As discussed in this blog earlier, that one could also see a foldable screen in the future. In future, Smartphones could be the new wearables and will completely change the way we communicate with a mobile.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What To Expect From iOS In The Future?</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the Worldwide Developer’s Conference, 2016, Tim Cook announced a number of technological upgrades apart from releasing iOS10.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Upgraded iMessaging </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the recently released version of iOS10, one can reply to a message instantly on receiving the notifications. In the near future, the focus of Apple will be to extend the concept of messaging to third parties. Moreover, the secondary focus will be mainly on increasing the font size and creating bigger emoticons.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Improving the User Interface</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In each version, Apple has upgraded its user interface, but what holds in the near future is really a matter of curiosity for iPhone lovers. Shifting to OLED screens is an indication that can change the user interface that Apple has been maintaining all the while. As a result, the user can benefit from saving the battery even in dark mode.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Richer Notifications  </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apple has taken a significant leap as far as adjusting the notifications are concerned. Media rich notifications will be the key agenda and no application will be required to open in order to view the notifications box. This up gradation will pull the user more towards installing the application.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Transformation For Business </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the years to come, mobile technology will have a transformational effect on the business. Starting from IT to marketing and corporate sector, it will have a chain of effects and will drastically change the way we work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rise Of The Virtual Office</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By 2020, it is expected that one doesn’t need to be physically present at the workstation. Digital space will overtake the cabins and desks. With the rapid evolution of video calls, messaging and email, business houses need to strategize in the most calculative manner in order to get the work done.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mobile Tech To Become A Real Player</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, most of the people around the world depend on a smartphone rather than on his laptop or computer. With the massive mobile user around the world, there is no doubt that in future, people are mostly going to use their mobile for all kinds of official work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ERP Systems To Rise</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The need to real time availability of business reports and data is becoming the need of the hour in this era of competitive business development. Everything must be at your fingertips every time. With the introduction of ERP, you will have access to custom reports from anywhere. Hence, this will ease the process of business development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile devices have revolutionized our life since their advent and it will continue to amaze us with their amazing impact.</p>

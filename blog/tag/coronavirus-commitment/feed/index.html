										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has brought everyone to their knees. Since the day it was declared to be a global catastrophe, till right now, it has not only put a stop to normal business processes but has turned the standard industry work processes upside down on its head.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, after more than 6 months, we have settled into this new normal of working from home. But there are still a few questions our clients might have about our work/business process. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it is about our communication process, or productivity and quality of delivery, all these queries and their answers are going to be of paramount importance for you to make the final call about your project.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an establishment that believes in complete transparency, we have heard your questions, and bring the answers to you. So no matter what the questions are, you can find all those answers right here!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/portfolio/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12851 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15.jpg" alt="our portfolio" width="1650" height="1200" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-1536x1117.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></a></p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Transitions: WFO To WFH, How Your Project Is Going To Be Affected?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/">100% transition of work model that appeared within our organization</a> in less than two days had zero impact on our ongoing projects. Keeping in mind the security of our clients, we ensured that they don’t have to travel to the office for any work purposes. Through the necessary migration of infrastructure, we enabled them to keep up the good work right from the safety of their home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pre-existing remote operation model has helped us even more to embrace this new situation. Instead of wondering about what to do in the face of this unique challenge, we have taken advantage of all aspects and ensured that none of our existing and future clients are affected by this crisis.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Disruption In Communication: We Are Always Here!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business person about to hire a web development partner has only one question- how will the partner be able to keep the communication smooth?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely, social distancing and quarantining measurements have made it hard to keep in touch with people. However, having already anticipated these issues, we implemented the right solutions from the very beginning. And after 6 months, we can proudly say that the timely action has paid off </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that further reiterates our earned feather-in-the-cap of being one of the </span><b>Top Casablanca App Development Agencies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using various collaboration tools, such as Skype, Jira, Asana, Slack, Zoom, Trello, Invision we have created a strong communication network within our teams. The interconnected teams with the above-mentioned tools have operated efficiently from the very beginning and will continue to do so till time immemorial (in case things don’t change!).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now the matter of interconnected teams brings us to the next question-</span></p>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Well The Interlinked Processes Are Working In These Times?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaboration is key, and when it comes to more complex projects, such as a tiered web and app development/design process, collaboration happens to be the ultimate element that keeps the work process going.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our client’s (and of course, yours) multifaceted projects, we have integrated agile collaboration methods that help us to not just stay connected, but solve problems even when we are miles away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tried and tested method has been a part of our work process from the very beginning. And now, our Agile teams are able to apply this system to collaborate better on your projects. Using this, we have eliminated departmental silos, enabling our multidisciplinary teams to collaborate across the establishment and deliver quality products.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is The Crisis In Any Way Going To Affect The Quality Of Service? What About Productivity?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the industry-wide sacrifices and compromises, we are still on track to deliver the very best. The crisis is not something we have not faced in the past, but we’ve always had a contingency plan in place for any kind of risk management.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12972 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-1024x492.jpg" alt="corona work from home" width="1024" height="492" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-1024x492.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-768x369.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-1536x737.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-2048x983.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interdisciplinary team members spread out across their homes are in constant touch (figure of speech) with each other through the collaboration tools we have already mentioned, along with the more conventional tools of communication such as emails, phone calls, and video calls.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, we implemented the use of time tracking tools to ensure that our team members can achieve stability between work and life and are always fit (both psychologically and physically) to deliver the highest quality of work.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Happens When Your Point Of Contact Falls Victim To The Virus?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of our Unified team members, from the very beginning of this pandemic, have taken every precaution to prevent falling ill. Our remote operation model ensures that team members don’t have to travel for any work purpose. However, there’s no denying the fact that the virus can not be controlled.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if unfortunately, your point of contact with us does fall ill, we have backup plans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to ensure that our commitment towards the project as repute as one of the </span><b>Top Casablanca User Experience Agencies </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">remains unperturbed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While the sick individual recovers, we can continue with your projects, without any disruption. All our project administrators, developers, and designers are available to help with your site or app at any time.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_6" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Kind Of Help Will You Get From Our Management?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each member of our workforce is ready to support you during this disastrous time. From our management members, you can get precious consultations on how your business can function and succeed in this new normal. Whether you are an enterprise looking to reinvent, or a startup wondering how to make it in the industry, we have all the right advice that is optimized for this new pandemic market.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_7" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is SCS INFO Following The Downsizing Methods Like Everyone Else?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not really! In fact, if anything, our family has only grown in the past couple of months. Judging and understanding the requirements of the current landscape, we were able to develop apps and websites for our clients that leveraged the current needs of the audience out there. This pivoting technique has helped us to garner even more clients and to facilitate their projects, we hired innovative experts from many different disciplines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downsizing during a crisis is not our style. Rather we like to engage the expertise of our teams to improve upon the work even more. And that result is quite clear from our revenue numbers. Additionally, we are also using this work from home time to up-skill our employees.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_8" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Kind Of Training Campaign Do We Have Going On?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our organization-wide training sessions have been designed to include a vast array of technical and development skill training modules. From web development, design, android/iOS design patterns to generic soft skill, we are aiming to help the team members to become even more proficient in their skills. This will help us deliver better results to you!</span></p>
<h2 id="id_8" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Next?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic is not gone, and the slow unlocking process is not picking up speed anytime soon. And in this new normal, we have all strategies in place to keep delivering quality service to you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we can not predict the future, we can tell you about our plans. The work from the home landscape has made us confident in our skill to work remotely without any compromise in quality. Now we can focus on building a global team of designers and developers who can leverage the remote working system. A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd focus</span> in creating quality websites and apps for our clients.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<h4><span style="color: #000080;">Fact check 01: As many as 76% of the companies surveyed in the Coding Sans report admit that they allow their employees to work remotely.</span></h4>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="text-align: left;">Organizations are looking ahead to creating prominent attention on digital platforms. Simultaneously, there has been a significant shift towards developing applications with the help of &#8211;</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">With low code app development of enterprise software, organizations can expect cost-cutting and less complicated projects.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">#Trending 2: Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">By 2020, the revenue of AI will possibly reach $156.5 billion, which is a 12% growth as compared to last year. Multiple businesses now, irrespective of the genre of their trade, have found their anchor in AI. The most prominent of the fields is cybersecurity because</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">It can spot malicious software and activity patterns to identify threats.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Conveniently detect questionable IP addresses and data breaches.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">For firms targeting cybersecurity as their priority, AI is one of the major software development trends. This is also crucial when considering hyper-automation to boost the quality of day-to-day life and functionalities. Then there is also the topic of conversational IT providing benefit to the sales, marketing, and customer support teams of an organization.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">#Trending 3: Native and Progressive Apps</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Native apps were, are, and will be on the enterprise software development trends radar because of how businesses target smartphone users. The idea here is to enhance brand performance and hone the client experience significantly over native apps development in both iOS and Android platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The wild card entry into this app development genre is that of the Progressive Web Apps or PWAs. Built upon the latest APIS, the PWAs designs are meant to offer a honed CX.

</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">As technology gets more bewitching in 2021, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/progressive-web-apps-the-future-of-app-development/">Progressive Web Apps – the future of app development</a> will start to star the show in the coming years and reign the app world. In case you are a budding entrepreneur, or one looking to make a great return, post the pandemic outbreak, this might be just the approach for you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">#Trending 4: Human Augmentation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">As and how time progresses, it is becoming steadily evident that augmentation has a promising future. Considering how it acts as an extended version of the humans (since it integrates with the human body), this is not surprising.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As enterprise software development trends go, human augmentation in its various forms &#8211; VR, AR, and MR are sure to get its peak of fame by 2021. Here’s a brief glimpse of what they are and their probable potential.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Virtual Reality (VR)</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Have you noticed how the video and gaming industry seems to have had a mushroom-like growth over the last few years? Well, the growth rate has been an exponential one.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Much of this growth is owing to the enhanced boon of Virtual Reality. VR offers its users a 1st-person perspective and immersive experience from the advanced computerized visions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As expected, multiple enterprises have already started tapping into their potential to overcome diverse challenges and issues in their genres of trade. VR is no longer the monopoly of the video and the gaming industries. It has found its utility across diverse genres that include the education and the training sector. Schools and other educational institutions have started making ways for introducing VR into their classrooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As far as the corporate houses are concerned, the story is no different there! 2020 showcased how the game plan for all organizations is all about user-centrism. For corporates, this is all that they require as an incentive to adopt VR in 2021!</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Augmented Reality (AR)</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Augmented Reality has been a hit in the year 2020 and is predicted to continue its hold in 2021 as well. Much of this technology’s success is owing to its utility across a majority of the architecture industries like retail, navigation, and manufacturing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As and how Facebook and Instagram get layered with AR in the ad formats and filters, the trend has become undeniable and holds much potential for 2021. While the virtual makeover brings forth a completely different dimension, how can enterprise software development fall behind on this trend?</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Mixed Reality (MR)</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The perfect combination of AR and VR, Mixed Reality, or MR holds considerable prospects in the field of enterprise application development. As per predictions made in an Industry ARC market research report, the MR market will witness a <a href="https://www.devteam.space/blog/10-trends-in-software-development/">CAGR of 73.% from 2018 to 2023, while its market size grows from $1.054 billion in 2017 to $9.982 billion in 2024</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MR brings out the best of the two human augmentation forms of AR and VR &#8211;</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">AR &#8211; the blending of digital content with the user’s actual surroundings</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">VR &#8211; the immersive experience created for the users.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">As of now, multiple companies involved in the sectors of</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Tourism,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Gaming,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Defense,</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">To ace this step, our experts have dug up the utopic amalgamation of the Scrum/<a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/agile-software-development-process/">Agile software development methodology</a> and the Waterfall software development methods to bring on the perfect software solution.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 4: Testing</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The penultimate stage of the development cycle is all about testing. Considering the kind of importance that this step holds in creating glitch-free software, we consider a wide range of testing. It includes manual, unit, security, regression, and Google webmaster testing. As a result, we guarantee enterprise software solutions that surpass the preset benchmark.</p>

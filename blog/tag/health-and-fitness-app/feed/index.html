<h4>1. Affordable and Accessible Fitness Regime</h4>



<p>Let&#8217;s face it, getting a personal trainer is not only hard, but it is also a costly procedure.</p>



<p>It is a trial and error thing. You never know if the instructor you hired would be the proper fit for you or not. Not to mention that getting a personal trainer is also extremely costly.  </p>



<p>But with a fitness app installed on the phone can change the work out the style of a person. There is no need for a new trainer or instructor anymore. All someone needs to do is to get the right app for them and they are ready to start on their fitness journey.</p>



<h4>2. Set A ‘Realistic’ Fitness Goal</h4>



<p>None of us have the patience to wait until we get the perfect body.</p>



<p>Which is why most of us will begin with the most unrealistic goal to get the perfect body as soon as we can. But fitness doesn’t work that way.</p>



<p>This is why fitness apps are becoming so popular today. They are not only helping us get the perfect body, but they are helping us to set the helpful and realistic fitness goals we need.</p>

<h4>3. Easily Monitor The Workout Routine</h4>



<p>Fitness apps help us to monitor and track our workout routine. This way we can know where exactly we are in our fitness calendar. It is the easiest and best possible way to track our progress.</p>



<p>Fitness apps will ask for information such as what we had for breakfast, lunch or dinner, and calculate our calorie intake. And then they would monitor our activity level such as how much we exercised during the day, or how many steps we walked and tell us how many calories we burned during the activity and how to make we need to burn. This is one of the biggest reasons why fitness apps have become so popular.  </p>



<h4>4. No More Boredom, New Ideas For Workout Routines</h4>



<p>The same workout routine every day is bound to get boring and as a result, you can get demotivated as well.  Which is why fitness apps are all in vogue now.</p>



<p>The best fitness apps out there will give you a new idea for your work out regime every day, switching things up so that you don’t feel bored while going through your work out session.</p>



<h4>5. Eat Healthy With Healthy Eating Habits</h4>



<p>Working out is the only way of getting the perfect body, you have to eat right for it as well.</p>



<p>Which is why most fitness apps also have a diet section, where they suggest new and healthy eating habits which will help us with our fitness goals. These healthy eating tips not only help us in getting in perfect shape but improves our lifestyle as well.</p>



<h4>6. Connect To People With The Same Goals</h4>



<p>Working out alone can be a lonely thing.</p>



<p>Fitness apps with their social integration help the users to find more people who have the same fitness goals as well. They can share their success stories and keep motivating each other to live a better healthier lifestyle.</p>

<h2 id="step2">2. Decide Between The Types of fitness apps</h2>



<p>The second step in fitness and health app development process is to figure out what kind of fitness app you want to make.</p>



<p>To develop a fitness app, you need to know about the different types of fitness apps and how they help people with fitness. The fitness app developers need to be familiar with the various types of fitness apps to integrate the proper features into it.</p>



<h4>1. Activity Tracking App</h4>



<p>Just like its name, the activity tracking app tracks the activity level of the user.</p>



<p>Whatever the user does this app will track it. From how many steps were taken during the day to the number of stairs climbed, distance run, all this information will be collected by this app. And as a result, it will show you how many calories you have burned during the day while doing these mundane physical activities.</p>



<p>The user data is usually displayed on the screen and the app makes charts and graphs recording the user’s activity level and their progress. This is the very basic form of the fitness app model and is made for the very basic users who want to get fit but cannot give time for a rigorous training schedule.</p>



<h4>2. Diet And Nutrition App</h4>



<p>The diet and nutrition is the fitness app for the more health conscious ones, the ones who are a strong believer of the fact that “you are what you eat”.</p>



<p>These apps not only help the users to monitor what they are eating but also helps them to keep firm control over what they are eating. The diet app helps the users literally count the calories of what they are eating throughout the day. The users can keep an eye on how many calories they are consuming, and burning through physical exercise, control water balance of their body, and keep track of their body weight.</p>



<p>Focused mainly on the nutritional aspect of fitness, users can get a vast range of dietary services like set up personal diet charts, create grocery lists, meal planning, healthy cooking tips, etc. this is a fine way of finally sticking to the diet without having continuous cheat days.</p>



<h4>3. Workout App</h4>



<p>This app is for the fitness freaks.</p>



<p>The workout app or the high-intensity interval training app is for the person who is dedicated to getting fit through exercising. This app is like having a personal fitness trainer in your smartphone. The workout app will provide the user with a proper set of exercises based on the personal information updated on the app.</p>



<p>The workout apps are perfect for the ones who have made gymming their religion. This is the best way to keep the users motivated to go to the gym every day or at least workout every day, even if it is in their home.</p>



<p>The workout apps give stats and details on how each kind of exercise will help you and which are the best workout regime for you. It will also help you to set a fitness goal and show you your progress.</p>



<h4>4. Mental Wellness And Meditation App</h4>



<p>Being fit physically is not enough, you need to be mentally fit as well.</p>



<p>Which is why there are so many mental wellness apps in the market. These apps come with a range of meditation and calmness exercises that the user can practice anytime anywhere. These apps are mainly aimed at gaining mental peace in this hectic everyday life.</p>



<p>The mental wellness apps offer not only meditation exercise, but they also come with a range of relaxing sounds to listen to when the user is trying to focus on their work, along with breathing exercise tips. The mental wellness apps are the perfect app for those who don’t have time to go to the yoga class anymore.</p>



<h2 id="step3">3. The MVP Features To Consider Before You Develop A Fitness App</h2>



<p>Once you have considered the types and decided that you want to make a fitness app for your business, you need to consider the MVP features for it. In order to make an application, you need to consider <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mvp-precursor-successful-product-seems-yes-pratip-biswas/" target="_blank">the importance of the MVP features first</a>.</p>



<p>The MVP features are the very basic and minimum features your app needs to function as a fitness app. No matter what kind of app you choose to make, these features will be common for all of them.</p>



<h4>1. Sign Up &amp; Login- The Most Used App Feature</h4>



<p>Fitness apps are highly personalized apps. They need personal details like the user’s age, weight, personal habits and such. And to keep a track of these details, there needs to be a sign in and login feature.</p>



<p>The user should be able to make up a personal account on your fitness app. Give them the option to sign up using both email and social media sites like facebook and google. Make sure not to make the signup process too complicated, otherwise, the user might get annoyed and switch to another app.</p>



<p>The feature of signing up is not only for handling personal information, but it will also help the user to sync their data through various devices.</p>



<h4>2. Personal Account And Management &#8211; Second Most Used App Feature</h4>



<p>After the login and sign up feature comes to the feature of managing the personal account. The various details the user needs to put in the app are handled from this section. With the personal account, the user is going to be able to handle all the information in one place easily.</p>



<p>They can have the option to personalize the app features like the measurement metrics, enabling them to choose between pounds and kilograms, feet and meters, etc. remember to make these measurements international since your app will be used by people from many different countries.</p>



<h4>3. Device Connectivity &#8211; Connect To That Wearable</h4>



<p>Almost everyone today is using some kind of wearable device to track their fitness. So it is important for your app to be able to connect with the wearable device and sync the data accordingly. This way the user can have seamless access to all their fitness data both on their wearable and their phone.</p>



<h4>4. Activity Tracking &amp; Activity Log- Track The Activity Easily</h4>



<p>Any fitness app has the feature of tracking user activity and keeping a proper log. The activity the fitness app will be tracking are walking, running, cycling, and swimming. Through this activity tracking feature, the app keeps a  log of health and fitness stats of the user, such as how many calories burned, how many steps taken and miles run. Along with this you can create your own workout plan app, or add this feature to the activity tracking app to make it easy for users to plan their work out.</p>



<p>This feature can be used in both ways, with a Fitbit, and with a smartphone sensor.</p>



<h4>5. Geolocation &#8211; Locating The Fitness</h4>



<p>The geolocation feature is important for a fitness app.</p>



<p>Firstly it helps the user to track their walking and running route. This way they can keep a track of how many miles they have walked or run, and how many calories they have burned with that.</p>



<p>Secondly, because it adds another layer of personalization to the app. With the geolocation feature, the users can get fitness tips based on their continent, country, weather, etc. because of course, the fitness regime for someone living in MAis not going to be similar to someone living in China. Which is why to make your fitness app even more personalized, make sure to integrate geolocation feature to your app.</p>



<h4>6. Notification &#8211; Notify When The Fitness Is Almost Achieved</h4>



<p>Don’t we all love to be reminded that we were supposed to work out but we forgot?</p>



<p>Okay, maybe we don’t. But the push notification is still a great feature for the fitness app you want to make. The notifications can give the users useful details and reminders such as workout routine reminder, new ideas about exercising, how many calories they have burned, etc.</p>



<p>But do give the users option to mute the notifications. Not all users are going to want to receive notifications all the time. So give them options to change the notification settings if they have to.</p>



<h4>7. Target Setting &#8211; To Complete The Fitness Goal</h4>



<p>With this feature, you can give the users a chance to set up daily, weekly and monthly fitness goals. This will help them stay motivated and help them get fit faster.</p>



<p>You can also integrate the feature of the auto setting the daily target. With this, the app will set the targets for the user itself. Based on the information entered by the user. This way they will not set up impractical goals and lose motivation midway and stop using the app.</p>



<h4>8. Workout Tips &#8211; Helping The User To Get In Shape</h4>



<p>With this, you can give the users small fitness tips and tricks to keep them constantly motivated. These small workout tips can help them to get fit faster, something we all dream of.</p>



<h4>9. Settings &#8211; The Way To Personalize The App</h4>



<p>The setting is an obvious feature in any app, but in your fitness app, you can make this the ultimate personalization center. You can stuff the settings feature with as many options as you want, just make sure that it is comprehensible by the user.</p>



<h2 id="step4">4. Specialized Features For Specialized Fitness App</h2>



<p>Whenever you are thinking about how to make your own fitness app, you need to consider some specialized features besides the MVP features, your app needs some specialized features based on its type to create fitness app.</p>



<p>These features are specific features for the different kinds of fitness apps we have already listed above. So let&#8217;s take a detailed look at what kind of special features you can add to your fitness app, based on its type.</p>



<p>So no matter what kind of fitness app you are planning on making, follow this list of specialized features to give the users a specialized experience.</p>

<h4>Guided Meditation</h4>



<p>Meditation is an important way of getting the mind in a healthy place. So it is obvious that your app needs to have a meditation feature. But at the same time, not everyone who is going to use your app is going to know how to meditate. So you need a guided meditation feature for the app.</p>



<p>The guided meditation feature is not only going to help the user learn how to meditate but also teach them breathing exercises, mindfulness and train their mind to stay calm even in the worst of all situations.</p>



<h4>Short Meditation Session</h4>

<h2 id="step5">5. Tech Stack &#8211; Let&#8217;s Get Technical</h2>



<p>When you think about how to make a fitness app, you have to think about the technical side of it as well. After you have made the important decisions about what type of app you want to make and what kind of MVP and specialized features you need for your fitness apps, you need to focus on the tech stack.</p>



<p>When it comes to the functionality of a fitness application, the tech stack is incredibly important. In this case, we can study one of the celebrities of the fitness app segment- Fitbit, and see what kind of tech stack they have implemented in their app.</p>



<ul>
<li>For application and data, they have used programming languages such as C, Java, Javascript, and HTML5.</li>
<li>For dedicated cloud hosting, Fitbit uses IBM SoftLayer, which is a public cloud computing platform.</li>
<li>And for the framework of the app, they use the Android SDK and Spring Framework.</li>
<li>For the API, Fitbit uses Runscope. It is a cloud-based and hybrid on-premise solution for the developers to test and debug the application APIs. In order to provide seamless user experience, Fitbit uses Fastly for its Content Delivery Network.</li>
<li>For code collaboration, Fitbit developers have used Github, and for performance monitoring New Relic. Along with these, they have used <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/" target="_blank">Pingdom </a>for website monitoring and <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/" target="_blank">PagerDuty </a>for monitoring aggregation.</li>
<li>For issue tracking the developers have user JIRA and for project management Confluence. For group chat purpose, they have used HipChat and for help desk, the developers have integrated the use of Desk.com.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, when you make your own fitness app, make sure to integrate ads that are relevant to health and fitness app development. These ads should be about sportswear and nutritional foods etc. just make sure you don’t lose users because of ads.</p>



<h3>A One Time Fee, Or Make It Monthly</h3>



<p>Subscriptions are the second universal way of making money with apps.</p>



<p>When you make a fitness app for your business, you can integrate multiple subscription plans to make money from the users. The basic subscription plans can be a monthly or yearly basis, which means the users would have to pay a monthly fee every month to use special features on the fitness app or pay a fee once every year.</p>



<p>The other plans can be a quarterly fee paid every three months. Including multiple subscription plans will make sure that the users can subscribe to it using a convenient plan for them.</p>



<h3>The Paid Features</h3>

<p>Secondly, you can promote any kind of fitness related products, and get paid a fee when the app user makes a purchase of the promoted product based on your app’s advice.</p>



<p>Sponsorships are an amazing way of monetizing your fitness app. Because not only you are going to make money with it, but you are also going to get the exposer you need to increase your userbase.</p>

<h2 id="step7">7. Choose The Right Fitness App Development Partner</h2>



<p>Now that you have found out almost everything about the fitness app, it’s time to figure out how you are going to pick the right partner for your app development process. Chances are that you yourself are not very familiar with the extremely technical side of the app development process such as coding and design and whatnot. And even if you are, you will still need help to create a robust fitness app. </p>



<p>So how are you going to pick the right partner for the development process? Here are a few criteria.</p>



<ul>
<li>Work Portfolio</li>
</ul>



<p>The first and foremost thing to check out when choosing the right health and fitness app developer as your development partner is to check out their work portfolio. This way you would get a glimpse at the kind of work they have already done and if it is relevant to your project. Once you have an idea of their capabilities it will be easier for you to make the decision.</p>



<ul>
<li>Client References</li>
</ul>



<p>Client references are a big thing when it comes to choosing the right fitness app development partner. If they have already done works related to fitness apps, then the client references can help you understand whether they can do a competent job or not. Not just that, client references and reviews stand as a testimony to the skills and expertise of the app developer. </p>



<ul>
<li>Will They Add Value To Your App?</li>
</ul>



<p>App development is not a blind job. The developer has to add value to your app as well, a value that might not have been there when you first started planning the app. The skills and expertise of the developer are going to add unique value to your app that is going to make it unique. So before you pick your app development partner for your fitness and health app, make sure that they will add unique value to your app. </p>



<ul>
<li>The Technical Skills Of The Developer Team</li>
</ul>



<p>Since fitness apps themselves can be quite technical to develop, choosing a team that is skilled in the technical aspects of app development is going to be better for your app. Here you can once again fall back onto client reviews and see what is being said about the potential team’s technical skills. </p>



<p>It may take more than this to choose the right partner for your health and fitness app development. But at the end of the day, the above-mentioned factors are the most important in choosing the right app development partner for your app. So, what&#8217;s your take?</p>



<h2>The Bottomline</h2>



<p>A fit person leads a better life. This is the motto for people everywhere today. And keeping up with this value, the fitness app sector is getting more and more popular every day.</p>



<p>Which is why this is the perfect time for you to think about how to make a fitness app, and enter the market with your unique idea.</p>

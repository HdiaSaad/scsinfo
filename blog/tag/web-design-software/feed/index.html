										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Awestruck designs, user-friendly browsing, responsive architecture attracted you towards the website, but do you know the names of the web designers who designed such a great website???</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, you must recognize the men behind such good approaches &#8211; it is the web designers and the developers making websites feasible across cross-platforms. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">Web designing</a> is a tough task and having access to the right tool can make a website look compact and browser savvy. Therefore, what are those tools that can help web developers design a great website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We wrapped up a post where we are going to share 20 essential design tools that every web designer’s toolkit must possess. Just as we said, this is the list of essential design tools, well not necessarily applicable for everyday use, but these tools can save time. These time-clutter tools will help designers and developer to overcome difficulties in the process of development across cross-browser applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">20 web-design and front end development tools in one list…phew, that can bore you, so we though to keep it short and engaging by separating the content in Part-I &amp; Part-II. So, let us go for the Part-I –</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fontello</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Need to generate icons, then this tool can help to customize designs according to website demands. A free of cost tool carries necessary icons for making responsive websites. However, WordPress users will find it easier to work with pre-installed plugins, but for front-end developers this is a perfect resource.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>MockingBirdMockup Tool</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just as another wireframe tool to make house or interior designs. It has many icons on their left side panel, which developers can easily add by dragging and dropping. The icons relate to forms, images, videos etc.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gratisography</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you prefer to use ultra high-quality pictures for websites, and do not know the right place to get them, then look up for Gratisography. It has plenty of images to browse, and you can do whatever you like. Well, it does not have a category order, but then again you are not going to use these for important projects.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bugherd</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make the websites go bug free with well-structured way of feedback handling, and error fixing, without the interruption of the email.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Foundation 5</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Best prototype tool for web application that includes guides about how to deal with the latest web issues. The latest release of Foundation 5 includes help for SASS CSS preprocessor. Therefore, if you develop a website with latest CSS trends, this is the ultimate best.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dabblet</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Open source web tool that helps to check and test HTML/CSS snippets in real time. Dabblet works comfortably with all modern browsers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Brackets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A great editor tool loaded with some powerful functions such as browser reloading, CSS syntax checking, error handling and function searching. It boosts the development work effectively.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FlatUI Colors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quit the use of same colors; better grab Flat UI type of colors from the website when you work with Flat designs. Just clikc on any of the color and grab the code, you can switch between the output formats &#8211; HEX, RGB, etc</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Subtle Patterns</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Definitely, a great tool to get some cool background patterns. At present, there are about 400 patterns, free to download and can preview it on the page itself.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Meet The Ipsums</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Look for more choices of online Lorem Ipsum styles at this website. It is more like a novelty, but we should respect our individual needs. Replace that old Meow Ipsum instead of the standard one, it is refreshing.</p>

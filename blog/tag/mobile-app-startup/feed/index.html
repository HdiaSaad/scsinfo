										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From a basic communication device to using it as a virtual reality device, there are merely any functions left behind by mobile technology. By introducing extended capabilities, it has helped mankind to witness the technological upsurge in a rapid phase, but what lies next? Is there something more in store? Will mobile technology amaze us with new discoveries? Such questions are bound to come in our minds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout this blog, we will share with you the upcoming changes which you are all set to witness in the field of <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a> and how will mobile technology shape up the world in the years to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s put an end to all your curiosity and present to you the future of mobile technology which we and the coming generation are going to witness.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‘Augmented Reality’ Close To Reality</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Virtual Reality is making news everywhere, Augmented Reality is the next one in the line. Using the GPS on your smartphone to find the nearest restaurant or places of interest is a cliché now. Augmented Reality will enable users to find them offline just by activating their camera. Yes, this is going to be this easy. In the next few years, this feature will undergo many new transformations to give the user more relevant search results. Combining computer data and fetching it to the users in real time will be a challenging task, though, but nevertheless, it will pave the way for mobile app development.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Foldable Flexible Screens</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tired of carrying your large screen Smartphones everywhere? Why not fold it? Yes, the dream of carrying that large screen smartphone will finally come true as foldable screens will come in the near future to make your phone pocket-friendly. The Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) technology will make this possible. This means you can view from both sides of the phone and perform dual activities from both sides. If accepted well, by the masses, it can further evolve into a wearable device. Imagine you are wearing your smartphone on your wrist. An interesting concept. Isn’t it?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advanced Voice Control</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The voice recognition system will now be at its best. Many researches have been done in order to develop the quality of voice, but time and again it has proved to be a hectic task. Just as Siri introduced the system of voice recognition by interpreting the diction and syntax of the speech, in the same way, use of a natural user interface at a more advanced level will overtake the current way of communication. Seamless voice control will emerge as the next voice control app. Such kind of feature will increase the interactivity as far as Smartphones are concerned. Thus, this mobile technology will certainly prove to be the best.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Moving Beyond 3D Screens</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Apple has raised the bar with retina display, the introduction of 3D screens have brought forward crystal clear screen display by enabling the user to view from three dimensions. The more advanced level of viewing experience beyond 3D could be the use of holograms. This could totally change our viewing experience in a smartphone. Integrating the movements along with the 3D displays will allow you to compress or adjust the size of your pictures just with the help of a single touch.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What To Expect From Android In The Future ?</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than half of the mobile population around the world makes use of Android Smartphones.</p>
<h3><strong>1. An All New Google Map</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can expect a much more sophisticated version of the Google Maps with helpful features. Google is already in talks for hiring the street view cameras so that it can allow the users to get a clear inside view of a building or a monument. Detailing will be the primary focus of the app.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. More Secured Payments </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though many secured methods for payments have been adopted such as OTP and an SSL payment gateway, but in the near future, it is all set to get complicated, so that transaction becomes much easier. Fingerprint recognition and iris scanning can be the next process of payment.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Innovation In Hardware</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There could be a complete change in the hardware of your smartphone. As discussed in this blog earlier, that one could also see a foldable screen in the future. In future, Smartphones could be the new wearables and will completely change the way we communicate with a mobile.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What To Expect From iOS In The Future?</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the Worldwide Developer’s Conference, 2016, Tim Cook announced a number of technological upgrades apart from releasing iOS10.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Upgraded iMessaging </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the recently released version of iOS10, one can reply to a message instantly on receiving the notifications. In the near future, the focus of Apple will be to extend the concept of messaging to third parties. Moreover, the secondary focus will be mainly on increasing the font size and creating bigger emoticons.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Improving the User Interface</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In each version, Apple has upgraded its user interface, but what holds in the near future is really a matter of curiosity for iPhone lovers. Shifting to OLED screens is an indication that can change the user interface that Apple has been maintaining all the while. As a result, the user can benefit from saving the battery even in dark mode.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Richer Notifications  </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apple has taken a significant leap as far as adjusting the notifications are concerned. Media rich notifications will be the key agenda and no application will be required to open in order to view the notifications box. This up gradation will pull the user more towards installing the application.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Transformation For Business </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the years to come, mobile technology will have a transformational effect on the business. Starting from IT to marketing and corporate sector, it will have a chain of effects and will drastically change the way we work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rise Of The Virtual Office</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By 2020, it is expected that one doesn’t need to be physically present at the workstation. Digital space will overtake the cabins and desks. With the rapid evolution of video calls, messaging and email, business houses need to strategize in the most calculative manner in order to get the work done.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mobile Tech To Become A Real Player</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, most of the people around the world depend on a smartphone rather than on his laptop or computer. With the massive mobile user around the world, there is no doubt that in future, people are mostly going to use their mobile for all kinds of official work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ERP Systems To Rise</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The need to real time availability of business reports and data is becoming the need of the hour in this era of competitive business development. Everything must be at your fingertips every time. With the introduction of ERP, you will have access to custom reports from anywhere. Hence, this will ease the process of business development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile devices have revolutionized our life since their advent and it will continue to amaze us with their amazing impact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The mobile application industry is driven today by the need for big data, business intelligence, and analytics. The more tactical and strategic the app will be, the more will be its demand in the market. With rapid advancements made every day, it is quite evident that there will be more demand for such apps in the time to come. In order to live up to the growing demands of mobile application around the world, there is no wonder about the fact that many entrepreneurs are coming up across the world by setting up their own mobile app startup.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a budding entrepreneur, who is planning to start his or her own enterprise that makes a mobile app, then we are here to help you out with some basic things, which you must know and be aware of, once you start the business. At the end of this blog, you will come to know about the what, when and how facts, related to a startup of a <a title="mobile app development company" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target="_blank">mobile app development company</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, let us take a look at the various factors which you’ll have to take into account when you are all set to launch your mobile app business.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Difference Between Native And Cross Platform</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It depends on you which platform do you want to develop the app. Remember that whatever platform you choose has got its own set of coding rules. For an iOS app, the platform will be Objective – C, whereas for android app development, the platform will either be Java or HTML. If you are doing it for the first time, then it is recommended that you start testing it on a single platform. As far as multi- platform development is concerned, you can start it later.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Proper Platform Selection</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember, you have App store, Google Play, and Windows store to upload your apps. So, it depends on you where do you want to see your apps. Apple always pays more to those who want their app to be downloaded by charging fees. If you want to upload it on Windows store, you might not be able to earn much revenue. Google Store can be the ultimate solution in this case and poses a challenge to iTunes. As a newbie in the market, it is recommended that you put your app for sale on the app store.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Create Flawless Designs</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Designing is not a rocket science or a big task as you always think it to be. Include pixel-perfect graphics for all the images to be used in your app, use big buttons and icons, test your design in multiple formats such as X HDMI, hope, dpi and make sure that your icons and fonts should always be big irrespective of the screen size. It is always a wise decision to hire an expert designer first and then decide the final icons or layout.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Secret to Retain Clients</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you are in the mobile app development business, the best way to retain your clients is to make simple applications. Refrain from including annoying pop-ups in between apps, or else, if you really want to include the ads then ask the permission of the users on the app description page itself. Keep updating your app after taking feedback from them about the app. The last thing to remember is to keep the process of login as easier as you can. Even a simple Facebook login can be of help.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Apply Clever Marketing Strategies</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to marketing, use the four weapons of product description, brand awareness, SEO and intelligence gathering. Instead of simply writing about your app, write a persuasive sales letter that will pique interest among the readers. As far as intelligence gathering is concerned, follow what your competitors are doing. Promote your mobile app by sharing it on social media platforms as a brand. Try to provide as many backlinks as possible for your app.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Monetize Your App</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now there are three ways to monetize your app – sell the USP of your app, give it for free download or sell it in an app store at a fixed price. Another interesting way might be to have two versions of the app which are the pro version and the free version. You can charge for the pro version and allow the other version for a free download.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Factors That Could Pose As A Hindrance</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since you are starting out your venture for the first time, you might make some mistakes, which can cost you dollars. We present to you some of the factors that could limit the growth of your mobile app startup.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Authenticating A Mobile App With Mobile Web</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the entrepreneurs who are new in the mobile app industry often make the mistake of authenticating a mobile application through mobile web. It is important to understand here that the speed and functionality of the mobile app are impossible to match with a mobile web. One may find a mobile website while browsing through the Google search results, but a mobile app is confined only within the walls of Windows, Android, and iOS. Hence using a mobile app through a mobile web will give you wrong data.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ignoring The Core Features In The First Version</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Merely including a handful of features in an app is not something that people would expect from an app. What the user is really concerned about is to the extent to which the app solves the problem. The core feature of your app should always focus on solving the problem of the user. Once you are able to incorporate that it will become easier for you to sell your app.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing Cross Platform</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is no doubt one of the best platforms for developing an application, but if you use such technologies then the most important thing which you will miss is the satisfaction in user experience. It is important to understand that there lies a difference in developing an app using one&#8217;s own platform and using a third-party app. Moreover, when you are developing a mobile app on your own platform, you can independently rely on the developers to fix any issues or bugs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>To Sum It Up…</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting a mobile app business is not a risky affair at all, but at the same time, you have to keep in mind not only about the budget but develop the app that solves the problems of the user who is going to make use of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Hope</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Smiles from the threshold of the year to come,</em></p>
<p>Whispering &#8216;it will be happier”<br />
<em>&#8211; Alfred Tennyson</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2016, UIPL is going to witness a new dawn with the arrival of another year and open a new chapter in website designing and development, similar to the quote mentioned-above by the famous American poet, Alfred Tennyson.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2015 was a wonderful year for us and in order to make it more productive and continue to be on the growth trajectory in the coming year, we have chalked out some plans, which will be our sketch map towards becoming the best <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>website design and development company</strong></a>. It has been our constant endeavor to empower the imaginations by offering creative and innovative app and website development services. <b> </b>So, we share with you, our vision for 2016 in website designing and development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>a) </strong><b>Sketch App For Creative and Interactive User Interface</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are planning to introduce Sketch while designing the user interface whether it is about designing low fidelity wireframes or designing an icon and high fidelity mockups. This app might help our designers to design the vector elements while working on a variety of interfaces. With some similar features from the Photoshop such as layer styles and text effects, the app won’t pose many problems as far as its usability is concerned, but at the same time is expected to simplify the work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>b) </strong><b>Browser-Based IDEs to replace Desktop IDE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have plans to introduce browser-based IDEs to simplify the process of writing codes. A browser-based IDE gives coding suggestions as well as the option of syntax highlighting in comparison to a desktop IDE that is only limited to Xcode and Notepad++.With the help of cloud-based browser IDEs, it might become easy for our developers to write code from any computer even without an internet connection. One of the browser-based IDEs is CodePen, which comes loaded with customized pre processors like LESS/SCSS and Jade/Haml.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>c) </strong><b>Card Layouts Format For Websites</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to manage those web pages that are filled with more and more content, we intend to follow the card layout format. It enables the visitors coming to the website to scan the content easily. For instance: You might have noticed that the home page of Google Now is based upon the card layout structure in order to leave space for the Google Now apps. By providing more dynamic grids to a website page, a card layout helps to put more emphasis on the content.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>d) </strong><b>Video Tutorials Are An Easy Way To Learn. Isn’t it, so why not do it?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are planning to upload videos in our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, in order to give a better understanding of the products and services we offer to our clients. To a layman, it might become difficult to understand a technical term used in the app making process. We will post videos related to mobile app development, <a href="https://unifiedinfotech.wordpress.com/2015/10/26/hey-thats-a-wrong-way-to-put-up-responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">website designing</a> and development so that it becomes easier for the customer to get a hands-on experience of the way we develop an app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>e) </strong><b>No Need To Learn A New Programming Language, Native JS Mobile Apps Are There</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We use Java for Android and Objective – C or Swift for iOS in order to develop the apps, but sometimes a need might arise from the client’s side to make use of a new language while making a mobile app. If this type of situation arises, we can make use of Native JS apps in order to help the developers built a mobile app according to the requirement of clients and without learning a new language. A number of native apps are available in the market these days such as <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank">ReactNative</a> or <a href="https://nativescript.org/" target="_blank">NativeScript</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>f) </strong><b>UX Design For Better Information Architecture</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make the user experience, even more wonderful we want to introduce UX designs and implement it across all platforms of digital interfaces. With the help of UX design, we will improve the information architecture and interactive designs. One of the most important benefits which we will derive by introducing UX design is that we will be able to determine that our products have all those features which our target audience are looking for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>g) </strong><b>A Little Motion with Cinemagraphs For Your Web Pages</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping in mind about the latest trends in web page designing, we plan to include cinemagraphs in the web pages as it gives a livelier experience to the visitors. How many times did you come across a website that has a little motion in its images? Well, the trend of using cinemagraphs in a website is on the rise and hence, we will design the web pages keeping in mind about the importance of cinemagraphs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>h) </strong><b>Introduce Server Side JavaScript</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Node.js is on the rise as far as the preferences of the developers are concerned. It helps to make a website with the help of one language, both at the front and backend, hence, we want to introduce this server side JavaScript in order to make website designing a fun experience. Most of the industry leaders are opting for server side languages when it comes to implementing the basic design of a website, hence we are ready to cater according to the client’s requirement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>i) </strong><b>No More Multiple Pop-ups</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The era of multiple pop-ups when multiple tabs used to open as soon as we used to click a website is over. Neither will we recommend to our clients nor will we implement it in our website. People want clean websites these days, which are clutter free and are free from any unnecessary advertisements, thus building a pop-up free website will be one of the main agendas in our vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our vision in 2016 is to attain the status of being the best website designing company in this era of technological development. We want to be on the growth path and witness success in every venture we undertake in the near future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UIPL family wishes everyone a Happy 2016. Have a wonderful year ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">CSS development tool one of the recent humdrum and not just fun, as it used to be. If that has been what you have found in the last little while, then it is a good idea to turn something new and fresh such as Rucksack. A neat and compact package full of goodies makes CSS development easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is both modular and quick as lightning. Rucksack built of PostCSS and come out with many full-fledged features. Designers and developers want to start using tools right out of the box, and in this case, we see that Rucksack will not disappoint us. It is easy to integrate it into their work without any hassle. Developers are going to find plugins that exist for the majority of build tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can integrate this Rucksack CSS development tool manually with npm module or process the CSS right into the command line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some of the features that developers might find interesting. Go through the features pointed by the team of developers at our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank">Web Design Services</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a complete modular tool and lets you turn their features on and off. You can also customize it to your taste. Simply pass on the feature name and a Boolean as soon as you initialize it in your build tool. All features can be set to true by default.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Responsive Typography</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can produce the “automagical” fluid typography thanks to a new, responsive property on the font size. You can get a start is as easy to specify responsive as font size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to exercise some control over the font size and you can change the default settings. The most efficient way is to achieve through new shorthand syntax in the font size as well as a new property called font range. The font range is able to identify the viewport width between the font size is fluid. Well, out of this range, the font size can be set against the minimum and maximum values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, it is possible to assign specific values like px, rem, and em with independent properties. Rucksack responsive typography output complicated calc- and VW-based font sizes. Along with the media queries, you can establish a range between font sizes that is fluid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shorthand Positioning</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the use of Rucksack, you will get along with shorthand methods to utilize it by properties such as padding and margin to position your offsets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Quantity Pseudo-Selectors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this CSS development tool that will add pseudo-selectors to allow you to pick and style elements as per their quantity. You can utilize them to create powerful, responsive and content-driven designs –</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. :at-least applies if there’s a specific number of items or more<br />
2. :at-most applies if there are a specific number of items or less<br />
3. :between applies to all items inside a specific range<br />
4. :exactly applies if there’s an exact number of items</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These quantity pseudo-selectors helps to style elements based on the sibling count.<br />
Property Aliases</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rucksack will allow you to set aliases for long property names and save excessive keystrokes. You just need to add it to the @alias rule in the format (alias): (property);. Well, you can utilize the aliases anywhere including other properties. It is better to have a single @alias rule in a project and specify all aliases in a place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Input Pseudo-Elements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rucksacks&#8217; pseudo-elements let you style efficiently the inner elements of HTML5 inputs across browsers. The range input (and the:: placeholder when you enable automatic vendor prefixing) is the only element to support. Yet you can add the extra when browser vendor allows access to their UPIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can style the placeholders with the use of the:: placeholder pseudo-element. You can apply this to any input element or at the style sheet’s roof for global styling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will find the range input difficult to style, so you can enable the use of:: track and:: thumb. You can apply these to any range of elements or at the style sheet’s root for global styling. You will come across the following declarations—WebKit appearance: none; and Moz-appearance: none. You can add relevant elements allowing the custom styles to apply correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Native Clearfix</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rucksack enables the common clear fix methods into native methods within the clear property. It defines itself as the method by which developers make a parent element self-clear so that floats remain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here you will find new two new methods to add &#8211; fix and fix legacy. You will get the same result, yet possess different degrees of browser support. You need to fix the output of the cleaner code that you will require for IE8.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Font src Expansion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rucksack offers a shortcut method to produce some of the bulletproof src set in @font-face. It includes a new font path and you need to set the path simply to the font files. This will create an src-set output based on the FontSpring syntax.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hex RGBA Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This CSS development tool offers a simple shortcut to add an alpha channel to a hex color. You need to add the hex value to convert it as a substitute to the RGB value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Easings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will find a slew of modern easing functions present on Rucksack. Designers and developers can use them both in CSS transitions and animations. Any number of new easing will allow us to translate to cubic-bezier () functions on output. You can natively comprehend it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Legacy Fallbacks</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Legacy support on Rucksack because of their easy provision of fallback comes with many properties on an older browser. You can use voluntary add-on that you can toggle on and off fallbacks. Opacity is also able to generate a suitable MS filter to accomplish transparency in IE8. RGBA is able to produce a hexadecimal fallback rgba () for</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automatic Prefixing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The developers can easily run the code through the suitable Autoprefixer, which automatically applies to a relevant vendor or you can run them as per current browser popularity and support.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to know more about how our developers are using it effectively, you need to look at <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/portfolio/" target="_blank">our recent works.</a></p>

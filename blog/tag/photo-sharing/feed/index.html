<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today social media is the baseline for the photo-sharing segment. Some of the popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are hotspots for photo sharing. </span></p>

As per </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/markets/424/topic/540/social-media-user-generated-content/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, social media is the most popular way of recreation and connectivity for the generation now. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram- The Ruling King Of Photosharing App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to photo sharing apps, Instagram is a household name. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2010, acquired by Facebook in 2012, Instagram is a name that everyone knows.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Success Story of Instagram</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram is an app that is basically a photo first. Which means, unlike Facebook, where you can share everything about your life, Instagram relies only on the photos you upload. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are thinking Instagram became this popular just cause everyone is sharing photos on it, you are partially right. It is also an excellent platform for business marketing and promotions. Having an account on Instagram means being able to reach it’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 billion users as of June 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wanna talk money, then we would tell you Instagram brought in $4 billion in revenue in 2017. This accounts for 20% of Facebook&#8217;s annual revenue. The number is supposed to swell to $10 billion by 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing from the business and marketing point, 60% of users stated that they learned about a certain product or service from Instagram</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in brief, why is Instagram becoming so popular now?</span></h3>

No matter what kind of business you have, you can utilize an Instagram account to increase your consumer base.

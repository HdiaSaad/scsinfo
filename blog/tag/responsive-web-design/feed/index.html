										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><i>“Design is the silent ambassador of your brand.” – Paul Rand</i></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The line by one of the most prominent graphic designers in the world is enough to explain why the link between branding and website design is so important to pay attention to when designing the online platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No matter what the organization does or what kind of landscape it caters to, creating a unique identity through design is an effective way of stealing inside people&#8217;s hearts and staying there for a longer time. Sure, you can use a lot of words to create an image. But words are easily forgotten. Visuals are not.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With that in mind, let&#8217;s delve deep into the process of web design branding and the best practices that will enhance the overall effect of branding efforts. But before that, let’s take a peek into all the matters we are going to cover with this article.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. Web Design Branding: What It Is &amp; Why Is This Necessary?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sites are the modern-day spokesperson for businesses. The online platforms are crafted to strengthen an entrepreneur&#8217;s existence on the internet and garner more and more clients. The importance of these platforms is growing, as an increasing number of people are turning to the internet to seek out relevant services they might need daily.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keeping that significance of the website in mind, it is only logical that you start branding the website design of the business platform. With a streamlined process, one can create, implement, and portray the perfect business personality and encourage growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What other reasons make this practice a necessity? Here’s a list with some examples.</p>
<h3>a. Improves Company Recognition</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Think about a popular brand, like Pepsi!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whenever someone says Pepsi, the one thing that we all think of is the iconic blue color of a Pepsi can. The color is an integral part of the brand that is Pepsi, and it is a visual that we all recognize (and maybe even love!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The color is so much a part of Pepsi&#8217;s brand design that the entire site is that same shade of blue. And it is one of the best visual branding practices one can ever find.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But what if the platform did not make use of that color?</p>
<figure id="attachment_13020" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13020" style="width: 1259px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13020 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pepsi-branding.png" alt="" width="1259" height="694" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pepsi-branding.png 1259w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pepsi-branding-300x165.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pepsi-branding-1024x564.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pepsi-branding-768x423.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1259px) 100vw, 1259px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13020" class="wp-caption-text">Source: pepsi.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">As we already mentioned above, audiences tend to forget words, but they remember visuals and how the services made them feel. And with that kind of dynamic in play, it makes sense that brand identity development on a website is one of the surest ways of being remembered by the audience, and therefore improve the company recognition.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Want to become one of the iconic brands? Recognize/create that one unique brand feature for the organization that is easy to understand, makes people feel good, and implement that in a visually pleasing way throughout the site.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>b. Helps With Consistency Of Branding Practice</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Branding is not merely visuals! It’s a lot more than that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Design and branding strategy is all about the organization’s vows, its values, and how it is delivered through all the services. And when the site does not reflect that sentiment, it creates a gap in the branding efforts. And a gap like that is going to make it hard to gain buyer trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the best examples of consistent branding can be seen on the site of Trello. A collaboration tool that is well known for streamlining teamwork through digital Kanban-like boards, Trello’s site design reflects that promise of ease and simplicity well enough.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13021" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13021" style="width: 1263px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13021 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trello-branding.png" alt="" width="1263" height="699" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trello-branding.png 1263w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trello-branding-300x166.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trello-branding-1024x567.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/trello-branding-768x425.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1263px) 100vw, 1263px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13021" class="wp-caption-text">Source: trello.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Expanding the corporate brand identity design to the site is going to provide the visitants with a seamless experience that will become the ultimate trademark for the brand. If the site experience doesn’t match up to organization claims, then the branding efforts will be meaningless.</p>

<h3>c. Keep The Employees Inspired</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">When speaking about branding benefits, most people talk about customers. But what about the employees?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good brand design </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the in-house experts of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Casablanca User Experience Agencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that outlines the visions &amp; values of the establishment clearly, gives the staff a bigger purpose to work towards and helps to stay invigorated. Without this bigger plan to serve, the work efforts put in by the workers will be dispassionate at best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Think about a brand like Microsoft- the branding efforts have always been symmetrical with the kind of services the organization provides. And the organization&#8217;s overarching purpose keeps the workers encouraged to do better constantly.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13022" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13022" style="width: 1226px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13022 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-content-branding.png" alt="" width="1226" height="482" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-content-branding.png 1226w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-content-branding-300x118.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-content-branding-1024x403.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/microsoft-content-branding-768x302.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1226px) 100vw, 1226px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13022" class="wp-caption-text">Source: microsoft.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">And this happens to be one of the many reasons why web design branding is imperative to reach the top of the market. Simply wanting to advance the business will not encourage the workers to perform well. Providing a brand goal through enterprise vision and letting the site design reflect that will be one of the ultimate ways to keep the in-house staff invigorated.</p>
<h3>d. Attracts More Customers</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Acquiring new consumers is a different challenge compared to retaining them. It is a widely known fact that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/09/12/dont-spend-5-times-more-attracting-new-customers-nurture-the-existing-ones/?sh=b98929e5a8e0">it takes five times more effort to gain new consumers than it takes to retain one</a>. And most of this leviathan effort can be executed through the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The difference between retaining and acquiring goes something like this- a person who has already obtained a service, and was provided with a satisfying aid (regardless of the site design/brand positioning) would be more likely to contact the same provider again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But a person unaware of an organization would like to size it up first. This includes complete online research about the organization, testimonials, and a thorough examination of whether the services and brand value match with specific user goals. The visitor will decide once the results come out to be satisfactory.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And to sway user decisions, one has to know how to design a brand and imbibe it within the site. All because the site becomes the first thing the audience encounters, and without expressing the brand image on the site, there is a chance to either mislead or lose the visitors to a competitor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are more reasons why visual identity development is crucial for business sites. But the above mentioned happen to be some of the more prominent ones that drive <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">web design companies</a> to utilize the site to integrate the brand as well. Now let&#8217;s talk about the process our in-house experts at SCS INFO swear by when it comes to creating a brand on site.</p>

<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. How To Design A Brand On The Website?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">What does it take to develop a brand?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, even now, this specific practice is considered to be all about visual elements, therefore a lot of online resources talk about the relationship between colors, logo, and brand design, as well as animations and whatnots. But in reality, the matter goes a lot deeper than that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So let&#8217;s take a look at our in-house four-part procedure of branding through the site. This exclusive peek will help to understand how to build a perfect brand image on the site to impress the visitants and establish market authority.</p>
<h3>a. Build Your Story From Ground Up</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The story is a necessary element to start creating a brand on the site. But why is that?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A story involves characters, conflicts, and resolution. And a rich story of the organization’s journey from the very beginning to the present point is significant in touching the heart of the visitants, engaging them, and convincing them that through all the hardships, the enterprise has earned the right kind of experience needed to fulfill specific user demands.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Without a story, the brand identity on the website design is going to be just a glorious pitch to the consumers, full of words that might be true on the enterprise end, but fail to convince even the most easily swayed people out there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, when building the story, there are a few things to keep in mind-</p>
<h3>b. Introduce A Meaningful Narrative</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The consumers won’t be interested in what you do and how you do it unless you don’t start with why you do it!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When acquiring a solution or a product, the user has a set objective. And a misalignment between the user and service provider purposes can cause the business great harm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that&#8217;s why as a seasoned brand design company, we always start the process with a relevant narrative. This story explains to the visitants why the organization provides the specific service and begins the relationship with target clients on a note of mutual understanding.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">

</div>
</div>
<h3>c. Keep The Story Short &amp; Sweet</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">If the brand narrative goes like this below image, then it is time for some heavy editing.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13028" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13028" style="width: 830px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13028 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/clapham-junction-keep-story-short-and-sweet.png" alt="" width="830" height="467" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/clapham-junction-keep-story-short-and-sweet.png 830w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/clapham-junction-keep-story-short-and-sweet-300x169.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/clapham-junction-keep-story-short-and-sweet-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13028" class="wp-caption-text">Source: itv.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">A story that goes on and on with millions of twists and turns is not ideal for web design branding. To engage the audience right from the beginning, the story needs to be succinct. And to do so, the narrative should focus on these specific parts-</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">How the organization started?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The mission statement</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Why is the organization different &amp; better than the competitors?</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keeping the narrative limited to these three main elements will be enough. But a bland exhibition can hurt engagement. And that&#8217;s why skilled brand design companies put so much concentration on making the basic facts engaging.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. Provide Contrast To Stand Out</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stories in this world are not that different from one another. And the best way you can make your brand design story different than the rest out there is by providing contrast.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13035 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-providing-a-contrast-to-narrative-point.jpg" alt="" width="825" height="854" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-providing-a-contrast-to-narrative-point.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-providing-a-contrast-to-narrative-point-290x300.jpg 290w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-providing-a-contrast-to-narrative-point-768x795.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What’s a contrast though?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Contrast is all about what makes your organization different from the others out there. The element that provides a contrast to your brand story can be your unique value proposition, new kind of business planning, or an innovative user experience on the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As long as you express clearly how your service is different and irreplaceable compared to others out there, you can provide the much-needed contrast and establish your corporate brand identity strongly in the market.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. Telling The Story Clearly</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once the story is built one needs to focus on web design branding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content is essential for a proper connection between the website story and the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">audience. And brand design firms utilize the site content to implement the narrative on the site. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Casablanca Digital Agencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acknowledge the pivotal role played by content in the site-narrative roadmap. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But how to ensure that the content is telling the story perfectly?</p>
<h3>a. Craft A Hierarchy That Makes Sense</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">First things first, an information hierarchy is needed to ensure the story structure makes sense.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This detail on the site can differ depending on the type of industry and audience. So before starting the implementation of that ideal story and brand identity development on the site, investigate a bit more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this situation consulting with an experienced web design agency will provide a better insight into the appropriate structure needed to match the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/benefits-of-mental-models-in-ux-design/">mental models of specific users</a>. We also ensure that this information is included within the brand guidelines for the design for future reference.</p>
<h3>b. Determine The Voice Of The Brand</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A story told blandly will do little to hold the attention of the audience. And when it comes to creating a brand for small businesses, experts are careful about the voice and tone used throughout the content.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13036 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-setting-a-tone-and-voice-for-web-content-point.jpg" alt="" width="825" height="528" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-setting-a-tone-and-voice-for-web-content-point.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-setting-a-tone-and-voice-for-web-content-point-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-setting-a-tone-and-voice-for-web-content-point-768x492.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Setting the mood of the narrative is all about how the audience will perceive the brand. Once again, determining the content tone can be tricky, but simple audience research can solve the problem without any hassle.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Expert speaks</strong>: According to our in-house design experts, the perfect content is genuine, focused on the consumers, and simple to understand. As long as the content has these three qualities, it will be a success no matter what kind of tone is used!</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>c. Three Musketeers Of Perfect Content- Original, Short &amp; Engaging</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once the voice is defined, it is time to ensure the content fulfills its designated purposes. And to do so, it is crucial to pay attention to three factors of content design and branding strategy-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Great content is always original. In this age of advanced piracy checks and strict Google ranking rules, no one can get away with copied content on the site. This is why to ensure the integrity of the narrative, we keep the content (both text &amp; images) as original as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Besides the originality, the content needs to be short. We have already discussed how significant it is to keep the brand story short, and that rule applies to the content as well. The impact of too long content will be incredibly harmful to the business as well as the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And lastly, we don&#8217;t just tell a story. With the use of necessary engaging elements such as proper brand architecture design, we ensure that the content delights the visitors and leaves a positive impact so that users keep coming back to the site.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Team SCS INFO helped transform their old website into a brand new business-boosting platform. And while doing that, we made sure that the site content was smart, snappy, and relatable to the target audience.</p>
<h3>d. Update The Content Regularly</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Popular sites content that triumphantly tells the brand narrative, as well as drive business for the organization, are always updated, fresh, and recent. And these updates are made according to changes in business plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consulting with an experienced website design company and updating the content based on the current changes in the company and the target user demands is the surefire way to keep the branding practices consistent on the site. So don’t forget the importance of such a matter and ensure that the content of the site is updated accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. Embellish The Narrative With Visuals</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">We believe that telling an engaging brand narrative is easier with the added visual components.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Be it the images and videos on the platform or the color schemes and logo- all this helps to make the content a lot more entertaining to look at and digest. Remember that the modern audience doesn&#8217;t have a lot of time to read an entire page. And that’s why visual details have become necessary to brand the site and engage the right kind of visitants.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s see how expert web design agencies utilize visual details that will enrich the branding efforts on the site-</p>
<h3>a. Choosing The Right Scheme Of Color</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"> A simple thing such as a color serves a lot of purpose on the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is not a superficial detail. The color scheme is supposed to express the primary thing you want the site users to feel. Depending on various factors, such as cultural, geographical, and different segments of the clients, this essential part of the brand guidelines design will make the users feel different things.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is why when deciding on the color palette for the site, we begin with a complete analysis of the demographic and the kind of visual requirements it has. Based on different factors we choose an arrangement that is visually pleasing as well as fulfills the brand goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Expert speaks</i><i>: According to our in-house designers, color plays a big role in making that first impression on the visitants. And that&#8217;s why choosing the right colors is just as important as any other part of the process. </i><i> </i></p>
<h3>b. Logo: The Branding Necessity</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The relationship between the logo and brand design is undeniably significant. The logo is an essential component that signifies the identity of the organization. The perfect logo grabs the audience’s attention within moments, as well as expresses market authority.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13034 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-the-logo-point.jpg" alt="" width="825" height="528" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-the-logo-point.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-the-logo-point-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/For-the-logo-point-768x492.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>c. Express The Story Better With Images &amp; Videos</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Visitors today don&#8217;t have the time to read through the entire website. And that&#8217;s why using too much text will be an irrelevant practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But how to design a brand image without a lot of content?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, the best way to ensure that the brand narrative is expressed perfectly without having to include long content is through the proper implementation of multimedia content. The easy to consume images and videos will make the site experience more enjoyable, as well as communicate the brand value to the audience.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13033" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13033" style="width: 1226px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13033 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unified-infotech.jpg" alt="" width="1226" height="514" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unified-infotech.jpg 1226w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unified-infotech-300x126.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unified-infotech-1024x429.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unified-infotech-768x322.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1226px) 100vw, 1226px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13033" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, there are some rules for adding images and videos on the screen that our experts always adhere to, and we are going to share it with you-</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>
<h4>Don’t Add The Image Above The Fold</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">The fold is the screen real estate that is noticeable without scrolling. It is the first thing the visitant will see when they land on the site, and that&#8217;s why we ensure that no big images are blocking the precious area and taking away that chance at making that stellar first impression.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Pro Tip: Still want to have an image above the fold? We suggest using a hero image. With this, you can add a background hero image that will help to set the atmosphere of the website.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>
<h4>Compress The Visual Content</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Images and videos are notorious for slowing down sites. And that&#8217;s why we always compress all multimedia content on the sites so that the site experience stays fast and smooth.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. Delight The Audience With  Micro-Interactions</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The purpose of the site is not only to inform the visitors but engage and entertain them. And when it comes to delighting the users, there’s no match to micro-interactions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These small trigger-based details can have a very positive impact on the site experience. Web design and branding services use these components to elevate the mundane site experience and make it entertaining; whether it is a screen loading simulations or a simple mouse hover animatronics, the small details can enhance the entire experience and make your brand stand out more.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Micro-interactions are cool, but don’t overdo them! Adding too many of such small animations can take away the novelty factor, rendering the whole thing quite useless.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: left;">5. Improve The Brand Impact With UI/UX</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lastly, we have arrived at the UI/UX factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In recent times we have all been aware of how important UI/UX aspects are to drive site engagement up. The proper implementation of UI/UX can also be elemental to boost business growth and increase leads through the site. But its effect on web design branding is too significant to ignore.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No one can completely control how a site visitor feels about the brand, but with the right kind of UI/UX implementation, it is possible to positively influence their thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some touchstones of UI/UX design our in-house experts think are mandatory to ensure the impact of the site on the users is a positive one-</p>
<h3>a. For A Seamless Experience Go Responsive</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Modern audiences are using different kinds of devices to access the site and conduct research. And that is why it is important to keep the matter of responsiveness in mind when designing the UI.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that the web design agency you’ve hired for design and branding purposes is experienced in creating responsive sites. With a responsive approach, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Casablanca Website Design Agencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it will be easy to provide a wholesome experience to the users who can enjoy the site whenever, wherever.</span></p>

<h3>b. Let The Site UI/UX Reflect Brand Values</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The site UI/UX is the perfect way of ensuring that the brand value is embedded into the customer experience. And that&#8217;s why we implement elements that reflect the specific values and mission of the client brand and let the consistent UI/UX express the brand value to the visitors.</p>
<h3>c. Keep Interactions Simple &amp; Transparent</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">While crafting the brand architecture design, you also need to focus on keeping the navigation simple and easy to understand. Too complicated navigational design on the site will discourage users from further exploration and all the branding efforts will go to waste.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And there it is, the complete four-step way of building a brand through site design. It is a cohesive and all-encompassing process that covers the entirety of the brand storytelling and enhances all the efforts of building a brand through the site design.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">With A Branded Website, Business Success Is Only A Few Steps Away</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Web design branding is not just about the visual elements rather it is about telling a story in the most visual way possible. And to accomplish that successfully, the right design and branding strategy is necessary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you’ve just launched a brand new website for your business and expecting loads of online clients. All in all, you’re very excited!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even after enough time, there is no business from your website. There are no clients coming in, and the bounce rate is sky-high even after trying out all the web page tricks. And you kind of feel like a kid being handed socks as presents on Christmas morning…</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/l41YzNlhKqyJqQZG0" width="298" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, before you compile the best in class strategists to find out where you went wrong with the website strategy, hear us out&#8212; it’s probably the design that crushed all your dreams of getting high numbers of clients from the website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might seem fake, but it’s true. When browsing for any product, most site visitors are going to check out the design of your website before they check the content to determine if your product is credible enough. If you can’t impress them with the design then forget about impressing them with the content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what should you do in this situation? Well, the most obvious solution is the website redesign. Partially or completely overhauling the website design to make it user-friendly can go a long way to ensure the success of the website. Now if you are thinking about how to redesign a website, then you’re at the right place, cause we are going to tell you about all the steps you need to follow to redesign your website for better.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Steps To Be Taken: For The Redesigning Of Your Website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we dive into the details on how to redesign your website to answer all your web redesign questions, let’s have a quick look at all the steps you need to take to redesign your website-</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have the web redesign checklist, let’s go through them and see what they entail.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step By Step Process Of Redesigning Your Personal Website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of redesigning your personal website is pretty simple. It’s all about recognizing the problem areas of the design of your website and then designing them again to match the requirements of your business. </span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eTpesGfqObU" width="727" height="409" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, before you hire website redesign services, you have to understand the steps, and below, we have discussed each of them in detail. </span></p>
<h2 id="Analyze_your_old_website_design"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Before Changing The Old, Let’s Analyze It</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you begin the website redesign process, stop and look at the already established design you have on your website. This will help you to design the website design strategy template to draw up the web redesign proposal. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11556 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Polaroid_Website.png" alt="analyzing before you find out how to redesign a website" width="610" height="555" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Polaroid_Website.png 610w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Polaroid_Website-300x273.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important for you to analyze the old design because you have to circle out the flaws of the old design to change them. Redesigning the website without analyzing the old design will only create more problems. Before understanding the website redesign requirements, you have to understand why you need redesign in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are asking why to redesign a website, then you need to analyze the old design of the text. Pretty sure you will find many reasons to redesign your website Here are a few of those reasons-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: The Design Is Ages Old</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first reason why you would need to redesign your website is the age of the design. We all know that fine wine is something that ages well, sadly it is not the same when it comes to website design. The design of a website needs to be updated with time, adapting to the latest design trends and techniques. Failing to do so will make your website look positively medieval, and that is not going to be appealing to the website visitors. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B: Designing Better UX</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second reason why you might have to redesign your website is to give the users a better UX. if the UX of the website is not up to par, you might receive complaints, or maybe have the bounce rate speak on behalf of the users. In any case, designing a better UX can be one of the main reasons why you might find yourself having to go through the web revamp process. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C: Integration Of Latest Tools</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology is advancing by the minutes. And that’s why we have more tools available for website designing today than we had last year. And it goes without saying that to leverage the best of these tools, you have to redesign your website to match their technical requirements. </span></p>
<h2 id="Find_ELTWO"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Finding ELTWO: Elements That Work</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because your website needs redesigning, does not mean everything needs to be changed. In fact, you will find that many aspects of your website work perfectly fine. And if they do work fine, then there’s no need for any web design changes. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11557 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-process-landing-page-concept.jpg" alt="elements that work in website redesign" width="626" height="626" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-process-landing-page-concept.jpg 626w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-process-landing-page-concept-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-process-landing-page-concept-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">These elements can include the logo, images, typography, or the colors used on the website, anything. When analyzing the old design of your website, if you happen to find any elements of the design that works perfectly fine, you should integrate them into your website seamlessly. </span></p>
<h2 id="Make_proper_use_of_your_user_data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Make Use Of The User Data</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the user from the very beginning of the website design process should’ve been a priority for you. But if you failed to apply it, then no worries, you can do it during the redesign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will collect plenty of data throughout the operation period to analyze and learn what exactly went wrong with the design of your website in the first place. This user data will answer all your questions about where the users got stuck while navigating the page, where they got exhausted and left the page altogether. It will help you recognize all the snags in the design and smooth it out. </span></p>
<h2 id="Build_your_idea_wireframes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Build Wireframes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How about before you redesign and launch it, you build an interactive MVP or wireframe, and have it tested?</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11558" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11558" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11558 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Toonyport-Wireframe@1.5x.png" alt="website redesign tips" width="1600" height="865" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Toonyport-Wireframe@1.5x.png 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Toonyport-Wireframe@1.5x-300x162.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Toonyport-Wireframe@1.5x-768x415.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Toonyport-Wireframe@1.5x-1024x554.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11558" class="wp-caption-text">Web design wireframe idealized by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will help you to have built a wireframe first and have it tested before actually implementing the design. You can collect data on how hard or easy it was for the users to navigate through the entire design, the points they got stuck on and the navigational points they were confused about. Creating a wireframe before redesigning is going to only enhance the benefits of the redesign process. </span></p>
<h2 id="List_the_elements_that_need_a_redesign"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. List The Elements That Need Redesign</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we come to the most important part- the design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, when talking about website redesign we can not skip over the part of the design. There are many elements of designing you have to take care of while redesigning. Below are a few of them.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Make It Responsive</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first design element you have to consider is the responsiveness of the website. You need to keep in mind that today most people will be using their phones to access your website. And in order to accommodate them, you have to make sure that your website is responsive. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11559 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/responsive-web-design-devices.jpg" alt="how to redesign a website and make it responsive" width="626" height="626" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/responsive-web-design-devices.jpg 626w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/responsive-web-design-devices-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/responsive-web-design-devices-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, it doesn’t take a lot of effort to turn your website into a responsive website and helps a lot to impress and convert clients. So if your website is not already mobile-friendly, then make sure that it is during the redesign phase. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B: Using Proper Images And Illustrations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have briefly talked about the importance of visual design, but for this point, we have to talk about it in detail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The visual impact of the website design is more important than you think. Apparently, </span>46.1% of visitors<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a website decide on the credibility of the website after looking at the design. This is why to make the most of the visual impact, you have to use authentic images and illustrations that are relevant to your product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is an easier and perhaps even cheaper solution to use stock images and illustrations you might find online. But, they are not going to help with the credibility of the website. Even though these photographs are of high quality, they still seem fake, and you can not increase consumer trust in your brand with fake images. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11560 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/use-of-proper-images.png" alt="how to redesign a website and not ruin it" width="512" height="242" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/use-of-proper-images.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/use-of-proper-images-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of authentic images will help users to build up trust in you. So, conduct a photoshoot, or have your hired designers from website redesigning company design up some original and unique illustrations. Sure it might be a little costly and time consuming, but the positive effect of it will be worth it. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C: Branding Through Colors And Logo</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When analyzing your previous design, make sure to check if the entire aesthetic of the website, including texts and typography, colors and logo are matching your brand value. Is it how you want your business to be known? If not, then you have to opt for a complete redesign for your website to reflect the brand of your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the many aspects that’ll affect the brand image of your website are color and logo. In the long haul, users are going to remember you by the colors you used and the logo of your business. For maximum effect, you have to place the logo on the top left corner of the page. That is where the user is going to look first to find the logo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzing the famous brands in the market will help us better understand the importance of color in branding. Think of Facebook, what color do you see? Is it blue? That’s because from the beginning facebook has used the color blue to present themselves as a calm, secure and steadfast social media platform. The color of your website should reflect the nature of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When rebranding becomes necessary during redesigning, ensure that the color you choose for your brand reflects the value of what your business does, along with invoking a positive emotion among them. This simple decision will go a long way to make your brand a world-famous one. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D: Adding Landing Pages</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the conversion is one of the main website redesign objectives for your website, then you have to make sure to create new landing pages.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: We Know The Secret Language Of Design</span></h3>

<figure id="attachment_11561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11561" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11561 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-principles.jpg" alt="web design principles" width="512" height="314" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-principles.jpg 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/design-principles-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11561" class="wp-caption-text">Source: interaction-design.org</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We make sure to follow all of the important design principles, whether we are talking about the rule of the third or the proper use of negative space. We focus on design principles that bring on maximum conversion for your business. At the end of the day, the design is not just a matter of aesthetics, it is a matter of fulfilling your website revamp objectives. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B: We Can Help The Users To Find Their Way: On Your Website</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we talk about navigation, we don’t mean navigation of a ship, but the navigation of a website. We make sure that the navigational flow from pages to pages on the website is smooth and without any hitches so that users can go from point A to point B on the website without any problems. We strive to make the navigation of the website so easy that the user feels like an expert sailor, of the internet. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C: No More Confusion For The Users When Making Choices</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting the users with so many options will only make them confused and dazed. And that’s why we follow the Hick-Hyman Law. According to the law, narrowing down the choices presented to the user to the very basic and necessary few will help them to take action. Being too confused with numerous choices will only annoy them and they will eventually leave. And that’s why we make it easier for the users to make their choices. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D: How Fast The Website Needs To Be?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one has the time for slow loading web pages. Any page that takes more than 2 seconds to display any kind of information will be abandoned by the user in a heartbeat. And that’s why our web redesign best practices include making the website a fast loading one so that the user doesn’t have to wait to begin their journey with you. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E: How Important Is It To Go Social On Your Website?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting social is very important today, especially if you want more sales and customers. And that’s why we made sure to integrate social media integration as a part of our web design best practice. Whether it is sharing your website blog through social media or being a part of your social media journey, we help the users to connect to you on a social level so that the connection only gets deeper with time. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Optimizing user experience forms an integral part of front-end development. There are variety of devices which one uses today. They range from Smartphones to Tablets and iPads. Adjusting to the device’s layout is primary for a company. Especially when it comes to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank"><strong>responsive web design</strong></a> services, there are a plenty of options. Web designers around the world now primarily focus on enhancing user experience. So, responsive design plays a pivotal role.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Necessity of Responsive Web Design</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not due to the growing popularity of mobile devices. There are factors that make responsive design popular. Infact, there are many things which are responsible. Google recommends it to improve the mobile configuration. Not all websites with responsive design have the same URL and HTML. Irrespective of the device, Google can crawl many website versions. There is yet another reason. It becomes easier for Google to share content with the same URL. For instance: anybody sharing something via mobile will have more visibility. On the other hand, the same thing shared on desktop might not be so popular. Companies offering responsive web design services focus on mobile devices now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is yet another reason for the evolution of responsive design. It’s the viewing experience. Anybody viewing a website in various devices must have uniform experience. You might access a website via mobile while on work. Arriving at home when you access the same web page via desktop, it must be the same. Deviations in user experience in various devices make the user irritated. He or she can abandon the website at anytime. As a marketer, you have to be careful that your website gives the best user experience. Create a positive user experience. It must be the primary focus of the marketers in the digital transformation era.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Managing a website becomes much easier while one opts for responsive design. One can run independent campaigns for website and mobile. There are separate keywords for both the platforms. One can optimize the website according to the search results. This will make the task of the marketer easy. He or she can connect with the customer easily. A key part of responsive web design services include the right strategy. It is applicable for both mobile and website. 67% of users claim that they benefit from a mobile friendly website. Hence, most of the companies now focus on responsive website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Real Secret To Use Media Queries In Responsive Design</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was way back in 2004, when media queries came in to use. They came with CSS2.1 and HTML4. At that time,it was possible to make separate styles. It was available for computer display and printout format. The most important benefit with CSS3 is that you can use it to define styles. When the page width matches with the device size, it is possible to make layouts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, what are the real secrets of media queries that help you to define responsive design. It is time to take a look at them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Make Smart Zoom Possible</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the mobile browsers work one smart feature – smart zoom. The purpose is to enable the mobile users offer a great reading experience. It reduces the proportionate size of the page. As a developer, you can do it in two ways. Opt for user-initiated zoom. You can also display the zoom in version of the previous page while the page loads. To do this, set the initial scale at 1. This will allow you to control the level of zoom easily. But, you can also disable zoom with scalable false.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Adjust Page Widths</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Often there are confusions when it comes to responsive web design. Should you design for the desktops, smartphones or tablets? If you design for all of them, then what should be the page dimensions? There are no set standards for these devices. However, you can use 320px, 480px 1024px, 1200px as dimensions. The main benefit is that you can target most of the devices with such measurements. The most commonly used dimensions are 320px, 768px, and 1200px. They will be sufficient for laptops, desktops and smartphones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Psuedo Elements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Showing hidden information is possible with media queries. Use CSS to make it possible. If you are doing it for the first time, then hide few elements. This will reduce the number of on screen elements especially in a smartphone layout. If you want to get creative, it is possible with CSS psuedo elements. One can use it in the specific elements of HTML. It can define all the styles within the links. As a developer, you can create various layouts with one single button. It is possible to use a single icon both in smartphone and tablet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Calling Styles With Media Queries</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One important reason why most of the developers use media queries is to call styles. They help to adjust with the user dimensions of the device. They depend on the viewpoint and the container. It’s an effective way to display various content in devices. As a developer, one can adjust the width and height of the devices. All that matters is the effective implementation of the calling styles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is even possible to call the external style sheets. Follow the mobile UI patterns and check the physical attributes of the viewport. One can call the CSS declarations to adjust the device width and height. They are not so modular. But, elemental queries serve as the solution for responsive web design services.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Wrap Up</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Responsive is the future of the digital transformation era. It will lead the industry to a new level. The functionality of a website will increase. Mobile users will view content in an all new manner with greater innovations. Responsive web design services will focus on enhancing the user experience. It will form the basis for an increasing user interaction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As per a comScore <a href="https://marketingland.com/digital-growth-now-coming-mobile-usage-comscore-171505" target="_blank">report</a>, 65 percent of the online traffic generates from mobile phones, while desktops are a secondary option for global internet users. Entrepreneurs now have to live up to the expectations of the customers, when it comes to offering them the best services. In other words, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank">responsive web design</a> plays a crucial role in establishing your business as a leading brand.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Seamless Design With Great Functionalities </strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so much addicted to using mobile phones in our daily lives that it has now become a habit for us to take its advantage for all purposes. Those days are gone when there were separate designs for separate mobile devices. Now, things have changed. The next generation wants everything within their fingertips. Here, comes the role of responsive web design. It offers a seamless solution to scroll through the website without causing any disturbance in web page view irrespective of the type of device one uses. It is a more systematic approach to present your website in the clearest manner possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Designers must understand that the viewing experience on a mobile phone is entirely different from the viewing experience on a desktop. One of the most basic reasons is the variation in the screen size. On the other hand, designing for mobile is not only confined within the limits of adjusting to screen resolution; in fact, it also includes resizing the images perfectly in sync with the screen sizes of various devices. Sensors or robotic might not make this possible, but an intelligent way of solving this can be the ultimate solution. Hence, the ‘one size fits all’ is what the concept of responsive is all about.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any content on a website, including the images and pictures, are like water when it comes to responsive web design. With fluid grid concepts and media queries, anything present on the website quickly adopts itself with the devices. It depends on the user’s behavior and the environment for a web page. Hence, a user-centric approach is the best strategy for a seamless design. Today, a user often shifts between a mobile phone and a tablet. This shift includes a shift in the screen size and resolution. Hence, there is a need for a universal design, which can easily habituate itself with the required resolution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make your task easier, we present 5 simple responsive web design rules for better user experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 1: Keep The Content Clear</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Understand one mobile psychology – mobile users always use their device while on the go. They are always in a hurry to find the information they are looking for. As a designer, your task is to provide them the most convenient way of browsing. Avoid clutter on a page and allow the page to breathe. Think from a visitor’s point of view. Use either a call to action line or a highlighted text to focus on the most important part of the message. Remember, it’s always the small things, which matter the most to the users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 2: Make Fluid Layouts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not every mobile phone has the same dimensions. As a designer, don’t get satisfied with a 320 width design. This is the most common dimension kept on a website. Do not confuse between the various website layouts. Always keep a fluid layout to give the best possible viewing experience to the visitors. You not only want to work it on a device but at the same time also want to make it look more attractive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 3: Touch-Based Design</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keyboard and mouse no more form a part of browsing a website. With a dominant market of mobile all over the world, the focus has shifted from click to touch. Design should focus on the touchpoints like buttons, forms or any other elements. They should not overlap with each other or with any other adjacent elements. Do not solely depend on touch points as many devices use styluses as well. Be ready to design for devices with numerous functionalities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 4: Use Less Images</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know that website speed and size of the images are the two most important factors that decide the performance level of a mobile website? Avoid applying fancy effects and putting gradients to all the images. Apply CSS techniques and see what works better with images. Remember, some CSS3 effects might not work the best in all mobiles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 5: Minimum Details On Forms</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most common problems on a website is the process of filling up long and complicated forms. Mobile screens with the size of 5mm can make it difficult for the user to locate the information. Hence, keep minimum fields for the user. You can also use the auto fill option as a default option to avoid misplacement in the forms. Apart from this, there’s also an option to show progress bars at the moment the users completes filling up the details in the form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Always keep in mind that while it comes to responsive web design, the principle is to maintain the minimalism. Users tend to behave differently for iOS and Android. The best way is to research about your target audience and know their preference pattern. The check out process is something, which you should take utmost care. Studies show that visitors abandon a website due to a bad check out process experience. If you have an ‘Add to cart’ or an ‘Add to basket’ option, then make sure that the icon is clearly visible to the user.</p>

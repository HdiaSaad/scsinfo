										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">AngularJS is the only framework in the world, which doesn’t use MVC. Like any other development tools, that use a bunch of existing tools, Angular comes as stronger option to most of the developers. The recent development in the web development industry shows that there is no doubt in making this as the ultimate tool. Angularjs development comes across as the most formidable solution for solving the most complicated problems. Developers and large business enterprises like YouTube, Netflix, The Guardian, Paypal and many more depend on this framework to get the best results for their business.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Why Companies Look Forward To AngularJS?</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The emergence of single page app is due to the increasing demand of offering the most sophisticated user experience. This modern framework allows single page applications to function properly in mobiles and desktops. Without a proper framework, there will be no fluid user experience. Now, users will get livelier buttons as well as hyperlinks on websites. AngularJS development will also have a significant impact on design. The evolution of this framework was due to the need of adding an UI element with logic. Even, Google’s Material Design is one of the examples of utilizing AngularJS as a form of user interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To develop robust browser based applications that behave like native apps, this single page framework is the best option. Due to the immense popularity of the angularjs application, developers depend mostly on this framework. Whether it is for payroll, airline or video streaming, it is completely dependable as a native web application. Another reason why companies look forward to Angularjs is that it makes testing easier. As a tester, one can find bugs very easily. It is easy to understand user behavior with the help of automated tasks. All the user has to do is to click the buttons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the most dependable framework, which is properly licensed and at the sametime it is also free from any kind of legal complications. From a developer’s point of view, there is full independence to write code. Moreover, if the organization for which a developer works, uses Express, Symphony and Backbone, then a licensed software is already in use. AngularJS does the right thing by developing framework which are not only legal to use rather it equips the developer with plenty of helpful resources and libraries. So, if you are a developer, then it will be extremely beneficial for you, once you master AngularJS.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Direct Benefits Of AngularJS Learning To A Developer</em></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the world of web application development, there is a need of versatility when it comes to choosing a strong developer. Learning AngularJS development will not only help you earn laurels, in fact you can be the master in the app development world. Reason? That’s because most of the leading organizations around the world depend on this framework to make sophisticated projects and look forward to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-angularjs-developers/">hire angularjs developer</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Perfect MVC Management</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can learn to manage MVC in the perfect manner. This is one of the major benefits of angularjs. While in other frameworks, the components need to split the app into various components. No such things are necessary while you are doing angularjs development. You can manage the components and at the same time can work in the pipeline, which connects them with each other. It acts as a mediator and even developers will not need to write codes separately to fit then in the web application. Hence, you perfectly master the development process while working at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use It As A Declarative Language</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">HTML is the main and the primary element used in AngularJS. Apart from being more intuitive, it also defines the interface of HTML in a perfect manner. More than one developer can work easily when one writes the code in HTML itself. There is a declarative approach, which simplifies the process of app development. The program flow is an important task. It takes care of the dependencies itself. So, a developer can focus more on other phases of development. As a developer, you will always be on the brighter side as you learn a separate language and learn to work with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Directives Combined With Behavior</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Directives add more functionality to HTML. We do not have to change the DOM to stimulate them. An application needs to understand the attributes of the elements to get the functionality in the box. One has to invent the HTML elements of their own. One must put the DOM manipulation code in the directives first. During angularjs development, one should update the view with the latest directives. Always keep in mind that directives should manipulate DOMs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Manipulate DOMs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The DOM manipulates itself while adding the behavior. With the help of AngularJS, all codes come within directives, but not in the view itself. As a framework, it comes in the form of an HTML page. This encourages user interface designs. A developer can abstract all the DOM manipulations along with the jQuery calls. Without any distractions, one applies on the MVC app. One doesn’t have to worry about changing the DOM at all. Presenting the business data in the views make it easier even for the user as a web developer. The web app development process speeds up. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/top-10-reasons-use-angularjs-apps-development/">This is one of the prominent benefits of angularjs</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Easier Unit Testing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is your unit testing ready? Well, most of the frameworks remain connected with each other with Dependency Injection. To manage the scopes and controllers all the dependency injection passes the information. The unit testing process of AngularJS, HTTP provider introduces fake responses in controllers. There are many components used in web development domain for writing compulsory programming.  One can choose generic web apps to make a viable framework and build along with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a developer, there are various challenges, which one has to face whether it comes to developing a web or a mobile application. Knowing Angularjs opens many paths of development and removes all impediments, which fall along the path of developing an app. Hence benefits of angularjs are eminent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Planning for a major web application release in the near future? Deciding the web frameworks is one of the important characteristics. The presence of numerous other frameworks in the market along with strong libraries is also a factor that is to be kept in mind. Well, if you are thinking about the long-term benefits, then there is no doubt that frameworks like Ember and Angular prove to be the most fruitful ones, but when it comes to taking a business decision, then it is often confusing as one is not able to take the right decision.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net" target="_blank">Team Unified</a> will clarify all your doubts that arise while you are planning on how to select a good framework. Our many years of experience whether it is working in </span><a title="AngularJS Development in USA" href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-angularjs-developers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>angularjs development</b></span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> or Ember js have made us capable to help you take the right decision.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>AngularJS – What are it and its usability?</b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Based on the simple modular code, </span><span style="font-size: medium;">this framework</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> successfully expands the functionality of HTML thereby solving the problem of SPAs. It’s helpful features help to solve some problems such as simplifying syntax with the help of vanilla JavaScript objects, developing DOM with directives and creating dependency injections. It acts as a catalyst and helps the application to run quicker. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">In addition to this, it also supports the MVC architecture. The two-way binding process is yet another feature that reflects any changes in the view. With the help of Angular Directives, you can also extend the functionality in the existing HTML elements. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">The good news is that the latest version (AngularJS 2.0) is set to ease the process of web development. It comes charged with a host of powerful features. Take a look at them: </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Five times faster performance than AngularJS 1</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Better server-side rendering </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Presence of native Graphic User Interface (GUI)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Takes advantage of the most popular language features</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">An easier framework to test</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Making inroads in the industry</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Owing to its flexibility and great features, the framework has found its place in many well-known online ventures. Some of the most notable ventures are Freelancer.com, Netflix.com, Upwork.com, istockphoto.com and YouTube PS3.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><a title="Ember.js Development Service" href="https://emberjs.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>Ember.</b></i></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>js</b></i></span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b> – What are it and its usability?</b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">An exceptionally great framework, Ember.</span><span style="font-size: medium;">js</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> is an expert in developing beautiful and dynamic SPAs. It works on open source frameworks such as Backbone.js and Ruby on Rails and makes an open-source JavaScript framework easier. Some of the key features that make it stand apart from AngularJS are the use of accessors, string-based system of template, complex and powerful routing. The string-based templating system makes it possible to have faster boot times by compiling templates on servers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ember.</span><span style="font-size: medium;">js</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> 2.0 is also in the lineup as the second version of AngularJS. A host of interesting features also awaits here. Let us take a look at them.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">10 times faster than Ember.</span><span style="font-size: medium;">js</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> 1</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">The facility of server-side rendering </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Greater framework approach </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">The facility of command line </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Some of the notable companies that use ember.js are Yahoo, Yapp, LinkedIn. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>One of our notable works in AngularJS</b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">With AngularJS, one can make the impossible, possible and we have been successful in providing an unavailable custom-based solution with the help of </span><span style="font-size: medium;">this wonderful framework</span><span style="font-size: medium;">. We created an online open-source music player &#8211; one 1daytrack, which was able to play music online in all types of browsers starting from Safari to Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. We used AngularJS for front-end development. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Some of the glaring features, which we were able to add in 1daytrack </span><span style="font-size: medium;">are as follows:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">A multi-platform music portal, which would run in any browser</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Create a proper track queue management system to enable the listeners to listen to all the previous tracks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">An auto adds a feature which would allow the listeners can automatically add the last played song in a particular category.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">View the profile of DJs, book any one of them and get access to all their social media accounts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>And the winner is… </b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">The purpose of Angular and Ember.</span><span style="font-size: medium;">js</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> is the same, which is to make dynamic SPAs with interactive UI/UX to make the process of web development easier. Both of them offer facilities such as modular code, easy unit testing, DOM manipulation and various benefits of the MVC architecture. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Hence, talking about the best frameworks between the two is really difficult as the two of them emerge as the ultimate winners in their areas of strength.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">AngularJS is the best framework to work with if you are working on a project from the initial stages and the app which you want to develop is smaller in size. You can work with the vanilla JavaScript object while applying the coding speed. Even if you want to manipulate the extended DOM with an HTML syntax, even then it is possible. Moreover, </span><span style="font-size: medium;">the second version of this framework</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> has a host of benefits (as mentioned above) and will subsequently fasten the web application development process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other hand, Ember.</span><span style="font-size: medium;">js</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> can be of great help if you want to make the SPAs of your application right from the beginning. This framework was mainly developed in order to reduce the burden of coding from the shoulders of the developers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">With faster boot times and fixed stability, this framework allows your application to be smaller thereby making it run even slower. Well, with the release of its second version, Ember.</span><span style="font-size: medium;">js</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> is expected to boost the server side rendering further.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">The future of both these frameworks is brighter. Even the upgraded versions of the frameworks will be stronger, faster and will support server side rendering. One of the interesting things which are common among the two of them is that both of them support iOS and Android. If we can do so much right now with these modern frameworks, then one can imagine the kind of possibilities that can be created. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">The word is moving today at a blazing fast speed. AngularJS and Ember.</span><span style="font-size: medium;">js</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> will no doubt help to keep the pace of web development in tandem with this moving speed in the world of technology. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In this digital age of the 21</span><sup><span style="font-size: medium;">st</span></sup><span style="font-size: medium;"> era, developing a web application is more than something than the word ‘modern’ itself. Open source web applications came into the fore in order to facilitate the task of a programmer when it came to modifying the source code of an application. But over the years, with the emergence of more sophisticated technologies, this kind of application has undergone a futuristic makeover. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>The Power of four…</b></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Because that’s what defines </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>M</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Mongo DB) </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>E </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Express)</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> A</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Angular JS)</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> N</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Node JS) &#8211; a single language that has been developed which runs only on JavaScript and helps to build robust web applications. It takes </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/" target='_blank'>web application development</a> </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">to a completely new level. It keeps the application organized and is to date the best readable open-source solution for all projects. From the client, to server to persistence, this innovative approach for developing web applications is taking the technology world in its grip. In fact, if you have never used MEAN in any of your web development project, then it is time to make use of the mean machine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are still thinking about whether to use MEAN stack or not, then relax, we have found a solution to your problem. We present to you some solid reasons for why you should use this in your next web application development project.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Full Cloud Control by MongoDB</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A more secure database is now available in MongoDB that provides maximum protection to the data. The two key USPs of these advance level security layer are cluster support and automatic sharing. As soon as you install MongoDB, it automatically connects with all your servers in order to provide backup support in case of any technical failure. Moreover, automatic replication is yet another important reason why MEAN stack is more reliable. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Flexible MySQL server</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are a developer, who is reading this then you would understand the pain that one has to undergo while defining the complex process of entering data into tables while developing relational databases. But what, if you could have inserted the data smoothly? Well, MongoDB helps you to do exactly the same. All you have to do is, add a field to the form team it with the other data in the JSON document and add this to MongoDB, that’s it.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Easy Navigation Through Node.JS </b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Navigating through multiple configuration files that come with a different syntax is not only confusing but always makes it vulnerable to error, but with MEAN stack, the process becomes much simpler. With the help of JavaScript and Node.Js, you can either rewrite the URLs or can also make an odd mapping. Moreover, you don’t have to write the pages of PHP or Apache anymore. Here, you have the flexibility to get everything in one layer that will leave fewer possibilities of bug generation that often arises due to the presence of multiple layers.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Cheap Disk Space </b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">JOIN is mainly used in order to save the storage area in the hard disk by removing fields like state, city and zip code. This prevents creating any unnecessary tables that in turn creates extra space in the hard disk. On the other side of the coin, the JOINs can take up some extra space in your RAM and might not be a good idea at all. Hence, using MongoDB is a necessity as it creates a lot of extra space in the hard drive. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Programming Becomes Easier</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Coding becomes much easier with MEAN stack. You can make use of it on the client’s side as well. This means if you write a code wrongly on Node and then find out that it would have been better using it in Angular JS, then you can easily shift the code. You also do not need to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-php-developers/" target='_blank'>hire a front-end developer or a PHP expert</a> as JavaScript does this all for you. </span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Node.JS Is Faster</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The event-driven architecture of NodeJS makes it the hero. In this era, where everything is driven digitally, it is important to understand that even the minute detail of an app’s performance matters to them. With Node.JS, you can double the performance of an app. Hence, it comes as an extra benefit in the MEAN stack package.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>A Great Combination Anytime</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While there are many developers who use MongoDB and Apache and sometimes mix it with PHP. On the other hand, there are developers who use NodeJS with MySQL and Angular JS as well, hence it is never a sin to mix and match. There is no fixed rule to use this combination. One is always free to experiment.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>JSON, a Common Factor</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Whether you make use of MongoDB or AngularJS, you can smoothly distribute the data between the layers without rewriting the code again. It also enables you to make use of PHP. You can use the code here to import all the data from MySQL and process it. One interesting thing is that MEAN uses the same format of JSON everywhere. As a result, much time is saved when it comes to reformatting by making the whole process simpler. The icing on the cake is that it enables you to work even with external APIs such as POST, present GET and manipulate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Final Words…</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Most of the developers think that MEAN will overcome LAMP in the years to come, but there is no guarantee to this fact. It is true that over the years LAMP has provided a plethora of benefits as far as web development is concerned, but the introduction of MEAN has taken the whole process of development to an advanced level due to its various benefits. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The large community of Mean Stack is always there for the developers to assist them in solving the hurdles they encounter while developing an application. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Hence, if you want to accelerate your web application development process MEAN stack should be your first preference. It is the bedrock and the ingredient of success behind the effective execution of a flawless web application. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the last few decades, a number of website designing technologies have been developed or developing. Starting from the coding to designing, the web design and development companies has experienced enormous technological drift that makes the job simpler for developers &amp; designers and convenient for the users as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The web designing field is currently moving through a phase, which witnesses the rise of the Model-View-Controller framework, popularly known as MVC framework. Ti enables the website designing an easier job indeed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At present, you will come across three popular MV frameworks popular in the website designing companies. These frameworks are &#8211; AngularJS, Backbone, and Ember.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The web designers tend to choose any one of the framework stated above. In order to help you with the best framework, which is compatible for web designing here, is a guide from our UIPL design and development team to help our readers distinguish between all these three MV frameworks and know what will work the best for their business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction of AngularJS, Backbone, and Ember Framework </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Before we get down discussing these frameworks let us have a quick look on their benefits.<br />
The choice of the right framework will let you deliver the project on time, so we invest time in choosing the right MV framework for each project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Helps to maintain the code in future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. The solid and stable framework is going to help you achieve greater heights in the field of web designing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Common Things between AngularJS, Backbone, and Ember Framework</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most common factors are –</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. They are all open-sourced</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. They possess the ability to solve the problems of creating Single Page Web Apps using MV designs</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. You will find them released under permissive MIT license</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each framework has their own set of views, data models, events, and routing. So let us have a detailed view of the current trending MV frameworks that would help to select the appropriate framework for the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AngularJS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AngularJS released in 209 is one of the important parts of the commercial product that is popular as GetAngular. AngularJS comes with the most unique and innovative features and includes the two-way data binding, easy-to-test code, dependency injection and extending the HTML dialect with the use of correct directives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AngularJS framework has brought a number of innovative concepts for both designers and developers. Most of the people prefer to use AngularJS framework for their projects. Google backs the project. The core team of AngularJS constantly pays attention in growing and improving the developer’s productivity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Angular Expressions used in the AngularJS framework used in the View layer of the Angular. This expression language is powerful, that allows the developer to use the complicated logic and perform assignment operations as well as necessary calculations inside the view templates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Read More: Top 10 Reasons to Use AngularJS in <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/" target='_blank'>Apps Development</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BackboneJS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BackboneJS is the lightweight MVC framework released in 2010. Well, it quickly became popular as a lean alternative to the heavy and full-featured MVC frameworks like ExtJS. Many services have adopted BackboneJS such as Flixster, Pinterest, AirBNB and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Backbone is a lightweight framework with fast and small memory footprint. It comes with a great documentation process in which you will find the code is simple and heavily documented. Apart from that, it comes with an annotated version explaining in detail how the framework works. You can move the entire source code while getting familiar with the working process in a short span.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Backbone is not always favorable, as it does not provide any kind of structure rather it comes with some basic tools that one can use in creating structure or just leaving it on the developer to structure the application or number of blanks to fill. This framework helps to concentrate on memory engagement, one of the important factors to consider.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EmberJS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">EmberJS derived from Sproutlt and then later by Apple came to the market in 2011. Originally, it belonged to SprouCore MVC framework in 2007 that later resulted into the development of the Ember framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ember.js favors &#8220;Convention&#8221; over &#8220;Configuration&#8221;. Technically speaking it conveys that instead of writing a boilerplate code it is automatically going to configure the settings by itself. Such things might include automatically determining the name of the route and controller while defining the router resource. Ember even raises the bar by automatically creating the controller for the resource.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">API of the Ember framework changes frequently before it becomes stable. It has a number of outdated content that does not work any longer. It confuses the developers who are the novices in the framework. You may also face some of the breaking challenges as well as those that cause StackOverflow instances.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This descriptive post from <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/" target='_blank'>Unified Infotech</a> on AngularJS framework, Backbone framework, and Ember framework would help you to choose the best one for your project. Now you would have a clear idea to choose the best MV framework for your next project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NOTE: ***AngularJS and Ember include a template engine while the Backbone leaves it on you to choose the appropriate template engine of your choice. AngularJS framework has an innovative approach extending HTML, Backbone prefers the minimalism and Ember has a holistic approach that widely embraces the MVC architecture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Angular JS development is a JS framework that has been taking businesses to a different level of success. An open source framework has witnessed phenomenal growth in master businesses with a wholesome community support.</p>
<p>Earlier it started its journey with humble improvisations but with time, they have matured as a client-side MVW framework. Now it is pretty easier to build complex single-page applications. It is now keeping an equal eye on the application testing and writing, simplifying the development process.</p>
<p>Angularjs 2.0 officially announced on October 2014 in ng-conference but is still at an experimental stage. Its current version is 1.3 while more recently it is migrating to version 1.4. It is estimated that around 16—apps inside Google is running or 1.2 or 1.3 version. However, the lab stage 2.0 version is a complex and major update that is going to include some real brainstorming options for the Angular JS developers.</p>
<p>As an <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/hire-angularjs-developers/" target="_blank">Angular JS development company</a>, we though to take our hands-on before the pre-release of Angular JS 2.0 and find out what improvement we can expect from it, and what major area it is going to influence –</p>
<h2>1. Mobile Apps</h2>
<p>Version 2.0 will focus more on mobile application development. It makes everything easy to handle and all challenges related to mobile such as performance, load, time addressed.</p>
<h2>2. Modular Approach</h2>
<p>Various modules remove from the Angular’s cores that result in better performance. These will find their way to the ever-growing Angular’s ecosystem of modules. It means that you will be able to choose the parts that you need accordingly.</p>
<h2>3. Modern Interface</h2>
<p>Angular 2.0 is going to target ES6 and evergreen modern browsers that automatically update the latest version. If you build apps for these browsers means various hacks and brainstorms that make Angular harder developing can be eliminated and focus on the code related to their respective business domain.</p>
<h2><strong>Changes are always acceptable – Let’s See</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>AtScript</strong></h3>
<p>It is a superset of ES6 used to develop Angular 2.0 processed by the Traceur compiler to produce ES5 code and uses TypeScript’s type syntax to generate runtime type assertions rather than compile time checks. AtScript is not compulsory and you can freely use JavaScript/ES5 code instead of AtScript to write Angular apps.</p>
<h3><strong>Improved Dependency Injection (DI)</strong></h3>
<p>Dependency Injection – now what’s that! It is a software design in which an object is passed its dependencies rather than creating all by themselves. Initially, it was one of the factors, which differentiated Angular JS from its competitors. It is highly beneficial in terms of modular development and component isolation. However, the implementation was plagued with problems in Angular 1.x. Angularjs 2.0 is able to address this issue as well as adding the missed features such as child injectors and lifetime/scope control.</p>
<h3><strong>a. Annotations</strong></h3>
<p>You will come across tools in AtScript that associate metadata with functions. This facilitates the construction of object instances by providing required information to the DI library to check for the associate metadata while calling a function or creating an instance of a class. It is easy to override the parameter data by supplying an Inject annotation.</p>
<h3><strong>b. Child Injectors</strong></h3>
<p>The child injectors inherit all the services of its parent with the capacity to override them at the child level. As per the requirements, different types of objects called and automatically override the scope.</p>
<h3><strong>c. Instance Scope</strong></h3>
<p>Improved DI library will feature instance scope control that will become even more powerful when used with the use of child injectors and your scope identifiers.</p>
<h3><strong>Templating and Data Binding</strong></h3>
<p>Lets us look at the templating and data binding as they come hand in hand while developing apps.</p>
<h3><strong>Dynamic Loading</strong></h3>
<p>Well, this feature helps to get along with the current version of Angular JS. It will let developers and new directives or controllers on the fly.</p>
<h3><strong>Templating</strong></h3>
<p>Their template compilation process is asynchronous and the as the code is found to be based on ES6 module spec. the module loader which you will find here is full of load dependencies by simply referring them in the definition of the component.</p>
<h3><strong>Directives</strong></h3>
<p>You will come across three directives in Angularjs 2.0 –</p>
<p>a. Component – this one helps to create reusable components by encapsulating logic in javaScript, HTML and optional CSS Style Sheet.</p>
<p>b. Decorator- These directives is put to use if you want to decorate elements.</p>
<p>d. Template – These will help to turn HTML into a reusable template.</p>
<h2>Routing</h2>
<p>In the inception, the Angular router was designed to handle just a few simple cases. However, with the growth of the framework over the time we have been seeing that the router in Angularjs 2.0 has been reworked to be simple, yet extensible. Now they are going to have the following best features-</p>
<p>1. 404 Route Handling</p>
<p>2. Document Title Updates</p>
<p>3. History Manipulation</p>
<p>4. Location Service</p>
<p>5. Navigation Model (For Generating a Navigation UI)</p>
<p>6. Optional Convention over Configuration</p>
<p>7. Query String Support</p>
<p>8. Simple JSON-based Route Config</p>
<p>9. Static, Parameterized and Splat Route Patterns</p>
<p>10. URL Resolver</p>
<p>11. Use Push State or Hashchange</p>
<p>Now, let us check out the features, which make the improvement in the router as a catalyst to take Angularjs 2.0 to new rising bars.</p>
<p><em>Child Router</em></p>
<p>The child router will convert every component of the application into a small application providing it with its own router. It will help encapsulate entire sets of an application with full features.</p>
<p><em>Screen Activator</em></p>
<p>This will give developers a finer control over the navigation lifecycle, with the help of a set of callbacks.</p>
<p>a. canActivate – Allow/Prevent navigating to the new controller</p>
<p>b. activate – Respond to successful navigation to the new controller</p>
<p>c. canDeactivate – Allow/Prevent navigation away from the old controller</p>
<p>d. deactivate – Respond to successful navigation away from the old controller</p>
<p>These callbacks will allow the developer to return Boolean values</p>
<h3><strong>Design</strong></h3>
<p>All of this logic is built with the help of a pipeline architecture, which makes it incredibly easy to add one’s own steps to the pipeline or remove the default ones. Moreover, its asynchronous in nature. It will allow developers to a make server request to authenticate a user or load data for a controller when you will be still remaining in the pipeline.</p>
<h3><strong>Logging</strong></h3>
<p>Angularjs 2.0 will contain a logging service called <a href="https://github.com/angular/diary.js/tree/master" target="_blank">diary.js</a>. It is a useful feature which measures where time is spent in your application.</p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>$scope will no more be there in Angularjs 2.0 in favor of ES6 classes.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Angularjs 2.0 is the current buzzword in the mobile app development industry and one will carefully ride the top heighten as its release date nears. The beginning of March saw more details of the next version would emerge.</p>
<p>Therefore, as <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/" target="_blank">an app development company</a> let us dig in some more rich and valuable figures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Tough days, when we have to deal with &#8211; legacy code that has been around the web for years, and moved from developers without documentation, then we have those complicated interfaces making the codes more complex, next in line is the use of more than one technology in a single app.</p>
<p><strong>Crap…</strong>Fact says developer around the web never built things keeping maintenance and support in mind. Now developers are on their mark, and look for ways to fix those dents. We agree, developer’s today feel puzzled &#8211; <em><strong>Where Should We Start Or How Can We Restore The Sanity In Those Applications.<br />
</strong></em><br />
Developers who were looking for alternative ways to stack upcoming applications as a state-of-the-art design can use <strong>AngularJS</strong> to bring sanity to your apps. <strong>AngularJS</strong> is a relatively new JavaScript framework from Google, designed to make front-end development a duck soup. It comes with plenty of frameworks and plugins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though adding a new JavaScript framework like AngularJS to your web app needs some careful evaluation. As most of the projects has been using jQuery or jQuery UI and other JavaScript libraries to handle different functions not covered by jQuery or even jQuery plugins. Adding extra lines of code may slow down your JavaScript execution. And you have to invest a huge time initially to discover how to use it, learn best practices so that you can implement it in the apps easily.</p>
<p>We agree. Yes, the initial learning phase may slow down the processing, but how can you ignore the long-term benefits. If you have not tried AngularJS yet, then you are missing out a big vista in app development. JavaScript is the world’s most flexible language, its true… &#8211; find it out why with <strong>AngularJS</strong>.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>More Close to MVVM Architecture</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AngularJS integrates original MVC software design pattern to build client-side web applications. However, AngularJS does not implement MVC in the traditional sense, but rather something closer to MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). Let us explain how they behave &#8211;</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Model</strong> &#8211; This is the data in the application, a plain old JavaScript object (POJO). Users do not need to inherit from framework classes, wrap it in proxy objects, or use special getter/setter methods. This vanilla JavaScript cuts down on the application boilerplate.</li>
<li><strong>ViewModel</strong> &#8211; ViewModel helps to maintain specific views. ViewModel is the $scope object that lives within the AngularJS application. $scope is a simple JavaScript object comes with a simple API designed to detect and broadcast changes. Rather it is the specialized controller important to settle augmenting $scope in the initial state. It does not store states and neither interacts with remote services.</li>
<li><strong>View</strong> &#8211; View is the HTML that exists after AngularJS has parsed and compiled HTML to include markups and bindings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>MVVM</strong> is a solid foundation to design applications. $scope shares reference to data, controller defines objects behavior and view handles the layout.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Have a Declarative User Interface</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To define app’s user interface AngularJS uses HTML. As for HTML, we know it is a declarative language, intuitive and less convoluted than defining interface in JavaScript. HTML is less likely to break than an interface written in JavaScript. HTML determines execution of apps. Special attributes in the HTML determine which controllers to use for the elements. With HTML, app development simplifies in a sort of WYSIWYG. So stop spending time on program flows and what loads first, simply define what you want, Angular will take care of the rest.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Two-Way Data Binding</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two-way binding is the coolest concept in AngularJS. Not only an eye candy feature, but also has a fascinating real-time concept. Just like desktop application mobile apps user also wish to witness swift changes in the UI. A model that is the single-source-of-truth for apps. Data-binding directives provide a projection of models to the application view, and the projection is seamless, and needs no effort from developers. With Angular two-way binding, the view and model no longer require fresh cycles as they may be prone to bug or simply need a lot of redundant and tough to maintain the render code. Better to say, AngularJS&#8217; two-way data binding handles the synchronization between the DOM and the model, and vice versa.Here is an example that demonstrates how to bind input value to an <em>&lt;h1&gt; element</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1| &lt;!doctype html&gt;<br />
2| &lt;html ng-app&gt;<br />
3| &lt;head&gt;<br />
4| &lt;script src=&#8221;https://code.angularjs.org/angular-1.0.0rc10.min.js&#8221;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
5| &lt;/head&gt;<br />
6| &lt;body&gt;<br />
7| &lt;div&gt;<br />
8| &lt;label&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;<br />
9| &lt;input type=&#8221;text&#8221; ng-model=&#8221;yourName&#8221; placeholder=&#8221;Enter a name here&#8221;&gt;<br />
10| &lt;hr&gt;<br />
11| &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {{yourName}}!&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
12| &lt;/div&gt;<br />
13| &lt;/body&gt;<br />
14| &lt;/html&gt;</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Uses POJO Data Models</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Data models in Angular are plain old JavaScript objects (POJO), so you no longer need the getter/setter functions. Add or change properties directly on it and loop over objects and arrays. This makes the code look clean and intuitive. Traditional data models referred as data gatekeepers are responsible for data persistence and server sync. Traditional data models behave like smart data providers since AngularJS data models are plain objects, they behave more like a corkboard. Corkboard is nothing more than a temporary storage, but it works closely with the controller and view.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Customized Directives</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Directives can create custom HTML tags that serve as new and custom widgets. The apps just need to assign attributes to elements to activate the functions. Directives achieve this by allowing users to invent their own HTML elements. Well, putting DOM manipulation code into the directives makes it easy for the users to separate them out of MVC app. And leaves MVC to update the view with new data, but how the view will behave is certainly up to directives.Directives come in the form of custom HTML elements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>1| &lt;my-component ng-model=”message”&gt;&lt;/my-component&gt;<br />
<b>Example</b>: 1| &lt;myticker&gt;&lt;/myticker&gt;<br />
<b>Custom attributes</b><br />
1| &lt;div data-myticker&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<b>Custom class names</b><br />
1|&lt;div class=”myticker”&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allowing them to use them as regular HTML elementsDirectives are those standalone reusable elements that are separate from your app. Well, if the HTML 5 boilerplate adopts any particular element, it is similar like removing custom directive, and your app should behave exactly the without changing the app.</p>

<li><strong>Easy Adjustable Filters</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before any data reaches View, filters help to clean the data and involves in something simple such as formatting decimal places, reversing the order of an array, filtering an array based on certain parameter or making changes in pagination. Filters are similar to directives as it works as standalone functions that are separate from your app, but only it bothers about data transformations.</p>

<li><strong>Less Coding</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AngularJS requires less coding that is no doubt a great deal for the developers. Where AngularJS ask for less code &#8211;</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Developers do not need to write their own pipeline.</li>
<li>As for the view, it is defined using HTML to make it more concise.</li>
<li>Data model is simple, as you do not need the getter/setter functions.</li>
<li>The data-binding feature allows developers to stop providing data manually into the view.</li>
<li>As directives are separate from app code, other teams can write it without any integration issue.</li>
<li>Filters allow you to manipulate the data on the view level without changing your controllers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Less coding, helps developers to keep a track of the functions in a systematic manner.</p>

<li><strong>Built-In Dependency Injection</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection subsystem useful for developers as it makes application development easier including testing.</p>
<p>Dependency Injection (DI) allows users to ask for dependencies, rather than having to go and look for them or make them at own. Say for example, &#8220;Hey I need X&#8217;, and the DI is responsible for creating and providing it for you.<br />
If user wants to gain access to core AngularJS services, all they need to add service as a parameter. AngularJS will detect that user’s need that service and will provide it instantly:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>1| function EditCtrl($scope, $location, $routeParams) {<br />
2| // Something clever here&#8230;<br />
3|}<br />
As well as users can also define their own custom services to make those available for injection.<br />
1| angular.<br />
2| module(&#8216;MyServiceModule&#8217;, []).<br />
3| factory(&#8216;notify&#8217;, [&#8216;$window&#8217;, function (win) {<br />
4| return function (msg) {<br />
5| win.alert(msg);<br />
6| };<br />
7| }]);<br />
8|<br />
9| function myController(scope, notifyService) {<br />
10| scope.callNotify = function (msg) {<br />
11| notifyService(msg);<br />
12| };<br />
13| }<br />
14|<br />
15| myController.$inject = [&#8216;$scope&#8217;, &#8216;notify&#8217;];</em></p>

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Context-Aware PubSub System</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The PubSub is a common tool to decouple communication. However, most of the PubSub on the web are not aware of context. Developer’s at times wants a PubSub message to be readable only by children of a specific node and do not want unrelated MVC components to read messages. PubSub system in Angular helps with that and will broadcast() the message to children controllers, while emit() send messages to parents.</p>
<p>Well, PubSub is not the only way to communicate between controllers. In fact, if you want to tell other controllers to update their views, especially when a property changes, you should rely on data binding. Since, $scopes inherit the properties of their parent scopes. So a property that exists in the parent scope, modifies in the child scope, so other scopes will inherit the same parent and modification and their view updates automatically in AngularJS.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Easy Testing</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AngularJS team has made it mandatory that codes written in JavaScript needs to come with a series of tests. They have designed AngularJS keeping testability in mind, so that it makes testing AngularJS applications easier. We know JavaScript is dynamic and interpreted, and not compile. Therefore, developers need to follow a controlled mindset for writing tests.</p>
<p>AngularJS starts from the scratch, and grounds up to be testable. It comes up with end-to-end and unit test runner setup. To see it in action, check out Angular-Seed Project at GitHub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At our blog, we covered ten features that our developers feel as one of the best. These ten features can help users to get an idea of why AngularJS is in trend. AngularJS is not a cup of coffee for all web apps, but for the generic apps, it can serve as a viable framework.</p>
<p>If developers out there want a demonstration, catch up with the Official Website of AngularJS to see number of working examples and documentation.</p>

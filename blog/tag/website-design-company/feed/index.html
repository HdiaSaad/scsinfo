										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to the B2B world, irrespective of what industry you operate in, a professional web design is always the heart of a marketing strategy. A B2B website is the landing place for the e-mail campaign, digital ads, direct mailers, social media advertising, and everyday communications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you still don’t have a B2B web design strategy by a professional <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank">web design company</a> prepared for your firm, it’s the high time to place once. You may confuse between the right time for a website redesign or start bidding out website development. Check out at these six statistics which will help you determine in your web design strategy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Be Mobile-minded</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not long ago, you just expected to consider how a website showed on a desktop PC. At that point, mobile devices picked up prevalence (and usefulness), so website specialists began making portable amicable adaptations of sites to show on mobile phones. At that point, there was a move to responsive website architecture that served up an interpretation of the site contingent on the device the user was on: desktop, laptop, tablet, or cell phone. Indeed, as five years back, professional sites fabricated for mobile users that weren&#8217;t enhanced either. Or, on the other hand, versatile adaptations of the site where worked as an idea in retrospect to the primary desktop rendition. This is not the case any longer. Today, all B2B website designs ought to work with the mobile user in mind.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Adoption Rate</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">95% of American own a cell phone of some kind. The more interesting fact is that 77% of Americans owns a smartphone. So, they can access the internet and websites from their cell phones.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">All-Device Experience</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The mobile-first is not the only option for a strong B2B web design. As following the present trends, focusing on the mobile user’s experience is the key factor. Though, we argue that a desktop or laptop user’s experience is equally important. And it’s also significant to know that half of the client’s website traffic particularly in B2B come from non-mobile devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You don’t need to take our word on that. Recent reports say that 83% of global consumers report on multiscreen behavior. They used an average of 2.23 devices at the same time.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Communicate with Design</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outline of your B2B site says a great deal in regard to your firm. Is it sending the correct message? On the off chance that your site is over three years of age, it’s worth asking the question. Brands develop after some time and it&#8217;s important that the focal segment of your showcasing methodology, your B2B site, reflects that advancement. Also, your objective market needs your site to be all around composed and decent to take a look at.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thinks about have archived that 59% of worldwide purchasers would rather draw in with web content that is delightfully planned instead of outlined. (Adobe, 2015)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the above statistic shows, it&#8217;s basic that your firm doesn&#8217;t hold back on the plan of a site. If you are searching for customers with a base lifetime engagement of $10,000 + with your firm, put that much or more in the plan of an expert site.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Site Performance Matters</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design matters, yet site execution is the first step. On the off chance that site guests baffled with to what extent your site takes to load and leave before it loads, at that point, the plan has fizzled. The speed of a site has turned out to be increasingly basic to the client encounter, especially for mobile users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Actually, 53% of mobile users will forsake a site that takes longer than three seconds to stack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This can be separated assist by how much the bounce rate increases as the load time increments:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The more it takes your B2B website architecture to stack, the more potential clients you are losing. Your website design strategy ought to incorporate specialized segments for expanding the speed of your site and diminishing load time.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">SEO: Your Competition Is Doing It</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Presently, there is a considerable measure of awesome motivations to incorporate search engine optimization (SEO) in with your B2B website technique: expanded perceivably, a superior client encounter, enhanced activity, and focusing on the correct market. Another extraordinary motivation to execute SEO is because it is basic for staying focused in many ventures. A hefty portion of your rivals have actualized SEO on their sites, so it&#8217;s fundamental that you are likewise upgrading your company&#8217;s site. You would prefer not to disregard SEO just to watch all the movement from your objective market go to your rival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember that SEO isn&#8217;t just about keywords either, it&#8217;s about streamlining the coding and show the usefulness of your site. As we have specified in past sites on SEO, Google and other search engines have expressed that site improved for mobile will perform better in inquiries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A current overview found that 62% of B2B advertisers have advanced their brand’s blog for mobile with a specific end goal to enhance SEO. (<a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SocialMediaMarketingIndustryReport2016.pdf" target="_blank">SocialMediaExaminer, 2016</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For B2B advertisers, regardless of whether in aggressive spaces or pleasant ventures, SEO is fundamental to getting before a prospect when they are searching for your products or services. Search engine optimization ought to incorporate with all effective website techniques.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many B2B (Business-to-business) companies are now successfully getting great results using digital marketing tactics like PPC, SEO landing page creation, e-mail marketing, and social media linked to a CRM marketing automation system or a modest email auto-response system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Every year, people jostle at online stores to search gifts for the most special person in their lives. No doubt, a website comes as the ultimate solution for the net-savvy global audience. A <strong><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/" target="_blank">website design company</a></strong> can create the right impression on the right audience. The demand for designing romantic websites grows this time. Retailers adopt the most creative ways to create a romantic theme on their website. It’s the design company, which can turn this dream into reality. As a businessman, you must invest to get the best return. Taking an intelligent decision to design a website can give many benefits.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Modern Web Design Elements</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the modern day world, a web design is more than putting flashy elements at one place. It is more about giving an artistic look keeping the user experience in mind. This takes place in various ways. Using large typography helps the customer identify your brand from others. The more unique the font style, the easier it will be to identify. Using a large typography, you solve two purposes as a website design company. You create a unique identity and have a functional website. Make sure that while choosing a web font, you must use common browsers and systems. Typography gives the perfect hint to the target customer about your values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Semi flat design is another important trend, which is ruling the design industry. It is much easier for the users to associate. Websites with such designs can also load faster on websites. You can use subtle shadows and edit the dimensions. For instance: if you go through the website of Uber, you will notice an important thing. The shadow over homepage disappears thus relieving the image. It helps the user to understand the content. Besides this, it also ensures that visitors get a design cue. It makes their navigation much easier. Hence, you can understand the behaviour of the customers and their preferences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hamburger menus are another thing, which are in trend. All modern day websites have this menu setting as a part of their designing process. Though they take a lot of the screen space, but it takes the user to the appropriate places. Today, even Google Chrome has this feature. Using short videos are a great way to let your users know about you product. They can get an idea about the product they will buy. For a website design company, introducing videos are a great way to bring customers. Research suggests that 92% of the customers watch a video before buying a product. Hence, it forms an important component of web design.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">How To Make Your Website Look Romantic?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the vital questions, which arise in one’s mind. Since, February means the month of love, retailers will be busy to give the romantic look to the website. As a website design company, we will share with you five important things to make a romantic website. Take a look below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use The Right Typeface</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every website needs a typeface. Here, the purpose is to make it look romantic. Avoid using bold font. Neither should you use masculine fonts. Cursive fonts bring a lovely feel. You can splash out the shape by giving it a bit different look. This will make the home page extravagant. Or else, you can also put a cupid and play it with the alphabets. A web design company can also use flowery script to give it a more beautiful appeal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Creative Use Of Flowers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using red roses are such a cliché. Look for some creative solutions. For instance: you can go for various colors of roses. Take the shoot from a different angle and use it in the background. Make this as the primary theme of your website. Use the most vibrant colors of rose to give a lovely look to the website. You can also play with the rose bud. This will give something fresh to the visitors from usual bored stuff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choose The Best Color Scheme</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Red is the primary color, it is a well-known fact. Use the red color set in various ways. Use the color according to the color of your products. The items on your online store should be in harmony with red. They should not get lost between colors rather complement each other. Keep in mind about the color schemes of text as well. Everything must be in perfect balance with each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Decorate With Teddies and Hearts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s all about creating the right atmosphere of love.  As a website design company, you must create the right look for your visitors. Keep the Valentine theme alive with the help of animated hearts or cute teddy bears. As a web designer, you must invoke the feelings of love. Teddies bring back our childhood memories, hence, use them in the design too. Either use red or pink color in the most intimate manner.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Wrap Up</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a website design company, it is crucial to understand the philosophy of an online store. Unless it understands the business goal, successful execution is not possible. Not only Valentine’s Day, but February is a great time to showcase your website. Create the right impression on the minds of the visitors with compelling web designs. It has the potential to drive more users.

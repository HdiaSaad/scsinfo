<p><b>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps built for the Morocco market that record, process, and store Protected Health Information (PHI) are required to comply with the HIPAA regulations. Implemented in 1996, these regulations have protected the confidentiality and integrity of all electronically protected health information.</span></p>
<p><b>Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Act (HITECH)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Obama administration implemented this Act in 2009. The primary purpose of this Act is to encourage healthcare organizations to use Electronic Health Records (EHR). The Act enforces the HIPAA compliance and includes non-compliance penalties.</span></p>
<p><b>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Act safeguards the privacy and data of California residents, and it requires companies to notify the users about the data they collect and delete the data upon the user’s request.</span></p>
<p><b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR is focused on protecting the personal data of EU citizens and ensuring data privacy. Apart from enforcing adequate security measures to prevent data breaches, companies are required to inform people about the specific information they hold and the objective behind holding those details.</span></p>
<p><b>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Institute of Standards and Technology presents several guidelines to assist federal agencies to meet compliance requirements. Even though the recommendations by NIST are not compulsory, they emphasize security best practices across various industries and are largely supported by the Government.</span></p>

Deloitte’s report found that </span><b>the majority of company investment will go into technology modernization and artificial intelligence.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is valuable information for all C-Suite executives, as it indicates the direction in which companies are heading and the aspects of business strategy to focus on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drivers of Business Success</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_13633" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13633" style="width: 465px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13633 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unnamed-3.jpg" alt="Drivers of Business Success" width="465" height="490" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unnamed-3.jpg 465w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unnamed-3-285x300.jpg 285w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13633" class="wp-caption-text">Source: deloitte.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having established that rapid technological discoveries and developments are the driving force behind business investment and acceleration, it’s only logical that technology is viewed as the way forward. The report shows that over 50% of all CEOs are relying on new products, innovation, and the application of technology to facilitate their predicted growth. (Source: </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/about-deloitte/us-fortune-deloitte-CEO-survey-summer-2021-highlights-new.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune/Deloitte CEO Survey: Summer 2021 Highlights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the CEO</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEOs are at the very top of the organizational hierarchy, as they are responsible for the overall management and leadership of the firm. However, when it comes to business strategy and innovation, the CEO is highly reliant on other C-Suite executives to make a calculated decision on how the company should proceed. The Chief Innovation (or Technical) Officer, for example, is an invaluable asset to the company, since it is their direct responsibility to recognize business trends, anticipate customer demands and generate new, lucrative ideas on all aspects of business. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_13634" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13634" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13634 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unnamed-4.jpg" alt="Beyond the CEO" width="512" height="223" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unnamed-4.jpg 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unnamed-4-300x131.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13634" class="wp-caption-text">Source: deloitte.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><b>The recent study by Deloitte puts technology leaders above business leaders in both quantity and demand. This is in sync with the notion that digital transformation is being viewed as the way forward for most, if not all businesses. </b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/insights/cio-agenda?utm_source=press-release&amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2022_ITCIO_NPP_PR1_22CIOAGENDA&amp;utm_term=hubpage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gartner’s 2022 CIO Agenda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicates that the concept of market “disruption” is growing with increasing popularity. Firms are waging a war with each other on the technology front, to see who can come up with the latest, most effective digital solutions, going head to head with innovation and investments, until a winner is declared by the general public. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_13635" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13635" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13635 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unnamed-5.jpg" alt="CEO see technology leaders " width="512" height="315" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unnamed-5.jpg 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unnamed-5-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13635" class="wp-caption-text">Source: deloitte.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This explains the reason why the main focus of all businesses has shifted to the technology leaders. As indicated in the report above, businesses are highly reliant on their Technology and Innovation Officers to lead the way forward. </span></p>
<h2 id="id_3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top 5 Technology Trends In Business To Look Out For</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2021/09/27/the-5-biggest-technology-trends-in-2022/?sh=6a72ade22414"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes’ “Top 5 Biggest Technology Trends 2022”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2021/03/ceo-outlook-pulse.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KPMG’s 2021 CEO Outlook Pulse Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s very evident that there are specific areas in which a large number of businesses are looking to compete and excel in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise over the past few years. Increasing investments and discoveries in the field of machine learning have helped develop state-of-the-art software. This has made business operations smoother and more efficient. However, there is an endless race to push the boundaries of technology and incorporate the latest </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/custom-software-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across leading industries such as Healthcare, SaaS solutions, and Security. The AI train left the station a while ago, and everyone’s trying to get on board, especially since it’s picking up speed. Fast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Cybersecurity</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, technological advancements aren’t always used for good. There has been a significant increase in cyber attacks, ransomware and data protection breaches over the past few years. This has resulted in a large demand for effective cybersecurity solutions. One of the most prominent currencies of today’s digital world is data, both financial and otherwise. With everything being digitized, the protection of this data is invaluable to companies, as customers have to be able to trust that their information is safe and secure. Firms will invest large amounts of money to ensure this outcome, making cybersecurity one of the most lucrative industries of today’s world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Internet of Things</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Internet of Things (IoT) has gained a lot of attention of late. There’s been a large amount of success with the concept, which is to digitize anything and everything. This creates a network of interconnected devices that has the ability to store and process information. This is a prime example of the kind of technological advancements companies are conducting large amounts of research on. IoT also relies on AI to be successful. The applications are limitless, and the concept can be used in almost any industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Sustainable Energy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the entire world focused on climate change, and the rising concerns of the degradation of the planet, many companies are on a mission to “go green”, and incorporate efficient and sustainable, renewable energy solutions. Technology is the foundation upon which these solutions are being built. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development says, “We’re working to scale the use of solutions that allow companies to go low-carbon today by increasing demand for new energy solutions, facilitating the development of innovative business models as well as raising awareness with investors. These activities build on the cross-sectoral collaboration across the energy value chain that this project has already established.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. The Low Code/ No Code Revolution</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software development process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with little to no coding? Yes, please! This technology trend has surely brought a revolution in the sphere of development. This helps programmers and non-programmers to develop application software with the help of a graphical user interface instead of using traditional coding. Therefore, a lack of knowledge in programming will no longer be a barrier to converting your ground-breaking ideas into reality.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_4"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of businesses in the world today are relying heavily on technological solutions to pave the way forward. A large amount of investment is being put into the innovation and development of digital systems, incorporating the latest technology and artificial intelligence systems. Industries such as Healthcare and </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/custom-software-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SaaS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are among the more prominent leaders in this space, as the applications are extremely important to health, lifestyle changes and digital security. Between the reports and the information gathered from global C-Suite executives, it&#8217;s safe to say that the major focus of the business world is now technology modernization. This is the field in which companies are investing and looking to advance in, rapidly. </span></p>

<p id="id_1"><strong>Six of the Most Promising Healthcare Software</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following is an overview of the most popular types of software in the healthcare industry:</span></p>
<p><b>1. </b>Electronic Health Record (EHR) Software<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Just like the CRM of a business maintains customers’ data and interactions, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EHR software is a database for patients’ medical records, medications, invoicing, and payment.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows physicians and patients to collaborate and create health plans on the EHR software and keep a track of the treatment progress.</span></p>
<p><b>According to recent research, the global EHR/EMR market will be worth $38 billion USD by 2025. (Source: </b><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2409/digital-health/"><b>Statista</b></a><b>)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">two most popular types of Electronic Health Records Software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Electronic patient record software (EPR)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; This is a database for patients’ medical records from history, treatments to the recovery process.</span></li>
<li>Electronic medical records software (EMR)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; EMR keeps a track of information like medicines prescribed, their dosages, diagnoses, and medical procedures.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. </b>Hospital Management System Software (HMS)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The HMS is a business tool that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automates all the day-to-day functions of a hospital like scheduling appointments, bed management, hospital inventory, claims, complaint handling, and more.</span></p>
<p><b>3. </b>Medical Billing Software (MBS)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; As the name suggests, the accounting department uses this software to keep a record of patients’ medical and hospital bills. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This online medical billing software provides a complete end-to-end solution to track all invoices, payments, and medical insurance. </span></p>
<p><b>4. </b>Medical Imaging Software (MIS)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hospitals and clinics need imaging software to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">visualize the results from CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Additionally, a medical imaging software </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">creates 2-D and 3-D images of the human body</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and organs. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D medical image processing software </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is used in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">printing implants and medical equipment to plan surgeries and treatments.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It helps to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">detect diseases at the initial stage, identify the prognosis and take preventive measures.</span></p>
<p><b>5. </b>Medical Diagnosis Software (MDS)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Diagnosing diseases and sharing inputs from various medical practitioners manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. AI technology is developing rapidly and it has not left the healthcare field untouched. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI-powered diagnosis software </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerated the treatment process with the detection of symptoms and timely diagnosis of diseases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This software helps to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer information between departments easily and add data to patients’ cards. Although these reports are accessible to doctors in the hospital, the software maintains the anonymity of patients’ accounts.</span></p>
<p><b>6. </b>E-prescribing Software (EPS)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gone are the days of trying to make sense of your doctor’s handwriting in prescriptions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of this AI-powered software solution, your doctor can directly connect with your local pharmacy. This speeds up the process of taking medications and eliminates human errors. With just a couple of clicks, you can extend, change or cancel your prescription at any time.</span></p>
<p id="id_2"><strong>Reasons Why You Need Digital Healthcare Software</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might think that the medical industry was doing just fine without </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/healthcare-application-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthcare software solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, it is very likely that if you digitally transform your practice, your work would be more organized, efficient, and completely patient-centric</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tasks like recording, manually looking up a patient&#8217;s history, invoicing and billing, all are time-consuming and they add up.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="id_1">Introduction</h2>
<p>The impact of the pandemic has not left anyone untouched. Adapting to the new remote work from home pattern has been mentally and physically taxing on employees and C-suite executives. But we are all adapting to the new normal and working our way through it.</p>
<h2 id="id_2">WFH Changing Work Dynamics</h2>
<p>Times have changed in the past year when the pandemic fundamentally transformed the way we work. It forced the large-scale workforce to shift to remote work. While remote work from home has benefited us in many ways, it has certainly taken a toll in our personal lives.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we are free to open our laptops and work anytime within the comfort of our own room. Think about it. When work is constantly available to us, our work-life boundaries get blurred easily. A research found out that 44.4% respondents experienced deterioration in their mental health during the covid-19 outbreak since WFH became the new normal. (Source: </span><a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/confronting-mental-health/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualtrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<h2 id="id_3">Is Remote Work From Home Affecting Our Wellbeing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent study reported that C-Suite executives had a hard time adapting to the virtual lifestyles, 53% reported struggling with mental health issues while working remotely. The pandemic has been especially hard on Gen-Z, 90% of whom have been struggling with mental health during Covid and 94% Gen-Z workers reported that work stress affects their personal life as well. (Source: </span><a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/ai-at-work-new-study-020321.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oracle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is nothing more convenient than working from the comforts of our home, it has become detrimental to our physical and mental health. It is no secret that remote work stresses us out and we need to carve out strategies to keep ourselves in check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some common challenges that employees may be experiencing are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b><b><b>Struggles with adjusting to remote work- </b></b></b>While many employees have already adjusted to this new pattern of work, 85% C-level executives are having a harder time adapting to virtual work. (Source: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/ai-at-work-new-study-020321.html">Oracle</a>)It is harder for the C-suite to create a separation between work hours and the rest of the day. Some other challenges of remote work have been the stress of learning new technologies and remote work tools for efficiency and the lack of face-to-face communication with clients and employees.</li>
<li><b><b>Lack of movement throughout the day- </b></b>Most of our work days look like this- wake up, grab your laptop in bed and log into work. Our work couldn’t be more convenient, right?While remote work has definitely saved us travel time due to restrictions, it has taken a huge toll on our health and fitness levels. Sitting in one spot and staring into our laptop screens all day long has become the new normal for us. But remote work doesn’t have to sabotage our physical health. To stay healthy in this new pattern of work, we must take sufficient breaks from technology, move our bodies mindfully, limit our screen time and intentionally interact with our colleagues and friends.</li>
<li><strong>Anxiety and depression during the pandemic</strong>&#8211; Let’s be real. Work from home can be immensely isolating and stressful. Nowadays, our interactions with colleagues are limited to video calls, which are in fact no better than phone calls with our cameras turned off at all times. From quarantine, unexpected deaths of loved ones to job losses, we have seen it all in the past two years of the pandemic.A recent study found out that approximately 264 million people suffer from symptoms of anxiety and depression which costs the global economy $1 trillion per year in lost productivity (Source: <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/mental-health-and-substance-use/promotion-prevention/mental-health-in-the-workplace">WHO</a>)Despite this, we show up at work everyday, trying to give our best and keep our jobs secure. Therefore, it is crucial for companies to give employees some grace, normalise leaves for mental health and create a positive work environment where employees feel supported and secure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The need to be ‘always on’ causing stress- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote work has made work more accessible as we are just one click away from logging in and sending that email or taking that call. When our personal lives and work environment are under the same roof, it is not easy to switch off. There is always something important left that we’re tempted to tackle even after work hours. This only triggers anxiety and exhaustion and causes low levels of efficiency throughout the day. The best way to cope with this is to set clear boundaries, even reminders if required in order to shut off work mode on time.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="id_4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health Is Wealth: A WFH Support Checklist</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many organisations are adopting the remote work policy for the long-term, it is very crucial to imbibe self-care habits to get used to this culture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a work-from-home support list to help you balance your personal life and work.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Set boundaries between personal life and workspace</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Remote work can be really challenging due to constant interruptions at home. At the same time, it is tempting to curl up in bed with your laptop and a cup of coffee but it leads to low productivity. So, having a dedicated workspace is very crucial for the brain to clearly distinguish between our work environment and our comfortable personal space. At the end of the day, it will also help you switch off from your ‘office mode’ easily and get back into your personal space again.</span></li>
<li><b>Have a set routine outside of work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Having a daily routine to do the most mundane tasks can create a sense of familiarity and clarity. This is especially crucial in these unprecedented times when we are mostly doing everything within the comforts of our home. So, we must set reminders and schedule time for having our meals, exercising, taking time off our screens and waking up and sleeping on time. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Normalise leaves for mental health-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most of the times, employees feel the need to lie when taking a leave for their mental health. Anxiety and stress are parts of life and it is high time we break the taboo and normalise them. Back in October 2020, Urban Company allowed employees to take unlimited sick leaves if they were mentally or physically unwell or caught the virus. This not only creates a positive work culture, but also allows employees to feel valued and put the best foot forward at work.</span></li>
<li><b>Clear communication and team-bonding activities-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is easy to feel isolated during this time of quarantine. Connecting with colleagues and friends who are supportive makes everyone feel less alone. Everyone might have conflicting schedules, so it is important to set a reminder in your calendar for a video call or a team bonding activity at work.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="id_5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote Mental Health | Reach Out And Connect</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote work is stressful and organizations should give employees some grace and make mental health a top priority. While stress and anxiety are inevitable, we can manage them and improve our work-life balance. Remember, we are never alone. Reaching out for professional help is always the way to go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, we are all trying our best to get through this challenging period. Don’t forget to pat yourself on the back by taking a well-deserved break. Bake your favourite dessert, connect with loved ones, and do some relaxing meditation and stretching exercises that will instantly make you feel on top of the world.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="id_1">Introduction</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conflict is an unavoidable part of life, primarily when working in a high-powered and sometimes stressful industry like logistics. We cannot always control our exposure to conflict in both our personal and working lives. However, it is possible to use workplace conflict management techniques to produce positive outcomes, dissolve conflicts quickly, </span><a href="https://www.hourly.io/post/why-is-team-building-important"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> encourage teamwork</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/digital-transformation-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transform your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the office or on the road, workplace conflict can create a hostile environment. Not just for the employees involved in the disagreement but for their peers too. It can hinder productivity, collaboration, and healthy communication, leading to additional problems later down the line. As the leader of your logistics business, all eyes will fall to you to provide conflict-resolving guidance to your staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding how to skillfully and tactfully manage conflicts in the workplace can minimize their adverse impacts. In some cases, it can even swing hopeless situations to your advantage. Here is everything you need to know about good workplace conflict </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">management in the logistics industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Common Causes of Workplace Conflict</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13581 aligncenter" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Common-Causes-of-Workplace-Conflict.png" alt="The Common Causes of Workplace Conflict" width="525" height="430" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Common-Causes-of-Workplace-Conflict.png 525w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Common-Causes-of-Workplace-Conflict-300x246.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workplace conflict doesn’t always stem from people not getting along. There are many situations and logistical issues that can create animosity between individuals and teams. They include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">An inefficient working environment<b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sluggish, cluttered, or </span><a href="https://www.ukessays.com/essays/management/impact-of-workplace-environment-on-employees-productivity-management-essay.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inefficient working environment can make it challenging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find the documents or resources employees need to work effectively. It can cause frustration, negatively affecting their mood.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Poor working conditions<b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few things can demotivate and frustrate employees as much as bad working conditions. If your staff have furniture that’s less than ergonomic, dysfunctional equipment, and outdated technology, they could soon begin to take those frustrations out on each other.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A lack of breaks during the day<b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that don’t give their employees enough time to rest and recharge tend to deal with more workplace conflict. Exhaustion and frustration breed tension. Your employees need several uninterrupted breaks every day.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">High employee turnover<b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses with high employee turnover rates can quickly disrupt workflows and burden managers and more experienced employees. Relying on your seasoned staff to train a constant influx of new workers could also lead to burnout and conflict over time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Interpersonal disagreements:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Employees can face challenges working with each other for a wide range of reasons. Cultural differences, work style differences, personality clashes, teamwork issues, and miscommunication are all possible contributors. You can address some of these, and other times, differences will remain. Finding ways through which staff can continue working together, in the long run, is the key.</span></li>
<li>Leadership conflicts:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sometimes, even company leaders fail to get along for several reasons. Different employees may have clashing leadership styles meaning they stand at odds with the needs and interests of their peers. Logistics leaders need to understand their team members individually to avoid creating discomfort and causing conflict even if their actions have good intentions.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="id_3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">External Factors that Contribute to Conflict</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a myriad of external factors that can lead to workplace conflict. Economic pressure caused by foreign and domestic competition, recession, changing markets, and the impacts of free trade between nations can all exert pressure on individuals and teams. Conflicts could also develop with suppliers and clients because of these factors, impacting customer service and the timely delivery of goods and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to political pressure and demands from special interest groups and major retailers and customers, logistics businesses can also face rapid regulatory risks. Furthermore, natural disasters and unexpected global phenomena like the Covid-19 pandemic can cause widespread, lasting disruption to supply chains. They force logistics teams to rapidly adjust their strategies to stay afloat in an increasingly competitive market.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tools and Strategies for Workplace Conflict Resolution</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13582 aligncenter" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Workplace-Conflict-Resolution.png" alt="Workplace Conflict Resolution" width="525" height="430" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Workplace-Conflict-Resolution.png 525w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Workplace-Conflict-Resolution-300x246.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only proper way to deal with workplace conflict and promote positive resolution is to implement intelligent workplace conflict management strategies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some proven strategies that will assist you.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Develop Conflict Awareness Skills</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use conflict management practices to develop your </span><a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships-communication/conflict-resolution-skills.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conflict awareness skills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and pass those skills along to your team. Having these skills will enable you to identify conflicts in the workplace and gain as much clarity as you can about the situation at hand before you act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start developing conflict awareness by following these key steps when a conflict becomes apparent:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify the root problem at the core of the conflict</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assess what is at stake for you and the risks you may be taking if you choose to address or ignore the issue at hand</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assess what is at stake for the other parties involved in the conflict</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyze how you are handling the situation currently and ask yourself if you could make any changes to improve your approach and the outcome.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Foster An Environment that Promotes Conflict Resolution</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your workplace environment needs to be as neutral as possible to facilitate healthy conflict resolution. Let’s elaborate using examples of conflict in the workplace scenarios. Say two of your employees, Steven and Lana, are experiencing a disagreement over what Lana perceives to be rude and inconsiderate treatment by Steven. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the rest of your team actively takes sides in the argument, they could fuel further conflict and hinder Steven and Lana’s ability to find a resolution for the issue. Encouraging a neutral environment lets all of these parties know that you want to find a solution or agreement and move on as soon as possible.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Keep Developing Your Workplace Conflict Management Strategy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways you can gain valuable conflict resolution skills and develop your workplace conflict management strategy as a result. A few essential tips to remember include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use neutral language. Say ‘I feel’, ‘I think’ and ‘I’ve noticed’ rather than ‘you-’ messages.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid exaggerations and definitive statements like ‘never’ and ‘always,’ as they could exacerbate feelings of tension and blame.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a moment to think about what you know about the person you are addressing. Consider their personality, communication style, and general behavior, as well as your relationship and history with them. Doing so will help you anticipate their potential reactions and communicate with them in a style that best suits their own.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about what you need to discuss. Assess and identify the core issue that you want to speak about with employees. It will keep you focused and help to prevent you from veering off track. Communicate your concerns in a specific, straightforward and neutral way without accusation.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Focus on Behaviors, Not People</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking an accusatory tone rarely resolves conflicts in the workplace and can make it worse. Be sure to focus on specific problematic behaviors rather than making comments about people’s personalities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s crucial to be extremely clear about the outcome you want to achieve and be honest with everyone about how you think you could resolve the issue. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Hold Team Building Exercises</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team building exercises give your employees the tools they need to work harmoniously as a team. They boost morale and productivity and can also reinforce your position as a thoughtful and capable leader. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These exercises can range from a quick game to a meeting, conference, or even a retreat that fosters teamwork skills and assists your staff in learning about each other’s work and communication styles. Include your HR and management teams to provide them with a fun learning experience.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Takeaway<br />
</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workplace conflict management is a skill that can be fostered and enhanced through regular practice and thoughtful communication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effectively managing workplace conflict will enhance your team’s relationships, improve their ability to communicate clearly with each other, and build trust throughout your logistics business.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="id_1">Introduction</h2>
<p>The entire gamut of business went through turmoil as soon as the pandemic hit the globe. However, amidst all these, the business world has also undergone some remarkable, unseen, and positive changes. Entrepreneurship picked up, remote work culture became the new normal, E-commerce scaled newer heights and what not! And all these have been possible due to the huge digital transformation that has been happening over the last few decades or basis the need that evolved due to the recent pandemic.</p>
<p>Well, when it&#8217;s about digital transformation, the telecom industry proved to be one sector that not only sparked the revolution, but has also been the flag bearer since long time now. To note here, telecom industry has almost become a synonym to this digital shift.</p>
<p>But then, this trajectory shift in digital space is the outcome of facing unknown or unheard challenges, overcoming them, and finally building robust technologies to bring in a digital revolution. In this blog, let&#8217;s have a look at some of the greatest challenges faced by the telecom industry and how it overcame them while maneuvering this remarkable <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/what-is-digital-transformation/">digital transformation</a> in real-time.</p>
<h2 id="id_2">Challenges of Implementing Digital Transformation in Telecom Industry:</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge #1: Super Fast and Responsive Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>While customers don’t like to wait in queues, customer service providers were not able to handle or respond to the large volumes of calls they received. Attending such humungous amount of calls and responding to them required large number of human resources, which again made the process cost-ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>Solution #1: Putting Artificial Intelligence (AI) Into Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>As a technology, AI has been developing competencies in telecoms. AI has changed the old school ways of attending customers, handling their queries, resolving them, and boosts customer engagement.</p>
<p>These days, businesses are focusing more to become an omni-channel contact centre platform software platform. Telecom industry is putting AI into customer service and engagement to make this happen across all levels. Virtual customer assistant, chatbots, and other AI powered tools are best examples of how telecom industry is making digital transformation a reality in today’s world.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #2: Handle Complex Business Processes</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13551" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13551" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1.jpg" alt="Handle Complex Business Processes" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1.jpg 640w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13551" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Business processes usually get more complex with the high influx of data. As the data flowing in spike up, processing them or extracting information out of them gets more complex. With only human computing abilities, handling this enormous amount of data is near to impossible. And once data is lost, businesses start losing their growth and revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Solution #2: Machine Learning to Automate Businesses</strong></p>
<p>Automating businesses was one of the greatest digital transformations in telecom industry. Here, Machine Learning (ML) initiated developing competencies in telecoms by empowering machines to learn on their own over time and process massive amount of data in no time. Furthermore, by developing advanced ML algorithms, telecom industry brought in a new digital transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #3: Rise in Remote Working Culture</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13552" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-13552" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture-300x246.jpg" alt="Remote Working Culture" width="300" height="246" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture-300x246.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13552" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Remote working is the new normal and there is no denial about this! However, with the advent of this new normal, organizations started facing a new set of challenge &#8211; how to build a centralized work model wherein data can be made accessible to every employees, how to stay in sync with the employees sitting across different locations, or how to build a connection between employees and their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Solution#3: Introducing Cloud Hosted Telephony Solutions</strong></p>
<p>With these cloud hosted telephony solutions, organizations can now easily build a centralized data storage that can be managed and accessed from anywhere in world. Also, since data is stored in the cloud, it became easier for organizations to build a seamless human-device connection. By investing more on this cloud-hosted telephony solutions, service providers are bringing in a massive digital transformation in the telecom market.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #4: Rise of OTT (Over the Top) Platforms</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13547" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13547" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13547 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms.jpg" alt="Rise of OTT (Over the Top) Platforms" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms.jpg 640w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13547" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>OTT platforms started growing exponentially since last decade, thanks to the smart phone revolution! The arrival of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Netflix, and others have affected the telecom sector in infinites ways. As a result, revenue generation in telecom market started dipping largely.</p>
<p><strong>Solution#4: Develop Advanced Digital Content Delivery Network</strong></p>
<p>Another milestone digital transformation in telecom market is the development of networks to deliver digital content. Telcos adhered to the rise of OTT platforms and started building cloud hosted telephony solutions through which digital content be distributed via high-speed broadband or Wi-Fi, or even through mobile data packs.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #5: Old School Legacy Systems</strong></p>
<p>Legacy systems are traditional systems are either outdated or can no longer support the objectives of a business. Legacy systems proved to be one of the most challenging factors in the overall digital transformation of businesses. You can read more <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-fsi-legacy-systems-and-modernization.pdf">Legacy Systems</a></p>
<p><strong>Solution#5: Modernizing Legacy Systems</strong></p>
<p>The modernization of legacy systems is yet another remarkable digital transformation in telecom industry. The process requires reviewing and updating business requirements, which leads to assessing all the existing codes. Following this, advanced systems are developed to optimize overall operation and performance of a business. Even though this is quite a complex process, it ensures a high ROI to businesses.</p>
<h2 id="id_3">How SCS INFO Can Enable Telecom Clients Globally in Digital Transformation?</h2>
<p>Well, these are just few pointers on how organizations in telecom industry are contributing to digital transformation in today’s era. In our next series of blogs, we would discuss more on this. However, if your business or organization is looking out for reliable, secured, and cost-effective telecom services, you must get in touch with <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/"><u>United Infotech</u></a> to hire some of the best industry experts. And while you get in touch with them, you can have a look at one of their recent case studies mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service Industry Sector: </strong>Telecommunications and Network Services</li>
<li><strong>Client Requirement:</strong></li>
</ul>

<li>Solid or proven business consultation and planning.</li>
<li>Information architecture for website and mobile applications.</li>
<li>Compelling experience design that can fulfill customers’ needs.</li>
<li>Web development services to offer seamless user experience.</li>
</ol>
<p id="id_4"><strong>Challenges Faced By Client</strong></p>
<p>Client wanted to develop a highly interactive website that would serve as a single touch point to cater to lead generation, validation of sales, and boost customer engagement. However, there were number of bottlenecks that were challenging the entire development process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though the client had a decent visibility in the online market, their site was not an interactive one. It lacked all the aesthetics of designing with no branding elements in place. Hence, they had a high bouncing rate, and due to which their lead generation was getting negatively impacted.</li>
<li>The user experience was quite outdated and failed tragically to keep the users or visitors engaged.</li>
<li>Prospective customers find the website not worthy enough since there was a lack of navigational or structural integrity.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of the web is evolving, and web 3.0 is here to reconstruct online business success metrics. And if you are wondering what is web 3.0, then this piece is just for you.</p>
<p>The web as we experience today is known as web 2.0, aka, the social web. It enables us to consume content from various sources, and then create our own content for the others out there. It is an open conversation between us and the world out there. And in this conversation both sides able to speak to each other freely.</p>
<p>However, a revolution is on the way. Foregoing the search and data-related challenges of web 2.0, there’s a new web that’s knocking on the door. If we do the comparison of web 2.0 vs web 3.0, we’ll see that the latter promises a smarter, fairer, and smoother web experience to the users.</p>
<p>But what do these promises mean for your business website?</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: justify;">1. History Of Web Transformation</h2>
<p>To design websites for web 3.0, we must understand what web 3.0 is. And for that, we need to start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Remember the olden websites where all you could do was read texts? Such websites came with minimal graphic and interactive elements. All we could do was to consume the information presented to us, and perhaps share it through limited means. This age of the web is also known as the library web or web 1.0.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13345" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13345 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1024x567.png" alt="craigslist homepage screenshot" width="1024" height="567" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1024x567.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-300x166.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-768x425.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image.png 1263w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13345" class="wp-caption-text">Source: craigslist</figcaption></figure>
<p>But after some time web 1.0 was not enough. We wanted a streamlined manner of information sharing, creating our content, and sharing it with the world. We wanted the websites to think about us when crafting content, and designing the website. Demand for personalization, better connectivity, and more interaction took over the internet. And that’s how we got web 2.0, a.k.a, the social web. But now after almost 2 decades, we are ready to transition into the web 3.0 world, and people are already making all kinds of web 2.0 vs web 3.0 comparisons to understand which one is better.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13346" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13346" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13346 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1-1024x559.png" alt="flickr homepage screenshot" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1-1024x559.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1-300x164.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1-768x419.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1.png 1281w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13346" class="wp-caption-text">Source: flickr</figcaption></figure>
<p>And now the artificial intelligence technologies have pushed us towards the evolution of web 3.0. The term web 3.0, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/business/12web.html">coined first by John Markoff in his 2006 NY times article</a> denotes a new age of the online world. The concept is dominated by the implication of AI and machine learning usage. Additionally, the concept also makes use of p2p networks to provide a transparent user experience.</p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: justify;">2. What Is Web 3.0: The Definition</h2>
<p>So what is web 3.0 exactly? There may not be a set definition yet. But after considering its parameters, we have created a basic level definition explaining web 3.0 in a nutshell.</p>
<p><i>“Web 3.0 is an AI/machine learning-driven web that will provide the users with relevant, relatable, and valuable search results based on the context of their search, and not just the keywords. Additionally, This web is also aimed to eliminate data monopoly with the implementation of decentralized systems like blockchain and protect the user data from being misused.”</i></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13348 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-938x1024.jpg" alt="what is web 3.0" width="938" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-938x1024.jpg 938w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-275x300.jpg 275w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-768x839.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-1407x1536.jpg 1407w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-1876x2048.jpg 1876w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /></p>
<p>The debate about the current existence of web 3.0 is many. However, there’s one thing no one can disagree on, and that is the future impact of web 3.0 main features on web design. So let’s see what kind of design requirements your website needs to fulfill to fit into a web 3.0 future.</p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: justify;">3. Web 3.0 Design: A Complete Overview</h2>
<p>Now there remain one questions that need to be answered-</p>
<p>Is web 3.0 here?</p>
<p>How can your website fit into the new requirements of web 3.0? There are many answers to the first question, some more debatable than others. However, the consensus agrees that web 3.0 is indeed here, but at the very initial stage. The kind of decentralized and semantic web vision is still far from being achieved. But some features are already well implemented within our regular web experience.</p>
<p>As an experienced <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">web design company in Casablanca</a>, we are continuously working to create better and more successful design/development solutions. And that’s how we have unearthed some specific trends that will be necessary for your website’s success in the web 3.0 world. Here’s a comprehensive list of all of them-</p>
<h3>A. Designing For An AI-Driven Web</h3>
<p>By now, you must know what is web 3.0, and if you do, then you’d know that this concept depends heavily upon the use of AI and machine learning. So it is no wonder that in the future AI is going to have a bigger impact on design.</p>
<p>The aim is to create smoother and frictionless web designs that make the user experience free sailing. To design such a website, we need to begin with the right kind of data and a robust analytics system.</p>
<p>Using AI frameworks, designers and developers in the future will have a better idea of what kind of look and feel the target audience wants from the web 3.0 design trends. Based on various data points such as age, gender, location, profession, and many others, expert design agencies will be able to pinpoint the design requirements. The use of data to design an effective website is already a common practice. But in the future, it will be an industry standard.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13349 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-811x1024.jpg" alt="what is web 3.0" width="811" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-811x1024.jpg 811w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-238x300.jpg 238w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-768x969.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-1217x1536.jpg 1217w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-1623x2048.jpg 1623w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-scaled.jpg 2029w" sizes="(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px" /></p>
<p>We cannot speak about AI in web 3.0 website design without touching upon ADI, also known as Artificial Design Intelligence. Considered to be the scourge of web designers worldwide, we believe that ADI will see a boost shortly. But remember, ADI will not replace human designers. it is merely a tool that will streamline the design process.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Expert Thought: ADI systems are not the end for the designers. With ADI, web designers can reduce the amount of repetitive tasks they have to perform enabling them to create truly dynamic web designs that offer a better user experience.</p>

</div>
<h3>B. Optimizing The Website For Semantic Web</h3>
<p>If we are wondering about how will web 3.0 impact business, then we must consider the semantic web.</p>
<p>As web 3.0’s biggest USP, it will provide the users with more contextual search answers than the general keyword-based results. And to succeed in this kind of scenario, your <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/voice-user-interface-design/">website needs to be optimized well with smart voice search features</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13350 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-747x1024.jpg" alt="what is semantic web 3.0" width="747" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-747x1024.jpg 747w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-219x300.jpg 219w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-768x1053.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-1120x1536.jpg 1120w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-1494x2048.jpg 1494w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-scaled.jpg 1867w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></p>
<p>For example- when we use the word &#8216;mustang&#8217; on a search engine we get results mostly related to Ford Mustang, the famous car. But mustang also happens to be an animal. The semantic web will be able to understand the difference of context in the usage of keywords and provide relevant results.</p>
<p>Since the traditional search practices are changing rapidly. The users want the web to understand what they mean with their queries, rather than what their search query means. To accomplish that, our experts suggest using the extensive data sets on the target users, as well as structured data for web design 3.0.</p>
<p>AI-based data analytics features of web technology enable us to focus on the finer details of the end-users, understanding the context of their search activities better. For example, let’s think about an end-user who searches for a budget smartphone online. Having a finer insight into their phone usage, as in what kind of activities they perform the most with their phone will enable search engines to display phones that fit their activity perfectly.</p>
<p>Structured data is expected to be the key to the semantic web later in the future. It is a solution that is used to label data within a piece of content. This labeling practice enables search engines to understand data better and provide more contextual search results.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>C. A Changing Focus On Multimedia Content</h3>
<p>To keep up with the smart web, the search habits of the users will change as well. While previously the activity required the users to type out a search query in the browser search box, nowadays it is a lot easier. With simple voice search options, individuals can find what they are looking for online. And as an experienced <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">web design &amp; development company</a>, we aim to match our client&#8217;s website content with this search habit accordingly.</p>
<p>From the time of web 2.0, content has been king. For the last couple of years, there has been a visible shift towards multimedia content, and the emergence of web 3.0 is going to accelerate that shift. This is because of three distinctive reasons-</p>
<p>i. To keep up with the voice search trend, the website content needs to be more dynamic, fitting the conversational tone of voice search queries.</p>
<p>ii. Multimedia content will become more important. Since people are always on the go, the web 3.0 design trends are leaning more towards audio and video content that is easy to consume anytime anywhere.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13352" style="width: 946px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13352 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-946x1024.jpg" alt="what is web 3.0" width="946" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-946x1024.jpg 946w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-277x300.jpg 277w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-768x831.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-1420x1536.jpg 1420w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-1893x2048.jpg 1893w" sizes="(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13352" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p>iii. Lastly, the ubiquity promised by web 3.0 will lead to more experience-based content on the websites. Since traditional content delivery is not possible through smart IoT devices, your website content must be optimized for an experience-based approach.</p>
<p>One of the many promised advantages of web 3.0 is an efficient web experience. And to fulfill those promises, your website content needs to be optimized perfectly. By using conversational tones, multimedia content, and enhancing the content experience on the website, you can improve consumer interaction on your website.</p>
<h3>D. AR/VR Augmentation: Building A Better Web Reality</h3>
<p>Those who know the answer to what is web 3.0, also know that AR/VR is going to be the driving force behind its success.</p>
<p>Despite being well known in the design sphere, augmented reality and virtual reality are still not being used enough. However, they will become essential design elements for web design 3.0. This application of AR/VR tech will improve the quality of experience-based interaction and transparency.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13353" style="width: 946px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13353 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-946x1024.jpg" alt="what is web 3.0" width="946" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-946x1024.jpg 946w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-277x300.jpg 277w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-768x831.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-1420x1536.jpg 1420w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-1893x2048.jpg 1893w" sizes="(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13353" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether your website is an up-and-coming eCommerce platform, a B2B vendor, or a lifestyle website- the use of AR/VR is going to take the experience to the next level. The additional piece of technology will enable the users to experience the product or service before they make their purchase. This ability will help them make far better and valuable decisions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the use of AR/VR will increase the transparency level of user interaction as well. When you give them an early look at a service they are supposed to acquire, they will be more assured of the quality of the service, and its value in their life. With this technology, your web 3.0 website will be better accessible through the internet of things devices.</p>

<h3>E. Web 3.0 &amp; Internet Of Things: A Ubiquitous Design</h3>
<p>One of the many qualities that distinguish Web 3.0 from the rest is its ubiquity. It is believed that when web 3.0 is finally here, we’ll be able to access the web from any place, anytime.</p>
<p>But we don’t have to wait for that. The ubiquitous aspect of web 3.0 is already here thanks to the internet of things. The connected devices, ranging from our laptops and phones to various household objects already enable us to connect to various services online. And to become part of this connected future, your site design needs to be updated for IoT.</p>
<p>When it comes to designing for IoT 3.0, a lot of the success depends on the user interface. Popular smart devices, such as smart hubs or smartwatches come with limited processing power. So in order to make the platform work on these devices, the user interface needs to be perfectly optimized. A faster and more agile design process coupled with the design best practices will be necessary to create a perfect user interface for it.</p>
<p>Lastly, a lot of IoT concerns are generally associated with the security aspect. Surely, with limited processing power, the device may not be very secure. Keeping that in mind, the partner web design company must take every security measure to ensure that the website doesn’t pose any extra threat to the user’s data security in any way.</p>
<h3>F. Chatbots Providing Extensive Semantic Web Support</h3>
<p>We have already discussed web 3.0 features like semantic web and its impact on web design. However, there’s another side to creating a semantic experience on the web and that is chatbots.</p>
<p>You probably already have a chatbot on the website, or might be planning to integrate one. Modern chatbots are of higher quality, able to provide plenty of information and help to the users. However, it is nowhere near close to what a human would be able to accomplish. And that’s why during the chatbot integration process, ensure that your partner web design &amp; development company uses the latest technology like GPT-3.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13351" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13351" style="width: 926px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13351 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-04-926x1024.jpg" alt="chatbot experience in web 3.0" width="926" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-04-926x1024.jpg 926w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-04-271x300.jpg 271w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-04-768x850.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-04-1388x1536.jpg 1388w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-04-1851x2048.jpg 1851w" sizes="(max-width: 926px) 100vw, 926px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13351" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p>Generative Pre-trained transformer 3, also known as GPT-3 is an AI tool that has been pre-trained. It means that unlike traditional AI-based chatbots that learn as it goes- this text generation algorithm is already trained with the necessary data. It can create any content that has a language structure. This means that the use of such technology for the chatbot operation on your website will get you closer to making your website fit the web 3.0 standards.</p>
<h2>Web 3.0 Is Almost Here, There’s No Time To Wait Anymore!</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, how long will it take to develop your software solution?</p>
<p>It is a question you must have asked your development partner at least once. And it is indeed, important for you to know how much time and money it will take to develop your custom solution.</p>
<p>Proper cost estimation in project management is the very soul of the development process. Everyone is aware of the importance of providing clear assessments to the clients. Both clients and development teams would agree that the benefits of this practice are many.</p>
<p>So if you are still wondering how long it will take to develop your software solution, read on. In the following paragraphs, we are about to discuss some crucial elements of project estimation, and our in-house process of project estimation, curated by the very best of our team.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: justify;">1. Agile Vs Traditional: A War Of Estimates</h2>
<p>Once, software developers did things more traditionally. The process started with the project manager mapping out the project plan, complete with all the tasks, dependencies, and assigned teammates. However, with the rise of the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile development manifesto</a> the software project estimation approach changed entirely.</p>
<p>Early project planning methods pinned down the scope of the project and let the development time and cost vary. Needless to say, this resulted in a flawed time and cost estimation for the project. And that&#8217;s why the estimating techniques for agile projects take the opposite approach. It pins down the time and cost of development within a set range and lets the scope of the project vary.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13309 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-888x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="888" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-888x1024.jpg 888w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-260x300.jpg 260w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-768x885.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-1332x1536.jpg 1332w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-1777x2048.jpg 1777w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></p>
<p>Rather than starting with a “Complete” idea of the project, the agile process begins with high-level scoping. This way we can learn more about the project, clarify our doubts, understand the core features, functionalities needed. This understanding further helps us to streamline the development process &amp; assign the right tech stack and experts.</p>
<p>Leaving the rigid and unchanging traditional estimation process behind, the modern method creates more room for success. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/">Our agile methods</a> for estimating project times and costs ensure that the assessment is done based on a concrete understanding of the project, and not simple assumptions. Additionally, this also provides the scope of the project to change and adapt to the changing business needs, promoting future growth for our clients.</p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Project Estimation For Software Development: A Game Of Benefits!</h2>
<p>Starting the development process with a clear idea of how much to invest is not just beneficial to the clients, but to us as well. It is a solid base of knowledge helping us to assess the kind of effort and expertise the product development process needs to be successful.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13310 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-888x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation benefits" width="888" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-888x1024.jpg 888w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-260x300.jpg 260w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-768x885.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-1332x1536.jpg 1332w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-1777x2048.jpg 1777w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></p>
<p>Let’s go through the below list of benefits to comprehend how the proper process of cost estimation in project management benefits both the clients and the developers-</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>A. It Increases Trust</h3>
<p>Trust is important for any kind of relationship, especially if it is a business relationship.</p>
<p>Imagine dealing with a development partner that does not provide you with a clear budget and cost estimation of a project. They don’t tell you how long it might take to build the solution and leave you completely in the dark.</p>
<p>Sounds horrible, doesn’t it? Imagine not knowing a single thing about the very important development project that will change the face of business. Such an experience does not increase any kind of trust in the development agency. On the other hand, a clear idea on project estimation is sure to increase trust between clients and developers. And that’s why <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">experienced web development agencies</a> always ensure that a proper assessment process is integral to the development project.</p>
<h3>B. Improves The Value Of The Project</h3>
<p>ROI or return on investment determines the value of any software. How much return are you going to get from your investment in the development? And an inaccurate answer to this question will seriously diminish the value of the project.</p>
<p>Additionally, a successful development project also results in improved experience and a better reputation in the industry. This is why a reliable project estimation is beneficial for both the clients and the development agencies. For one side, it provides real value, and ROI. And for the other side, it offers meaningful experience, expertise, and an improved relationship with the clients.</p>
<h3>C. Define And Meet Realistic Deadlines</h3>
<p>Imagine launching a marketing campaign for your latest customer-facing software, only to realize that development will take more time. Not only do you have to change a lot of decisions you made, but it will also impact your reputation in the market.</p>
<p>A bona fide agile project estimation process enables development teams to understand the scope of the project and then set a realistic deadline. Starting with the initial analysis of the proposal, we begin scoping out the features, functionalities, user stories &amp; tech stack before finally predicting a range of timelines. This kind of deadline is realistic and much easier to meet.</p>
<h3>D. Encourages Faster Result</h3>
<p>It is an established truth that reliable IT project cost estimation techniques make development faster. Following the agile methodology, the project requirements are broken down and prioritized for the sprint plan creation.</p>
<p>It is more feasible for the developers to build a meaningful product with a comprehensive sprint plan. They can focus on the essential elements of development first, and ensure that those elements work perfectly for the clients. This way we can deliver a successful product a lot faster,</p>
<h3>E. Help Clients Make Better Business Decisions</h3>
<p>Imagine going grocery shopping with a fixed budget for every product on your list. And then when you get there, you realize that the price of one essential product on the list has increased. To accommodate that, you now have to eliminate one of the other grocery items on the list. This can be easily done since we are only talking about groceries. But such decisions are not easy to make when it comes to your business.</p>
<p>You can’t get rid of a business process as easy as scratching off ketchup from the grocery list. Just because you have to get a <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/custom-software-development/">custom software solution</a>, or a website developed doesn’t mean you can let other aspects of the business suffer. And that’s why you require the proper project cost estimation and budgeting. This way you’ll know exactly how to allocate resources throughout the business, and make smart choices that do not hinder the business growth.</p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: justify;">3. A Straightforward Project Estimation: Unified’s Own Process</h2>
<p>Knowing the time and cost range for the project’s development will streamline strategic business decision-making processes for you. Whether you are a start-up entrepreneur or an established businessman entering the tech world- knowing how much to invest and what to expect as ROI is the key to success. So how to estimate project cost and time? Here’s Unified Infotech&#8217;s very own process explained in brief for you.</p>
<h3>A. Beginning With A Basic Estimation</h3>
<p>Any cost and time estimation in project management provided without a clear idea of the project is irrelevant. However, the clients need a basic model before they begin a partnership with us. And that’s why our estimation process begins with a fundamental assessment of the initial proposal.</p>
<p>Based on the client&#8217;s initial requirement, our sales team consults with the development expert and provides clients with a base level time &amp; cost estimation. This estimation is never too far from how much it will actually take to develop the solution. However, it is still an initial estimation based only on the basic idea of the project. There will be some changes to this estimate during the later stages.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Exclusive insight: This estimate is never the same for two projects. Based on various factors, such as specific requirements, project type, design expectations, core functionalities, and many others, the basic estimation varies widely. This is done to ensure that every product we develop is completely relevant to the clients, and is successful in fulfilling its goals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>B. Discovery &amp; Planning: Solidifying The Estimation Base</h3>
<p>With the client on board and the kick-off phase completed, we begin our discovery and planning phase. This phase is also when we validate all the project cost, time &amp; effort estimation done so far.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13311 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-894x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="894" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-894x1024.jpg 894w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-262x300.jpg 262w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-768x879.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-1342x1536.jpg 1342w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-1789x2048.jpg 1789w" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px" /></p>
<p>The basic estimate provided by the sales team is already assessed once during the high-level scope of the pre-kick-off process. It is based on the deliverables determined through the collaboration between the client and the team. Next up comes a more detailed estimation stage where we put the details of the deliverables on the discussion board. From there, our project managers measure the effort and hours necessary for development.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of how the estimation process goes down during the discovery and planning process.</p>
<h4>I. Understanding The Basic Objective</h4>
<p>The purpose of this step is to understand the project well enough before moving in with the detailed analysis of the process. Additionally, it also enables us to complete the thorough E1 estimation that is a more precise version of the initial software project estimation plan.</p>
<p>During this, we aim to understand all the deliverables, validate the information we have till now, and clarify any additional doubts and questions. Once the high-level deliverables are clarified, we move on to the next step that is epic mapping.</p>
<h4>II. User Story &amp; Epic Mapping</h4>
<p>Epic mapping and user stories are essential parts of our E1 estimation methodology. The epic is a larger component that we can break into smaller user stories. User Stories on the other hand are informal explanations of different features written from the point of view of the users.</p>
<p>As higher-level functionalities, epics contain multiple smaller user stories. For example- in the image below, the user goals each represent an epic. To achieve these goals, the users would need to perform the activities listed as user activities. However, each person would perform the same activity differently, as demonstrated in the image.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13312 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-554x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation user story" width="554" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-554x1024.jpg 554w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-162x300.jpg 162w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-768x1419.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-831x1536.jpg 831w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-1108x2048.jpg 1108w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-scaled.jpg 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /></p>
<p>The epic mapping essentially breaks down the deliverables into smaller units enabling the team to understand what components are needed to build the solution. Once it has been finalized by both the internal team members and the client, the project manager begins the E1 estimation of the effort/size of the process. This estimation is done based on the tech stack. The hours and story points decided in this phase are as per the company baseline, and the industry standards. The range of hours in the E1 estimate also includes buffer time that is important for the successful completion of the project in time.</p>
<p>Once the E1 phase is done, the project manager reviews the effort &amp; cost estimation, and then sends it to the rest of the management team. Any differences between the initial estimate and the E1 estimates are documented and analyzed.<i></i></p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Exclusive insight: While creating a more detailed user story mapping, one of the major goals of the Business Analyst follows is to not let the details increase the estimate. However, in case the estimates increase due to the details, the Project manager must take care of the estimates accordingly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>C. Imbibing Accuracy With E2 Estimation</h3>
<p>To be exact in estimating project management, we take a look back at the estimate once again during the pre-development &amp; planning stage.</p>
<p>The E2 estimation reflects any changes made in the time and effort predicted within the previous estimates. During the pre-development process, our team aims to complete some basic tasks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13313 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-894x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="894" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-894x1024.jpg 894w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-262x300.jpg 262w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-768x879.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-1342x1536.jpg 1342w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-1789x2048.jpg 1789w" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px" /></p>
<p>The defined and finalized story point and team efficiency help determine the accurate range of development hours. This finalized software development project cost estimation is then verified by the assigned developers and TLs. Once it is approved by the internal team, the project release plan is sent to the clients.</p>
<p>The project release plan includes crucial information on the release of each spring and the amount of payment for them. We follow this estimation throughout the development with minimal to no deviation whatsoever.</p>

<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: justify;">4. Lastly, Some Best Practices To Keep In Mind</h2>
<p>It is not always possible to be super organized during the development and project estimation process. Project scopes evolve, business requirement changes, markets turn 180 degrees on their head, and client preferences change as well. Amid all this chaos, the development agency you partner up with must follow a well-established set of project management estimation best practices. What are they, you wonder? Well, here’s a list-</p>
<h3>A. Honesty/Clarity About The Figures</h3>
<p>Honesty and clarity are the most important thing when it comes to project estimation. How else can we gain the trust of the clients?</p>
<p>Our estimates are based on concrete knowledge of the project, as well as the complete idea of all the requirements, such as tech stack, third-party components, and internal resources necessary. By providing an honest estimation to the clients, we enable them for future growth and build a longer-lasting relationship with them.</p>
<h3>B. Setting Clear Assumptions</h3>
<p>While it might be possible for the development teams in the movies to build an impossible amount of deliverables within a short amount of time, it is not the case for real-world developers. In real-life scenarios, client preferences change, markets change, and a lot of other things might delay or hamper the development process.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13314 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-934x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="934" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-934x1024.jpg 934w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-274x300.jpg 274w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-768x842.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-1401x1536.jpg 1401w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-1869x2048.jpg 1869w" sizes="(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" /></p>
<p>And that’s why the second cost estimation best practice we follow is setting clear assumptions. We neither overestimate nor underestimate a project scope. Considering a proposal from a real-world perspective, we set a clear picture of how the development process will be like to the clients. This provides them with a clear idea of the investment amount, as well as the future ROI.</p>

<h3>C. Consider All The Risks</h3>
<p>Beginning a project without considering all the risks first is an act of hubris. Our software project estimation process includes detailed risk consideration and management planning. This plan ensures that in case of any challenges arising, we can mitigate it before it impacts the project or our clients negatively.</p>
<h2>Despite The Estimation Challenges, We Always Aim To Rise To The Occasion!</h2>
<p>Due to the multiple variables, it is not easy to pin down a project estimation that is 100% accurate. However, with a clear idea of the project, as well as utilizing our decade of experience, we can assess the projects well and provide meaningful insight into how many the clients would need to invest.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, do you know how much YOU need to invest in your project?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">What does it take to design an eLearning website?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not a lot! Certainly, the crowded market suggests that it is fairly easy to design and develop an eLearning website without much fuss. Although, the popularity of eLearning solutions, has made it hard to break into the market, and that&#8217;s why for the success of the platform, you need an e-learning platform ergonomic design that drives conversion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ergonomic is relating to the human factor of design, and conversion-driven design relates to business success. Combined, these two can take your eLearning website to the next level. So let&#8217;s discuss exactly how to transform your platform from being mediocre to one of the best in the industry!</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. Ergonomics &amp; Conversion-Focused Design: Why Are They Important For eLearning?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The steady growth of eLearning popularity increased when the pandemic hit. During the lockdown, about <a href="https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse">1.2 billion children</a> in 186 countries faced challenges when the schools were shut down. Besides the schoolchildren, numerous college students and employees in training also faced the same impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13285 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-775x1024.jpg" alt="eLearning statistic" width="775" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-775x1024.jpg 775w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-227x300.jpg 227w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-768x1015.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-1162x1536.jpg 1162w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-1549x2048.jpg 1549w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-scaled.jpg 1937w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To cope with this, educational institutes and corporates expanded their online training initiatives. And now it seems that this expansion is going to be permanent. Almost all learning services are not searching for solutions to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-build-e-learning-website-like-udemy/">build websites like Udemy</a> to better accommodate their students. To leverage this growing opportunity, you must understand the importance of ergonomics and conversion for the success of your e-learning platform design.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. e-Learning Platform Ergonomic Design: Why Is It Necessary?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are many reasons why ergonomics design and technology will be important for your eLearning platform&#8217;s future.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At this point, we all know that online learning is here to stay. Soon enough, there will be a sharp spike in the number of new online learners. And a lot of them might be unfamiliar with the inner-workings of eLearning platforms. To accommodate these new users, the application of the e-learning platform ergonomic design is going to be essential.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13286 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-983x1024.jpg" alt="e-learning platform ergonomic design" width="983" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-983x1024.jpg 983w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-288x300.jpg 288w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-768x800.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-1474x1536.jpg 1474w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-1965x2048.jpg 1965w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, we also have teachers who are facing the new challenges of switching from offline classrooms to online teaching. Most of these challenges are relating to the design and functionality of the platforms. With human tech ergonomic design guidelines, you can offer the teachers/instructors a better platform enabling them to offer the best of education to their students. The application of ergonomics on the eLearning platform is going to make the user&#8217;s lives a lot easier.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Conversion-Focused Design: Why You Must Pay Attention To It?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Conversion is the key to business success, and design happens to be the key to conversion. An ordinary user is not going to be aware of what goes on on the development end. They will only see the website, and its interface and decide whether they are going to spend time there or not. And that’s why investing in conversion-focused <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/website-design/">web design</a> is going to be crucial for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the color palette to the content hierarchy, everything will contribute to the visitor conversion. And to create an effective platform, you must optimize the design of the platform to match the latest conversion techniques in the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ergonomics and conversion-centric design are not matters of choice anymore. To succeed in a congested market full of various eLearning solutions, these attributes of design will give you a competitive edge. And that’s why to help you out, our in-house design experts have crafted the below guides that talk about how to optimize the e-learning UX design accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Designing For eLearning: Our Ergonomic Process</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Web design ergonomic is not a static practice. It is ever-evolving with the audience, platforms, and new trends. However, there are certain things about this scientific discipline that remain unchanged-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">E-learning platform ergonomic design serves as the point where the human factor meets the machine. It is the mix between human-ness and machine design, despite the form it takes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ergonomic elements of effective e-learning design must be usable and useful to the target audience. Any design that’s not easy to use and useful to the end consumer is not ergonomic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And last but not the least, ergonomic design will always give you a competitive edge in the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With these in mind, here are some ways our design team integrates ergonomics on eLearning designs-</p>

</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Understanding The Users: Where Ergonomics Start!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The user is where it starts from.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For a human factors ergonomics design, our process begins with understanding the users. When it comes to the human factor in design, opinions change based on the age, profession, and intention of the users. Someone who is only trying to enhance their skill is not going to have similar kind of design needs compared to a school student who is using an online platform. And that’s why we have to pay extra attention to the matter of target users while designing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13287 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-828x1024.jpg" alt="e-learning ergonomic design" width="828" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-828x1024.jpg 828w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-243x300.jpg 243w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-768x949.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-1243x1536.jpg 1243w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-1657x2048.jpg 1657w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what kind of target demographic does your eLearning platform serve? Let us take a look at the two basic groups of online learners you might encounter-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Generic Learners</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most eLearning sites serve the group of generic learners. These are independent and individual learners who are looking to learn something new on their own time. Some want to brush up on an old skill, while some want to complete a certification course on any professional skills. These users prefer the asynchronous learning module that gives them the freedom to learn on their own without the traditional education-related restrictions.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Expert speaks: Asynchronous learning is one of the main reasons why online learning has seen such a rise in popularity. And that’s why it is one of the offerings you must consider for your eLearning platform as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Learners With Set Goals</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The second kind of users is students and employees who are using eLearning platforms for school education and workplace training. They often prefer group learning sessions with synchronous learning systems. Additionally, these users are more likely to be using proprietary platforms of their institutes or companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Both groups of learners have unique requirements that the eLearning platform must fulfill. And that’s why we collect all kinds of information and data before beginning our ergonomic design process</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Keeping Up With Cognitive Ergonomic Demands With Design Psychology</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Knowing the users beforehand gives us a clear understanding of their cognitive demands from the platform. And this helps us to decide on the right application of design psychology best practices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13288 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-1024x1017.jpg" alt="e-learning platform ergonomic design" width="1024" height="1017" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-1024x1017.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-300x298.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-768x763.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-1536x1526.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-2048x2035.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cognitive ergonomics on the eLearning platform is necessary to pay attention to. This attribute of the website helps users to think, reason, read and make decisions easily without much stress. It enhances the overall e-learning platform ergonomic design experience, enabling users to obtain and retain information with ease.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a few design psychology rules we use to improve the matter of cognitive ergonomics during the e-learning platform design process-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Hick’s Law:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hick&#8217;s law is a psychological law that focuses on how long it takes for a person to make a decision based on the number of available choices. According to this, the more choices a person has in front of them, the harder time they will have in making one decision. This hardship, needless to say, will repel the user from the platform, and they will opt for some other website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13289 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-1024x1017.jpg" alt="e-learning platform ergonomic design" width="1024" height="1017" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-1024x1017.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-300x298.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-768x763.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-1536x1526.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-2048x2035.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As an experienced e-learning software development company, we make use of this law to ease the experience on the platform. For example, when they are searching for a certain course, rather than bombarding them with all the courses available, we provide them with a well-sorted list. This list enables them to change the type and filter suggestions as well. This approach makes navigating the courses list easy, and reduces chances of overwhelming the users.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Negative Space</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Learning is already a hard process for many out there. and that’s why to rest their eyes and prevent getting overwhelmed, we must integrate ample white space on the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The use of space between different design elements and content on the page is ideal to give the user’s eyes a bit of rest while they are consuming information and learning at a fast rate. This not only provides them with some breathing room but also improves the quality of education they receive on the site. The law of negative space is one of the major laws to imbibe cognitive ergonomic factors in design.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">III. The Von Restorff Effect</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mainly used for CTA placements, this law can also enhance the cognitive ergonomic factor on the eLearning website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13290 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-1024x1017.jpg" alt="e-learning ergonomic design" width="1024" height="1017" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-1024x1017.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-300x298.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-768x763.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-1536x1526.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-2048x2035.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the Von Restorff effect in e-learning UX design, we draw user attention to particular areas on the webpage. Whether it is a next slide button, or an important part of the text on the article, with this effect we can highlight the specific area the user needs to pay attention to and enhance their learning experience.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">IV. Color Psychology</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Color has always had a unique impact on the human psyche. And that’s why the use of color psychology is given ample importance in our design process. Keeping up with the brand consistency, we make use of colors that energizes and motivates the learners to keep on using the service to acquire more information and expand their knowledge. The use of brighter hues throughout the e-learning app and web UI makes the overall experience more soothing and encouraging.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">V. Typography</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">eLearning websites happen to be content-heavy. The presence of various articles, PDFs, slides, and videos (preferably with subtitles) makes it necessary for us to approach the matter of typography carefully.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rather than using fancy and hard-to-read fonts, we make use of fonts that are easy to read and are soothing to the eyes. this practice of ours helps the users to understand the text quickly. Typography also happens to be one of the most important parts of e-learning architecture design, so we ensure perfection when choosing the hierarchy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Creating Consistency And Imbibing Simplicity</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Design consistency and simplicity are the major criteria to fulfill when it comes to the ergonomic design of the eLearning site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">eLearning websites that are designed simply and consistently make for a better learner experience on the site. This approach of ours reduces the amount of time learners spend on the onboarding process. Additionally, it also helps them to focus on the task at hand and doesn&#8217;t surprise them with new design inconsistencies every time they log in.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some of our strategies for imbibing consistency and simplicity within your e-learning platform ergonomic design-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Navigational Consistency</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Navigational consistency stands at the forefront of our human factors-based ergonomics design process. by offering the users clear and well-sorted navigation, we can ease the learning curve on the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13291 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-1024x967.jpg" alt="e-learning platform ergonomic design" width="1024" height="967" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-1024x967.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-300x283.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-768x725.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-1536x1450.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-2048x1934.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The users don’t need to scramble around to find the right option to carry out a task on the platform. The navigational queues and consistency make up a big part of our design considerations.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Simple Page Layouts &amp; Navigation</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">For a positive learner experience, we group similar pages and apply a common design layout for them. This way learners don&#8217;t have to process a new layout every time and can navigate the website intuitively.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our e-learning theoretical framework uses a careful positioning of common interactive elements, such as- menus, logos, CTAs, navigational queues, etc. This way we bring a sense of unity, consistency, and simplicity to the entire website.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">III. Branding Consistency</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many websites, whether eLearning or any other tend to suffer from a lack of branding consistency. The absence of branding elements throughout the web pages will not only hurt your business but ruin the consistency throughout the platform. And that’s why our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/">agile software &amp; website development process</a> focuses on subtly imbibing the branding elements throughout all the pages. This way we can improve on the ergonomic quality of your platform while also enforcing the branding of your eLearning platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A consistent design is simple to understand, and a simple design is consistent through and through. Our ergonomic design process for your eLearning website relies heavily on these two pillars. In the end, the aim of our web &amp; software developers remains the same- to create an eLearning website that enables the users to experience the best of the platform.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Expert Speaks: Branding consistency is not just for the learners! It is a proven fact that branding on a web platform can boost employee morale as well. So if you want the eLearning business to be an absolute success, don’t skip on the branding consistency part of the design.</p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. Conversion Design: Making eLearning Platform Impactful</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Due to the ease and benefits, eLearning is now a dominant trend in the world. And just like every other trendy thing, the partakers of this market are many. To stand out among the rest and garner more users, you must have a cutting-edge conversion-driven design strategy for the eLearning site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a few pointers from our design experts that will increase the conversion rates through the e-learning UX design at a rapid pace.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Optimizing The Content For Speed</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">eLearning sites tend to be full of numerous visual content such as videos, slides, images, etc. And for the website to function properly, we optimize all the visual design content carefully to increase conversion. Here are some specific parts of our entire process that enhances conversion on the platform-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Using High-Quality Visual Content</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Low quality of visual educational elements would cause the users to lose interest and leave the platform as soon as they land on it. And that’s why as an experienced custom software &amp; <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">web development company</a>, we make use of high-quality visual elements to intrigue the users from the very beginning.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Optimizing Content For Site Speed</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">On one hand, you need high-quality images and other visual content. On the other hand, these elements need to be optimized for better speed as well. The users want a seamless experience on the platform, and to facilitate that, we follow site speed optimization best practices, so that the users can learn without any delay.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">III. Text Content Quality &amp; Language</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The text elements on the website, whether it is part of a curriculum or homepage text, must fit into the expectations of the audience. The same kind of text content will not satisfy different kinds of demographics. And that’s why we ensure that the content elements of effective e-learning design are consistent with user expectations.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Familiar Hierarchy Of Content And Elements</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Website content hierarchy is all about providing value to the users. As the owner of an eLearning site, you want the visitors on the site to sign up for courses, register for email notifications, as well as engage more with the platform. And for that, we adhere to the content hierarchy best practices of an e-learning theoretical framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Familiar homepage patterns, like the ‘F’ or ‘Z’ pattern of content hierarchy, makes for the best and most engaging design pattern when it comes to eLearning platforms. Content distributed across the pages in this pattern makes it almost intuitive for the users, enhancing the quality of the e-learning platform ergonomic design.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13292 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-1024x986.jpg" alt="eLearning platform ergonomic design" width="1024" height="986" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-1024x986.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-300x289.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-768x739.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-1536x1478.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-2048x1971.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Besides the familiar pattern of content distribution, we make use of proper headlines and bullets to make the hierarchy more prominent. This way the users are well aware of what information they are about to access beforehand. Maintaining this kind of content hierarchy throughout the pages makes it easier for the users to surf the website, and increases chances of conversion with page design.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Optimal CTA Placement</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">CTA buttons often act as a major navigational element on an eLearning website. Whether it is a signup button or a next video button, these elements need to stand out from the rest. And that’s why we take special care when it comes to CTA placement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13293 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-1000x1024.jpg" alt="e-learning platform ergonomic design" width="1000" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-1000x1024.jpg 1000w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-293x300.jpg 293w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-768x787.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-1499x1536.jpg 1499w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-1999x2048.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some of the specific CTA strategies we follow when designing an eLearning platform-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Make The CTA Prominent</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first strategy is to make sure that the CTA design is prominent and easy to spot. This can be ensured in two ways- the first being the design of the CTA and the second being the placement of the button.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the design of CTAs, we follow the brand color guideline, making it stand out among the rest of the content on the page. Along with that, we also place the CTA on an easy-to-spot place using the rule of the thirds so that the user notices the call to action as soon as they land on the page.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Use Strong &amp; Concise CTA Text</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The CTA message/text needs to be strong, concise, and emotional. Due to the lack of space in the e-learning UX design, we must use only a few words to explain to the user what is about to happen once they click on the CTA. Additionally, the CTA text cannot be too commercial. For an eLearning website, the message must excite and encourage the users, not make them wary of another commercial gimmick.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">III. Make The Destination Obvious</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to CTA placement, the main rule is the rule of no surprises. The users want to be taken to the expected pages. Taking them to any other page or another website will not be satisfying. And that’s why we make the CTA text strong yet obvious to understand so that the user knows what will happen when they click on the button.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">D. Integrating Valuable Features &amp; Functionalities</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last but not least we come to the matter of features and functionality. The right feature contributes to the conversion-focused website design a lot more than anyone can anticipate. To go head to head with your competitors, you must have the most essential features that make the experience on the site positive. Here&#8217;s a list of features that our web and <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/custom-software-development/">custom software developers</a> suggest enhancing the conversion of the eLearning platform –</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Basic Profile Creation &amp; Management Feature</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first and most important of all the basic features are the profile creation and management options. With this specific feature element of effective e-learning design, the users can create a personal profile on the platform, add and edit information, and manage easily. To use this feature the users can either make use of email and password, or they can sign up using any social platform.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Gamified Experience</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Small animations, colors, and micro-interactions- all are part of the gamified experience. Such small elements of design make the learning activities even more engaging and compel the users to carry on using the platform. Along with improving the e-learning platform ergonomic design, it also enhances conversion in large numbers.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">III. Data/Progress Analysis</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The data/progress analysis feature helps the learners online to understand how well their learning practices on the platform are going and how much they need to improve. The comprehensive database dashboard design for e-learning systems holds all kinds of analytical information about the user’s activities on the platform – from how many hours they have spent on the platform learning to final evaluation. This single feature will enhance the efficiency of learning on the platform a lot more and ensure conversion.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">IV. Accessibility Option</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accessibility goes a long way to convert consumers to your platform. Even within the target audience, there will be many users with specific needs. Through accessibility features, we create a high-quality e-learning platform ergonomic design, that enhances the user experience on the platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accessibility features such as language support, image alt text, video subtitles, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/dark-mode-in-web-design/">website dark mode</a>, all these features may seem simple, but make a big difference for many users out there. And that’s how through conversion-focused eLearning website design we ensure that every learner’s needs are taken care of on the eLearning platform.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Are You Ready To Follow The eLearning Design Path To Success?</h2>

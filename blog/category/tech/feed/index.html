										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="id_1">Introduction</h2>
<p>The entire gamut of business went through turmoil as soon as the pandemic hit the globe. However, amidst all these, the business world has also undergone some remarkable, unseen, and positive changes. Entrepreneurship picked up, remote work culture became the new normal, E-commerce scaled newer heights and what not! And all these have been possible due to the huge digital transformation that has been happening over the last few decades or basis the need that evolved due to the recent pandemic.</p>
<p>Well, when it&#8217;s about digital transformation, the telecom industry proved to be one sector that not only sparked the revolution, but has also been the flag bearer since long time now. To note here, telecom industry has almost become a synonym to this digital shift.</p>
<p>But then, this trajectory shift in digital space is the outcome of facing unknown or unheard challenges, overcoming them, and finally building robust technologies to bring in a digital revolution. In this blog, let&#8217;s have a look at some of the greatest challenges faced by the telecom industry and how it overcame them while maneuvering this remarkable <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/what-is-digital-transformation/">digital transformation</a> in real-time.</p>
<h2 id="id_2">Challenges of Implementing Digital Transformation in Telecom Industry:</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge #1: Super Fast and Responsive Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>While customers don’t like to wait in queues, customer service providers were not able to handle or respond to the large volumes of calls they received. Attending such humungous amount of calls and responding to them required large number of human resources, which again made the process cost-ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>Solution #1: Putting Artificial Intelligence (AI) Into Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>As a technology, AI has been developing competencies in telecoms. AI has changed the old school ways of attending customers, handling their queries, resolving them, and boosts customer engagement.</p>
<p>These days, businesses are focusing more to become an omni-channel contact centre platform software platform. Telecom industry is putting AI into customer service and engagement to make this happen across all levels. Virtual customer assistant, chatbots, and other AI powered tools are best examples of how telecom industry is making digital transformation a reality in today’s world.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #2: Handle Complex Business Processes</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13551" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-13551" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1.jpg" alt="Handle Complex Business Processes" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1.jpg 640w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Handle-Complex-Business-Processes-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13551" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Business processes usually get more complex with the high influx of data. As the data flowing in spike up, processing them or extracting information out of them gets more complex. With only human computing abilities, handling this enormous amount of data is near to impossible. And once data is lost, businesses start losing their growth and revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Solution #2: Machine Learning to Automate Businesses</strong></p>
<p>Automating businesses was one of the greatest digital transformations in telecom industry. Here, Machine Learning (ML) initiated developing competencies in telecoms by empowering machines to learn on their own over time and process massive amount of data in no time. Furthermore, by developing advanced ML algorithms, telecom industry brought in a new digital transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #3: Rise in Remote Working Culture</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13552" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-13552" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture-300x246.jpg" alt="Remote Working Culture" width="300" height="246" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture-300x246.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Remote-Working-Culture.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13552" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Remote working is the new normal and there is no denial about this! However, with the advent of this new normal, organizations started facing a new set of challenge &#8211; how to build a centralized work model wherein data can be made accessible to every employees, how to stay in sync with the employees sitting across different locations, or how to build a connection between employees and their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Solution#3: Introducing Cloud Hosted Telephony Solutions</strong></p>
<p>With these cloud hosted telephony solutions, organizations can now easily build a centralized data storage that can be managed and accessed from anywhere in world. Also, since data is stored in the cloud, it became easier for organizations to build a seamless human-device connection. By investing more on this cloud-hosted telephony solutions, service providers are bringing in a massive digital transformation in the telecom market.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #4: Rise of OTT (Over the Top) Platforms</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_13547" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13547" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13547 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms.jpg" alt="Rise of OTT (Over the Top) Platforms" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms.jpg 640w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rise-of-OTT-Over-the-Top-Platforms-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13547" class="wp-caption-text">Source: unsplash.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>OTT platforms started growing exponentially since last decade, thanks to the smart phone revolution! The arrival of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Netflix, and others have affected the telecom sector in infinites ways. As a result, revenue generation in telecom market started dipping largely.</p>
<p><strong>Solution#4: Develop Advanced Digital Content Delivery Network</strong></p>
<p>Another milestone digital transformation in telecom market is the development of networks to deliver digital content. Telcos adhered to the rise of OTT platforms and started building cloud hosted telephony solutions through which digital content be distributed via high-speed broadband or Wi-Fi, or even through mobile data packs.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #5: Old School Legacy Systems</strong></p>
<p>Legacy systems are traditional systems are either outdated or can no longer support the objectives of a business. Legacy systems proved to be one of the most challenging factors in the overall digital transformation of businesses. You can read more <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-fsi-legacy-systems-and-modernization.pdf">Legacy Systems</a></p>
<p><strong>Solution#5: Modernizing Legacy Systems</strong></p>
<p>The modernization of legacy systems is yet another remarkable digital transformation in telecom industry. The process requires reviewing and updating business requirements, which leads to assessing all the existing codes. Following this, advanced systems are developed to optimize overall operation and performance of a business. Even though this is quite a complex process, it ensures a high ROI to businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online shopping has become a common practice around the world. But the significance of ecommerce future trends have come to the forefront especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. When quarantine and work-from-home became the new normal in 2020, businesses and emerging ecommerce companies had no choice but to go digital. This has contributed to e-commerce’s share of global retail trade from 14% in 2019 to about 17% in 2020.</span> (source: <a href="https://unctad.org/news/how-covid-19-triggered-digital-and-e-commerce-turning-point">Unctad</a>)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to research by Statista, e-commerce’s share of total retail sales in the US surged from 11% in 2019 to 14% in 2020. Since then, there has been no turning back for these businesses.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13428 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-924x1024.jpg" alt="e-commerce’s share of total retail sales" width="924" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-924x1024.jpg 924w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-271x300.jpg 271w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-768x851.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01-1387x1536.jpg 1387w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/emerging-ecommerce-trends-blog-inside-image-01.jpg 1671w" sizes="(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="id_1">1. Taking Your E-Commerce Game Up a Notch</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With new trends enhancing e-commerce, online <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/customer-experience-design-secrets/">customer experience</a> (CX) and store engagement have become intimately tied to business outcomes. Customers have high standards and have become particular regarding their expectations from brands. So, if your website is not appealing, 38% of users will stop engaging with your content.</span> (Source: <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/compelling-stats-website-design-optimization-list">Hubspot</a>)</p>
<h3>So, how should you build a robust website/apps that also converts?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We at SCS INFO have helped our clients to digitally transform themselves using the best practices while staying ahead of the competition. To know more, please see our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/">ecommerce website development services</a> (web/apps, saas development) &#8211; 1200+ solutions delivered for small and medium businesses, funded startups, enterprises, and Fortune 500 clients globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To augment your website’s UX+CX and achieve your business goals across all the stages of the customer journey i.e. from lead generation to conversion, customer engagement and loyalty, we have listed some b2b e-commerce trends:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR to Boost Customer Experience (CX)</strong> &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital platforms are using augmented reality to empower consumers’ shopping experience. Now, shoppers can get a preview of products and services in real-time through the ‘try on’ or ‘view’ feature. </span>The beauty and cosmetic industry is leveraging the power of augmented reality (AR) to transform the e-shopping experience. With the help of AR, consumers can virtually full-fill makeup applications to mimic how they would try cosmetics on at a traditional brick and mortar store.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> – With the help of AI, companies can deliver hyper-personalized and enriching customer experiences.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are two of the most powerful AI powered ecommerce future trends that can skyrocket your top of the funnel (TOF):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Voice Commerce Powering CX</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Why type when you could easily voice your query? If an e-commerce store does not have a digital assistant, this can be a major drop-off point for users. They will get tired of typing out their queries as it slows down their shopping experience. An Emarketer survey revealed that 40% of internet users in the US use voice search. Evidently, businesses can leverage the ‘voice-to-cart’ technology to boost a website’s engagement rate and sales.</span></li>
<li><b>Customer Service Chatbots</b> &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer assistance chatbots can really help to convert visitors into customers. Like in-store salespeople, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/chatbot-can-use-business/">chatbots help consumers</a> complete their purchase and offer after-sales support. This is a way for businesses and emerging e-commerce companies to communicate with customers (including communication using regional languages) and resolve their issues then and there. In fact, 40% of millennials say that they use chatbots daily as they provide answers instantly.</span> (Source: <a href="https://www.slicktext.com/blog/2020/04/chatbot-statistics/">Slicktext</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Big Data for Personalized Experience</strong>&#8211; Online stores do not have retail salespeople to recommend products or answer shoppers’ queries. That is why it is crucial to have human touchpoints in a customer’s journey on e-commerce platforms. To mimic a user&#8217;s personalized in-store experience, online retailers are extracting customers’ information through their social media, browsing behavior, and prior buying patterns. Successful e-commerce brands are leveraging analytics to make UX data-driven and target consumers with exactly what they desire and even more.</li>
<li><b>Headless Commerce: A Solution to Increase Sales</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headless commerce is the separation of the front end i.e. the marketplace, user interface, graphics from the back-end that manages the product details and the portal&#8217;s entire functioning. This allows e-commerce website development companies being more creative, allowing freedom and flexibility to offer unique and personalized services to customers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8vZbbsCbVU8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2 id="id_2">2. Conclusion: E-Commerce UX Trends Are Here to Stay</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging ecommerce future trends have gained a lot of traction in 2021 already, driving more traffic to businesses and converting them into potential customers. The pandemic has made us realize how powerful e-commerce is. In fact, it is predicted by Nasdaq that by 2040, 95% of purchases will be through e-commerce platforms.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="id_1"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Extended Reality (XR) has transformed how humans interact with technology. What life will be like in the next 10 years is truly beyond our imagination.</span> From real-time 3D games, online shopping experience to weather forecasting, extended reality technology has grown exponentially. <span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Extended reality’ (XR) is really an umbrella term that describes a host of digital and physical experiences. </span>It includes technologies like AR, VR, MR and CR<span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is interesting to note that </span>the market size of XR is estimated to touch $209 billion by 2022, which is 8 times of what it was back in 2020<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> (Source: <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/extended-reality-xr/">Visual Capitalist</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To know more about how each of these technologies affect businesses, we have conducted an in-depth research for you<span style="font-weight: 400;">.&lt;/sp</span></p>
<h2 id="id_2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. What is Virtual Reality (VR)? | Utility of Virtual Reality  &#8211; Virtual Games &amp; Others</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VR is an immersive, visual and sound-based experience using computer-generated simulations. Therefore, true to its name, virtual reality technology makes you feel like you&#8217;re in a different world. Users can experience this ‘pretend’ world with devices like virtual reality headsets and goggles.</span></p>
<p>The sounds, visuals, and sensations that create this virtual environment are developed by computer softwares. So, VR will shut out the real world and transport you to an imaginary world within the comfort of your own room<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Besides VR games, this technology is also used for training in the medical field, army and sports.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. What is Augmented Reality (AR)?</span></h2>
<p>While VR is an immersive experience, AR technology blends virtual objects with our reality. It keeps the real world central while augmenting it with digital elements.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up, did you ever wonder what it would feel like to experience Harry Potter in real time? Today, companies have developed AR games where gamers can immerse themselves in a pre-created world that is superimposed over a real-world environment. So now, Harry Potter fans can experience the wizarding world anywhere, in their own time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, most brands use AR in marketing strategies to personalise customer experiences on digital platforms. (Source: <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2020/12/11/the-benefits-augmented-reality-marketing">The Drum</a>)</span></p>
<h2 id="id_4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. What is Mixed Reality Technology: A Blend of AR &amp; VR</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name suggests, Mixed Reality is somewhere in between VR and AR. It lets you immerse yourself and interact with an imaginary world with one foot in the real world. </span>Some common examples of MR would be Snapchat filters and the famous Pokemon Go game that had taken the world by storm in 2016.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While AR is completely screen-based, MR connects you to the mixed reality portal. This lets you experience the virtual world within the comfort of your own home. According to statistics, AR glasses (also used in MR technology) sales worldwide is going to increase from 410 thousand units in 2021 to 3.9 million units in 2024. (Source: </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/610496/smart-ar-glasses-shipments-worldwide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, MR will become a powerful tool to solve business problems and improve accuracy of operations. </span>A great example of mixed reality would be the healthcare sector. The MR technology will be adopted to train surgeons through surgery simulations to improve surgical accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="id_5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. The Concept of ‘Cinematic Reality’</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unknown Florida-based tech company called Magic Leaps had first introduced the concept of cinematic reality (CR). The firm had raised over half a billion dollars from Google and other investors. The idea behind this technology was to </span>provide users with a cinematic 3D experience in 360 degrees and immersive audio. Unlike VR, when users wear the CR goggles, they will have a cinematic experience but won’t have control over the virtual setting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the entertainment industry is still exploring this technology. (</span><a href="https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/reality-vs-cinematic-reality/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: Premium Beat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span>Filmmakers consider CR to be a great tool for storytelling<span style="font-weight: 400;"> which will help to advance filming and movie production techniques. </span></p>
<h2 id="id_6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Conclusion: XR is Changing the World</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extended reality is evolving rapidly and shifting the entire course of our future. </span>Although companies are still exploring the various XR technologies, they have already started implementing AR, VR and MR. Such immersive technologies are problem solving, efficient and cost-effective, generating higher revenue in the process.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get ready for XR to completely change your life in the next couple of years. You’ll see the technology conquering domains like healthcare, customer engagement, employee training, aerospace and countless others.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of the web is evolving, and web 3.0 is here to reconstruct online business success metrics. And if you are wondering what is web 3.0, then this piece is just for you.</p>
<p>The web as we experience today is known as web 2.0, aka, the social web. It enables us to consume content from various sources, and then create our own content for the others out there. It is an open conversation between us and the world out there. And in this conversation both sides able to speak to each other freely.</p>
<p>However, a revolution is on the way. Foregoing the search and data-related challenges of web 2.0, there’s a new web that’s knocking on the door. If we do the comparison of web 2.0 vs web 3.0, we’ll see that the latter promises a smarter, fairer, and smoother web experience to the users.</p>
<p>But what do these promises mean for your business website?</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: justify;">1. History Of Web Transformation</h2>
<p>To design websites for web 3.0, we must understand what web 3.0 is. And for that, we need to start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Remember the olden websites where all you could do was read texts? Such websites came with minimal graphic and interactive elements. All we could do was to consume the information presented to us, and perhaps share it through limited means. This age of the web is also known as the library web or web 1.0.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13345" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13345 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1024x567.png" alt="craigslist homepage screenshot" width="1024" height="567" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1024x567.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-300x166.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-768x425.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image.png 1263w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13345" class="wp-caption-text">Source: craigslist</figcaption></figure>
<p>But after some time web 1.0 was not enough. We wanted a streamlined manner of information sharing, creating our content, and sharing it with the world. We wanted the websites to think about us when crafting content, and designing the website. Demand for personalization, better connectivity, and more interaction took over the internet. And that’s how we got web 2.0, a.k.a, the social web. But now after almost 2 decades, we are ready to transition into the web 3.0 world, and people are already making all kinds of web 2.0 vs web 3.0 comparisons to understand which one is better.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13346" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13346" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13346 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1-1024x559.png" alt="flickr homepage screenshot" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1-1024x559.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1-300x164.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1-768x419.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1.png 1281w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13346" class="wp-caption-text">Source: flickr</figcaption></figure>
<p>And now the artificial intelligence technologies have pushed us towards the evolution of web 3.0. The term web 3.0, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/business/12web.html">coined first by John Markoff in his 2006 NY times article</a> denotes a new age of the online world. The concept is dominated by the implication of AI and machine learning usage. Additionally, the concept also makes use of p2p networks to provide a transparent user experience.</p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: justify;">2. What Is Web 3.0: The Definition</h2>
<p>So what is web 3.0 exactly? There may not be a set definition yet. But after considering its parameters, we have created a basic level definition explaining web 3.0 in a nutshell.</p>
<p><i>“Web 3.0 is an AI/machine learning-driven web that will provide the users with relevant, relatable, and valuable search results based on the context of their search, and not just the keywords. Additionally, This web is also aimed to eliminate data monopoly with the implementation of decentralized systems like blockchain and protect the user data from being misused.”</i></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13348 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-938x1024.jpg" alt="what is web 3.0" width="938" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-938x1024.jpg 938w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-275x300.jpg 275w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-768x839.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-1407x1536.jpg 1407w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-01-1876x2048.jpg 1876w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /></p>
<p>The debate about the current existence of web 3.0 is many. However, there’s one thing no one can disagree on, and that is the future impact of web 3.0 main features on web design. So let’s see what kind of design requirements your website needs to fulfill to fit into a web 3.0 future.</p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: justify;">3. Web 3.0 Design: A Complete Overview</h2>
<p>Now there remain one questions that need to be answered-</p>
<p>Is web 3.0 here?</p>
<p>How can your website fit into the new requirements of web 3.0? There are many answers to the first question, some more debatable than others. However, the consensus agrees that web 3.0 is indeed here, but at the very initial stage. The kind of decentralized and semantic web vision is still far from being achieved. But some features are already well implemented within our regular web experience.</p>
<p>As an experienced <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">web design company in Casablanca</a>, we are continuously working to create better and more successful design/development solutions. And that’s how we have unearthed some specific trends that will be necessary for your website’s success in the web 3.0 world. Here’s a comprehensive list of all of them-</p>
<h3>A. Designing For An AI-Driven Web</h3>
<p>By now, you must know what is web 3.0, and if you do, then you’d know that this concept depends heavily upon the use of AI and machine learning. So it is no wonder that in the future AI is going to have a bigger impact on design.</p>
<p>The aim is to create smoother and frictionless web designs that make the user experience free sailing. To design such a website, we need to begin with the right kind of data and a robust analytics system.</p>
<p>Using AI frameworks, designers and developers in the future will have a better idea of what kind of look and feel the target audience wants from the web 3.0 design trends. Based on various data points such as age, gender, location, profession, and many others, expert design agencies will be able to pinpoint the design requirements. The use of data to design an effective website is already a common practice. But in the future, it will be an industry standard.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13349 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-811x1024.jpg" alt="what is web 3.0" width="811" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-811x1024.jpg 811w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-238x300.jpg 238w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-768x969.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-1217x1536.jpg 1217w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-1623x2048.jpg 1623w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-02-scaled.jpg 2029w" sizes="(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px" /></p>
<p>We cannot speak about AI in web 3.0 website design without touching upon ADI, also known as Artificial Design Intelligence. Considered to be the scourge of web designers worldwide, we believe that ADI will see a boost shortly. But remember, ADI will not replace human designers. it is merely a tool that will streamline the design process.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Expert Thought: ADI systems are not the end for the designers. With ADI, web designers can reduce the amount of repetitive tasks they have to perform enabling them to create truly dynamic web designs that offer a better user experience.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>B. Optimizing The Website For Semantic Web</h3>
<p>If we are wondering about how will web 3.0 impact business, then we must consider the semantic web.</p>
<p>As web 3.0’s biggest USP, it will provide the users with more contextual search answers than the general keyword-based results. And to succeed in this kind of scenario, your <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/voice-user-interface-design/">website needs to be optimized well with smart voice search features</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13350 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-747x1024.jpg" alt="what is semantic web 3.0" width="747" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-747x1024.jpg 747w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-219x300.jpg 219w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-768x1053.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-1120x1536.jpg 1120w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-1494x2048.jpg 1494w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-03-scaled.jpg 1867w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></p>
<p>For example- when we use the word &#8216;mustang&#8217; on a search engine we get results mostly related to Ford Mustang, the famous car. But mustang also happens to be an animal. The semantic web will be able to understand the difference of context in the usage of keywords and provide relevant results.</p>
<p>Since the traditional search practices are changing rapidly. The users want the web to understand what they mean with their queries, rather than what their search query means. To accomplish that, our experts suggest using the extensive data sets on the target users, as well as structured data for web design 3.0.</p>
<p>AI-based data analytics features of web technology enable us to focus on the finer details of the end-users, understanding the context of their search activities better. For example, let’s think about an end-user who searches for a budget smartphone online. Having a finer insight into their phone usage, as in what kind of activities they perform the most with their phone will enable search engines to display phones that fit their activity perfectly.</p>
<p>Structured data is expected to be the key to the semantic web later in the future. It is a solution that is used to label data within a piece of content. This labeling practice enables search engines to understand data better and provide more contextual search results.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>C. A Changing Focus On Multimedia Content</h3>
<p>To keep up with the smart web, the search habits of the users will change as well. While previously the activity required the users to type out a search query in the browser search box, nowadays it is a lot easier. With simple voice search options, individuals can find what they are looking for online. And as an experienced <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">web design &amp; development company</a>, we aim to match our client&#8217;s website content with this search habit accordingly.</p>
<p>From the time of web 2.0, content has been king. For the last couple of years, there has been a visible shift towards multimedia content, and the emergence of web 3.0 is going to accelerate that shift. This is because of three distinctive reasons-</p>
<p>i. To keep up with the voice search trend, the website content needs to be more dynamic, fitting the conversational tone of voice search queries.</p>
<p>ii. Multimedia content will become more important. Since people are always on the go, the web 3.0 design trends are leaning more towards audio and video content that is easy to consume anytime anywhere.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13352" style="width: 946px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13352 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-946x1024.jpg" alt="what is web 3.0" width="946" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-946x1024.jpg 946w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-277x300.jpg 277w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-768x831.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-1420x1536.jpg 1420w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-06-1893x2048.jpg 1893w" sizes="(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13352" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p>iii. Lastly, the ubiquity promised by web 3.0 will lead to more experience-based content on the websites. Since traditional content delivery is not possible through smart IoT devices, your website content must be optimized for an experience-based approach.</p>
<p>One of the many promised advantages of web 3.0 is an efficient web experience. And to fulfill those promises, your website content needs to be optimized perfectly. By using conversational tones, multimedia content, and enhancing the content experience on the website, you can improve consumer interaction on your website.</p>
<h3>D. AR/VR Augmentation: Building A Better Web Reality</h3>
<p>Those who know the answer to what is web 3.0, also know that AR/VR is going to be the driving force behind its success.</p>
<p>Despite being well known in the design sphere, augmented reality and virtual reality are still not being used enough. However, they will become essential design elements for web design 3.0. This application of AR/VR tech will improve the quality of experience-based interaction and transparency.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13353" style="width: 946px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13353 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-946x1024.jpg" alt="what is web 3.0" width="946" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-946x1024.jpg 946w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-277x300.jpg 277w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-768x831.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-1420x1536.jpg 1420w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/web-3.0-design-website-article-05-1893x2048.jpg 1893w" sizes="(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13353" class="wp-caption-text">Designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether your website is an up-and-coming eCommerce platform, a B2B vendor, or a lifestyle website- the use of AR/VR is going to take the experience to the next level. The additional piece of technology will enable the users to experience the product or service before they make their purchase. This ability will help them make far better and valuable decisions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the use of AR/VR will increase the transparency level of user interaction as well. When you give them an early look at a service they are supposed to acquire, they will be more assured of the quality of the service, and its value in their life. With this technology, your web 3.0 website will be better accessible through the internet of things devices.</p>

<h3>E. Web 3.0 &amp; Internet Of Things: A Ubiquitous Design</h3>
<p>One of the many qualities that distinguish Web 3.0 from the rest is its ubiquity. It is believed that when web 3.0 is finally here, we’ll be able to access the web from any place, anytime.</p>
<p>But we don’t have to wait for that. The ubiquitous aspect of web 3.0 is already here thanks to the internet of things. The connected devices, ranging from our laptops and phones to various household objects already enable us to connect to various services online. And to become part of this connected future, your site design needs to be updated for IoT.</p>
<p>When it comes to designing for IoT 3.0, a lot of the success depends on the user interface. Popular smart devices, such as smart hubs or smartwatches come with limited processing power. So in order to make the platform work on these devices, the user interface needs to be perfectly optimized. A faster and more agile design process coupled with the design best practices will be necessary to create a perfect user interface for it.</p>
<p>Lastly, a lot of IoT concerns are generally associated with the security aspect. Surely, with limited processing power, the device may not be very secure. Keeping that in mind, the partner web design company must take every security measure to ensure that the website doesn’t pose any extra threat to the user’s data security in any way.</p>
<h3>F. Chatbots Providing Extensive Semantic Web Support</h3>
<p>We have already discussed web 3.0 features like semantic web and its impact on web design. However, there’s another side to creating a semantic experience on the web and that is chatbots.</p>
<p>You probably already have a chatbot on the website, or might be planning to integrate one. Modern chatbots are of higher quality, able to provide plenty of information and help to the users. However, it is nowhere near close to what a human would be able to accomplish. And that’s why during the chatbot integration process, ensure that your partner web design &amp; development company uses the latest technology like GPT-3.</p>

<p>Generative Pre-trained transformer 3, also known as GPT-3 is an AI tool that has been pre-trained. It means that unlike traditional AI-based chatbots that learn as it goes- this text generation algorithm is already trained with the necessary data. It can create any content that has a language structure. This means that the use of such technology for the chatbot operation on your website will get you closer to making your website fit the web 3.0 standards.</p>
<h2>Web 3.0 Is Almost Here, There’s No Time To Wait Anymore!</h2>
<p>The answer to what is web 3.0 reveals that in the future, the web will be capable enough to guide us to find the right kind of search results for our queries. The highly sensitive, AI/ML-based web will enable a fairer web experience that is not riddled by the friction of the modern web. And to become a part of this frictionless web, your online business platform needs to change drastically.</p>
<p>To fit into this utopian world of the web, your website needs web 3.0 design trends. Leveraging the above-mentioned design and development aspects, you’ll have an easier time making the best of this next age of web revolution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, how long will it take to develop your software solution?</p>
<p>It is a question you must have asked your development partner at least once. And it is indeed, important for you to know how much time and money it will take to develop your custom solution.</p>
<p>Proper cost estimation in project management is the very soul of the development process. Everyone is aware of the importance of providing clear assessments to the clients. Both clients and development teams would agree that the benefits of this practice are many.</p>
<p>So if you are still wondering how long it will take to develop your software solution, read on. In the following paragraphs, we are about to discuss some crucial elements of project estimation, and our in-house process of project estimation, curated by the very best of our team.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: justify;">1. Agile Vs Traditional: A War Of Estimates</h2>
<p>Once, software developers did things more traditionally. The process started with the project manager mapping out the project plan, complete with all the tasks, dependencies, and assigned teammates. However, with the rise of the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile development manifesto</a> the software project estimation approach changed entirely.</p>
<p>Early project planning methods pinned down the scope of the project and let the development time and cost vary. Needless to say, this resulted in a flawed time and cost estimation for the project. And that&#8217;s why the estimating techniques for agile projects take the opposite approach. It pins down the time and cost of development within a set range and lets the scope of the project vary.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13309 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-888x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="888" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-888x1024.jpg 888w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-260x300.jpg 260w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-768x885.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-1332x1536.jpg 1332w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-1777x2048.jpg 1777w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></p>
<p>Rather than starting with a “Complete” idea of the project, the agile process begins with high-level scoping. This way we can learn more about the project, clarify our doubts, understand the core features, functionalities needed. This understanding further helps us to streamline the development process &amp; assign the right tech stack and experts.</p>
<p>Leaving the rigid and unchanging traditional estimation process behind, the modern method creates more room for success. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/">Our agile methods</a> for estimating project times and costs ensure that the assessment is done based on a concrete understanding of the project, and not simple assumptions. Additionally, this also provides the scope of the project to change and adapt to the changing business needs, promoting future growth for our clients.</p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Project Estimation For Software Development: A Game Of Benefits!</h2>
<p>Starting the development process with a clear idea of how much to invest is not just beneficial to the clients, but to us as well. It is a solid base of knowledge helping us to assess the kind of effort and expertise the product development process needs to be successful.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13310 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-888x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation benefits" width="888" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-888x1024.jpg 888w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-260x300.jpg 260w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-768x885.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-1332x1536.jpg 1332w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-1777x2048.jpg 1777w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></p>
<p>Let’s go through the below list of benefits to comprehend how the proper process of cost estimation in project management benefits both the clients and the developers-</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>A. It Increases Trust</h3>
<p>Trust is important for any kind of relationship, especially if it is a business relationship.</p>
<p>Imagine dealing with a development partner that does not provide you with a clear budget and cost estimation of a project. They don’t tell you how long it might take to build the solution and leave you completely in the dark.</p>
<p>Sounds horrible, doesn’t it? Imagine not knowing a single thing about the very important development project that will change the face of business. Such an experience does not increase any kind of trust in the development agency. On the other hand, a clear idea on project estimation is sure to increase trust between clients and developers. And that’s why <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">experienced web development agencies</a> always ensure that a proper assessment process is integral to the development project.</p>
<h3>B. Improves The Value Of The Project</h3>
<p>ROI or return on investment determines the value of any software. How much return are you going to get from your investment in the development? And an inaccurate answer to this question will seriously diminish the value of the project.</p>
<p>Additionally, a successful development project also results in improved experience and a better reputation in the industry. This is why a reliable project estimation is beneficial for both the clients and the development agencies. For one side, it provides real value, and ROI. And for the other side, it offers meaningful experience, expertise, and an improved relationship with the clients.</p>
<h3>C. Define And Meet Realistic Deadlines</h3>
<p>Imagine launching a marketing campaign for your latest customer-facing software, only to realize that development will take more time. Not only do you have to change a lot of decisions you made, but it will also impact your reputation in the market.</p>
<p>A bona fide agile project estimation process enables development teams to understand the scope of the project and then set a realistic deadline. Starting with the initial analysis of the proposal, we begin scoping out the features, functionalities, user stories &amp; tech stack before finally predicting a range of timelines. This kind of deadline is realistic and much easier to meet.</p>
<h3>D. Encourages Faster Result</h3>
<p>It is an established truth that reliable IT project cost estimation techniques make development faster. Following the agile methodology, the project requirements are broken down and prioritized for the sprint plan creation.</p>
<p>It is more feasible for the developers to build a meaningful product with a comprehensive sprint plan. They can focus on the essential elements of development first, and ensure that those elements work perfectly for the clients. This way we can deliver a successful product a lot faster,</p>
<h3>E. Help Clients Make Better Business Decisions</h3>
<p>Imagine going grocery shopping with a fixed budget for every product on your list. And then when you get there, you realize that the price of one essential product on the list has increased. To accommodate that, you now have to eliminate one of the other grocery items on the list. This can be easily done since we are only talking about groceries. But such decisions are not easy to make when it comes to your business.</p>
<p>You can’t get rid of a business process as easy as scratching off ketchup from the grocery list. Just because you have to get a <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/custom-software-development/">custom software solution</a>, or a website developed doesn’t mean you can let other aspects of the business suffer. And that’s why you require the proper project cost estimation and budgeting. This way you’ll know exactly how to allocate resources throughout the business, and make smart choices that do not hinder the business growth.</p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: justify;">3. A Straightforward Project Estimation: Unified’s Own Process</h2>
<p>Knowing the time and cost range for the project’s development will streamline strategic business decision-making processes for you. Whether you are a start-up entrepreneur or an established businessman entering the tech world- knowing how much to invest and what to expect as ROI is the key to success. So how to estimate project cost and time? Here’s Unified Infotech&#8217;s very own process explained in brief for you.</p>
<h3>A. Beginning With A Basic Estimation</h3>
<p>Any cost and time estimation in project management provided without a clear idea of the project is irrelevant. However, the clients need a basic model before they begin a partnership with us. And that’s why our estimation process begins with a fundamental assessment of the initial proposal.</p>
<p>Based on the client&#8217;s initial requirement, our sales team consults with the development expert and provides clients with a base level time &amp; cost estimation. This estimation is never too far from how much it will actually take to develop the solution. However, it is still an initial estimation based only on the basic idea of the project. There will be some changes to this estimate during the later stages.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Exclusive insight: This estimate is never the same for two projects. Based on various factors, such as specific requirements, project type, design expectations, core functionalities, and many others, the basic estimation varies widely. This is done to ensure that every product we develop is completely relevant to the clients, and is successful in fulfilling its goals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>B. Discovery &amp; Planning: Solidifying The Estimation Base</h3>
<p>With the client on board and the kick-off phase completed, we begin our discovery and planning phase. This phase is also when we validate all the project cost, time &amp; effort estimation done so far.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13311 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-894x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="894" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-894x1024.jpg 894w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-262x300.jpg 262w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-768x879.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-1342x1536.jpg 1342w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-1789x2048.jpg 1789w" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px" /></p>
<p>The basic estimate provided by the sales team is already assessed once during the high-level scope of the pre-kick-off process. It is based on the deliverables determined through the collaboration between the client and the team. Next up comes a more detailed estimation stage where we put the details of the deliverables on the discussion board. From there, our project managers measure the effort and hours necessary for development.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of how the estimation process goes down during the discovery and planning process.</p>
<h4>I. Understanding The Basic Objective</h4>
<p>The purpose of this step is to understand the project well enough before moving in with the detailed analysis of the process. Additionally, it also enables us to complete the thorough E1 estimation that is a more precise version of the initial software project estimation plan.</p>
<p>During this, we aim to understand all the deliverables, validate the information we have till now, and clarify any additional doubts and questions. Once the high-level deliverables are clarified, we move on to the next step that is epic mapping.</p>
<h4>II. User Story &amp; Epic Mapping</h4>
<p>Epic mapping and user stories are essential parts of our E1 estimation methodology. The epic is a larger component that we can break into smaller user stories. User Stories on the other hand are informal explanations of different features written from the point of view of the users.</p>
<p>As higher-level functionalities, epics contain multiple smaller user stories. For example- in the image below, the user goals each represent an epic. To achieve these goals, the users would need to perform the activities listed as user activities. However, each person would perform the same activity differently, as demonstrated in the image.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13312 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-554x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation user story" width="554" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-554x1024.jpg 554w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-162x300.jpg 162w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-768x1419.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-831x1536.jpg 831w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-1108x2048.jpg 1108w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-scaled.jpg 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /></p>
<p>The epic mapping essentially breaks down the deliverables into smaller units enabling the team to understand what components are needed to build the solution. Once it has been finalized by both the internal team members and the client, the project manager begins the E1 estimation of the effort/size of the process. This estimation is done based on the tech stack. The hours and story points decided in this phase are as per the company baseline, and the industry standards. The range of hours in the E1 estimate also includes buffer time that is important for the successful completion of the project in time.</p>
<p>Once the E1 phase is done, the project manager reviews the effort &amp; cost estimation, and then sends it to the rest of the management team. Any differences between the initial estimate and the E1 estimates are documented and analyzed.<i></i></p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Exclusive insight: While creating a more detailed user story mapping, one of the major goals of the Business Analyst follows is to not let the details increase the estimate. However, in case the estimates increase due to the details, the Project manager must take care of the estimates accordingly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>C. Imbibing Accuracy With E2 Estimation</h3>
<p>To be exact in estimating project management, we take a look back at the estimate once again during the pre-development &amp; planning stage.</p>
<p>The E2 estimation reflects any changes made in the time and effort predicted within the previous estimates. During the pre-development process, our team aims to complete some basic tasks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13313 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-894x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="894" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-894x1024.jpg 894w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-262x300.jpg 262w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-768x879.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-1342x1536.jpg 1342w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-1789x2048.jpg 1789w" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px" /></p>
<p>The defined and finalized story point and team efficiency help determine the accurate range of development hours. This finalized software development project cost estimation is then verified by the assigned developers and TLs. Once it is approved by the internal team, the project release plan is sent to the clients.</p>
<p>The project release plan includes crucial information on the release of each spring and the amount of payment for them. We follow this estimation throughout the development with minimal to no deviation whatsoever.</p>

<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: justify;">4. Lastly, Some Best Practices To Keep In Mind</h2>
<p>It is not always possible to be super organized during the development and project estimation process. Project scopes evolve, business requirement changes, markets turn 180 degrees on their head, and client preferences change as well. Amid all this chaos, the development agency you partner up with must follow a well-established set of project management estimation best practices. What are they, you wonder? Well, here’s a list-</p>
<h3>A. Honesty/Clarity About The Figures</h3>
<p>Honesty and clarity are the most important thing when it comes to project estimation. How else can we gain the trust of the clients?</p>
<p>Our estimates are based on concrete knowledge of the project, as well as the complete idea of all the requirements, such as tech stack, third-party components, and internal resources necessary. By providing an honest estimation to the clients, we enable them for future growth and build a longer-lasting relationship with them.</p>
<h3>B. Setting Clear Assumptions</h3>
<p>While it might be possible for the development teams in the movies to build an impossible amount of deliverables within a short amount of time, it is not the case for real-world developers. In real-life scenarios, client preferences change, markets change, and a lot of other things might delay or hamper the development process.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13314 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-934x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="934" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-934x1024.jpg 934w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-274x300.jpg 274w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-768x842.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-1401x1536.jpg 1401w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-1869x2048.jpg 1869w" sizes="(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" /></p>
<p>And that’s why the second cost estimation best practice we follow is setting clear assumptions. We neither overestimate nor underestimate a project scope. Considering a proposal from a real-world perspective, we set a clear picture of how the development process will be like to the clients. This provides them with a clear idea of the investment amount, as well as the future ROI.</p>

<h3>C. Consider All The Risks</h3>
<p>Beginning a project without considering all the risks first is an act of hubris. Our software project estimation process includes detailed risk consideration and management planning. This plan ensures that in case of any challenges arising, we can mitigate it before it impacts the project or our clients negatively.</p>
<h2>Despite The Estimation Challenges, We Always Aim To Rise To The Occasion!</h2>
<p>Due to the multiple variables, it is not easy to pin down a project estimation that is 100% accurate. However, with a clear idea of the project, as well as utilizing our decade of experience, we can assess the projects well and provide meaningful insight into how many the clients would need to invest.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, do you know how much YOU need to invest in your project? Why not give us a </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/about/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shout-out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">What does it take to design an eLearning website?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not a lot! Certainly, the crowded market suggests that it is fairly easy to design and develop an eLearning website without much fuss. Although, the popularity of eLearning solutions, has made it hard to break into the market, and that&#8217;s why for the success of the platform, you need an e-learning platform ergonomic design that drives conversion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ergonomic is relating to the human factor of design, and conversion-driven design relates to business success. Combined, these two can take your eLearning website to the next level. So let&#8217;s discuss exactly how to transform your platform from being mediocre to one of the best in the industry!</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. Ergonomics &amp; Conversion-Focused Design: Why Are They Important For eLearning?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The steady growth of eLearning popularity increased when the pandemic hit. During the lockdown, about <a href="https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse">1.2 billion children</a> in 186 countries faced challenges when the schools were shut down. Besides the schoolchildren, numerous college students and employees in training also faced the same impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13285 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-775x1024.jpg" alt="eLearning statistic" width="775" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-775x1024.jpg 775w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-227x300.jpg 227w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-768x1015.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-1162x1536.jpg 1162w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-1549x2048.jpg 1549w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-01-scaled.jpg 1937w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To cope with this, educational institutes and corporates expanded their online training initiatives. And now it seems that this expansion is going to be permanent. Almost all learning services are not searching for solutions to <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-build-e-learning-website-like-udemy/">build websites like Udemy</a> to better accommodate their students. To leverage this growing opportunity, you must understand the importance of ergonomics and conversion for the success of your e-learning platform design.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. e-Learning Platform Ergonomic Design: Why Is It Necessary?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are many reasons why ergonomics design and technology will be important for your eLearning platform&#8217;s future.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At this point, we all know that online learning is here to stay. Soon enough, there will be a sharp spike in the number of new online learners. And a lot of them might be unfamiliar with the inner-workings of eLearning platforms. To accommodate these new users, the application of the e-learning platform ergonomic design is going to be essential.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13286 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-983x1024.jpg" alt="e-learning platform ergonomic design" width="983" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-983x1024.jpg 983w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-288x300.jpg 288w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-768x800.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-1474x1536.jpg 1474w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-02-1965x2048.jpg 1965w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, we also have teachers who are facing the new challenges of switching from offline classrooms to online teaching. Most of these challenges are relating to the design and functionality of the platforms. With human tech ergonomic design guidelines, you can offer the teachers/instructors a better platform enabling them to offer the best of education to their students. The application of ergonomics on the eLearning platform is going to make the user&#8217;s lives a lot easier.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Conversion-Focused Design: Why You Must Pay Attention To It?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Conversion is the key to business success, and design happens to be the key to conversion. An ordinary user is not going to be aware of what goes on on the development end. They will only see the website, and its interface and decide whether they are going to spend time there or not. And that’s why investing in conversion-focused <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/website-design/">web design</a> is going to be crucial for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the color palette to the content hierarchy, everything will contribute to the visitor conversion. And to create an effective platform, you must optimize the design of the platform to match the latest conversion techniques in the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ergonomics and conversion-centric design are not matters of choice anymore. To succeed in a congested market full of various eLearning solutions, these attributes of design will give you a competitive edge. And that’s why to help you out, our in-house design experts have crafted the below guides that talk about how to optimize the e-learning UX design accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Designing For eLearning: Our Ergonomic Process</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Web design ergonomic is not a static practice. It is ever-evolving with the audience, platforms, and new trends. However, there are certain things about this scientific discipline that remain unchanged-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">E-learning platform ergonomic design serves as the point where the human factor meets the machine. It is the mix between human-ness and machine design, despite the form it takes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ergonomic elements of effective e-learning design must be usable and useful to the target audience. Any design that’s not easy to use and useful to the end consumer is not ergonomic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And last but not the least, ergonomic design will always give you a competitive edge in the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With these in mind, here are some ways our design team integrates ergonomics on eLearning designs-</p>

</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Understanding The Users: Where Ergonomics Start!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The user is where it starts from.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For a human factors ergonomics design, our process begins with understanding the users. When it comes to the human factor in design, opinions change based on the age, profession, and intention of the users. Someone who is only trying to enhance their skill is not going to have similar kind of design needs compared to a school student who is using an online platform. And that’s why we have to pay extra attention to the matter of target users while designing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13287 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-828x1024.jpg" alt="e-learning ergonomic design" width="828" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-828x1024.jpg 828w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-243x300.jpg 243w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-768x949.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-1243x1536.jpg 1243w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-03-1657x2048.jpg 1657w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what kind of target demographic does your eLearning platform serve? Let us take a look at the two basic groups of online learners you might encounter-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Generic Learners</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most eLearning sites serve the group of generic learners. These are independent and individual learners who are looking to learn something new on their own time. Some want to brush up on an old skill, while some want to complete a certification course on any professional skills. These users prefer the asynchronous learning module that gives them the freedom to learn on their own without the traditional education-related restrictions.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Expert speaks: Asynchronous learning is one of the main reasons why online learning has seen such a rise in popularity. And that’s why it is one of the offerings you must consider for your eLearning platform as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Learners With Set Goals</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The second kind of users is students and employees who are using eLearning platforms for school education and workplace training. They often prefer group learning sessions with synchronous learning systems. Additionally, these users are more likely to be using proprietary platforms of their institutes or companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Both groups of learners have unique requirements that the eLearning platform must fulfill. And that’s why we collect all kinds of information and data before beginning our ergonomic design process</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Keeping Up With Cognitive Ergonomic Demands With Design Psychology</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Knowing the users beforehand gives us a clear understanding of their cognitive demands from the platform. And this helps us to decide on the right application of design psychology best practices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13288 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-1024x1017.jpg" alt="e-learning platform ergonomic design" width="1024" height="1017" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-1024x1017.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-300x298.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-768x763.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-1536x1526.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-04-2048x2035.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cognitive ergonomics on the eLearning platform is necessary to pay attention to. This attribute of the website helps users to think, reason, read and make decisions easily without much stress. It enhances the overall e-learning platform ergonomic design experience, enabling users to obtain and retain information with ease.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a few design psychology rules we use to improve the matter of cognitive ergonomics during the e-learning platform design process-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Hick’s Law:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hick&#8217;s law is a psychological law that focuses on how long it takes for a person to make a decision based on the number of available choices. According to this, the more choices a person has in front of them, the harder time they will have in making one decision. This hardship, needless to say, will repel the user from the platform, and they will opt for some other website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13289 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-1024x1017.jpg" alt="e-learning platform ergonomic design" width="1024" height="1017" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-1024x1017.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-300x298.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-768x763.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-1536x1526.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-05-2048x2035.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As an experienced e-learning software development company, we make use of this law to ease the experience on the platform. For example, when they are searching for a certain course, rather than bombarding them with all the courses available, we provide them with a well-sorted list. This list enables them to change the type and filter suggestions as well. This approach makes navigating the courses list easy, and reduces chances of overwhelming the users.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Negative Space</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Learning is already a hard process for many out there. and that’s why to rest their eyes and prevent getting overwhelmed, we must integrate ample white space on the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The use of space between different design elements and content on the page is ideal to give the user’s eyes a bit of rest while they are consuming information and learning at a fast rate. This not only provides them with some breathing room but also improves the quality of education they receive on the site. The law of negative space is one of the major laws to imbibe cognitive ergonomic factors in design.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">III. The Von Restorff Effect</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mainly used for CTA placements, this law can also enhance the cognitive ergonomic factor on the eLearning website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13290 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-1024x1017.jpg" alt="e-learning ergonomic design" width="1024" height="1017" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-1024x1017.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-300x298.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-768x763.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-1536x1526.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-06-2048x2035.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the Von Restorff effect in e-learning UX design, we draw user attention to particular areas on the webpage. Whether it is a next slide button, or an important part of the text on the article, with this effect we can highlight the specific area the user needs to pay attention to and enhance their learning experience.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">IV. Color Psychology</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Color has always had a unique impact on the human psyche. And that’s why the use of color psychology is given ample importance in our design process. Keeping up with the brand consistency, we make use of colors that energizes and motivates the learners to keep on using the service to acquire more information and expand their knowledge. The use of brighter hues throughout the e-learning app and web UI makes the overall experience more soothing and encouraging.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">V. Typography</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">eLearning websites happen to be content-heavy. The presence of various articles, PDFs, slides, and videos (preferably with subtitles) makes it necessary for us to approach the matter of typography carefully.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rather than using fancy and hard-to-read fonts, we make use of fonts that are easy to read and are soothing to the eyes. this practice of ours helps the users to understand the text quickly. Typography also happens to be one of the most important parts of e-learning architecture design, so we ensure perfection when choosing the hierarchy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Creating Consistency And Imbibing Simplicity</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Design consistency and simplicity are the major criteria to fulfill when it comes to the ergonomic design of the eLearning site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">eLearning websites that are designed simply and consistently make for a better learner experience on the site. This approach of ours reduces the amount of time learners spend on the onboarding process. Additionally, it also helps them to focus on the task at hand and doesn&#8217;t surprise them with new design inconsistencies every time they log in.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some of our strategies for imbibing consistency and simplicity within your e-learning platform ergonomic design-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Navigational Consistency</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Navigational consistency stands at the forefront of our human factors-based ergonomics design process. by offering the users clear and well-sorted navigation, we can ease the learning curve on the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13291 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-1024x967.jpg" alt="e-learning platform ergonomic design" width="1024" height="967" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-1024x967.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-300x283.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-768x725.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-1536x1450.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-07-2048x1934.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The users don’t need to scramble around to find the right option to carry out a task on the platform. The navigational queues and consistency make up a big part of our design considerations.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Simple Page Layouts &amp; Navigation</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">For a positive learner experience, we group similar pages and apply a common design layout for them. This way learners don&#8217;t have to process a new layout every time and can navigate the website intuitively.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our e-learning theoretical framework uses a careful positioning of common interactive elements, such as- menus, logos, CTAs, navigational queues, etc. This way we bring a sense of unity, consistency, and simplicity to the entire website.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">III. Branding Consistency</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many websites, whether eLearning or any other tend to suffer from a lack of branding consistency. The absence of branding elements throughout the web pages will not only hurt your business but ruin the consistency throughout the platform. And that’s why our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/">agile software &amp; website development process</a> focuses on subtly imbibing the branding elements throughout all the pages. This way we can improve on the ergonomic quality of your platform while also enforcing the branding of your eLearning platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A consistent design is simple to understand, and a simple design is consistent through and through. Our ergonomic design process for your eLearning website relies heavily on these two pillars. In the end, the aim of our web &amp; software developers remains the same- to create an eLearning website that enables the users to experience the best of the platform.</p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. Conversion Design: Making eLearning Platform Impactful</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Due to the ease and benefits, eLearning is now a dominant trend in the world. And just like every other trendy thing, the partakers of this market are many. To stand out among the rest and garner more users, you must have a cutting-edge conversion-driven design strategy for the eLearning site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a few pointers from our design experts that will increase the conversion rates through the e-learning UX design at a rapid pace.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Optimizing The Content For Speed</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">eLearning sites tend to be full of numerous visual content such as videos, slides, images, etc. And for the website to function properly, we optimize all the visual design content carefully to increase conversion. Here are some specific parts of our entire process that enhances conversion on the platform-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Using High-Quality Visual Content</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Low quality of visual educational elements would cause the users to lose interest and leave the platform as soon as they land on it. And that’s why as an experienced custom software &amp; <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">web development company</a>, we make use of high-quality visual elements to intrigue the users from the very beginning.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Optimizing Content For Site Speed</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">On one hand, you need high-quality images and other visual content. On the other hand, these elements need to be optimized for better speed as well. The users want a seamless experience on the platform, and to facilitate that, we follow site speed optimization best practices, so that the users can learn without any delay.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">III. Text Content Quality &amp; Language</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The text elements on the website, whether it is part of a curriculum or homepage text, must fit into the expectations of the audience. The same kind of text content will not satisfy different kinds of demographics. And that’s why we ensure that the content elements of effective e-learning design are consistent with user expectations.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Familiar Hierarchy Of Content And Elements</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Website content hierarchy is all about providing value to the users. As the owner of an eLearning site, you want the visitors on the site to sign up for courses, register for email notifications, as well as engage more with the platform. And for that, we adhere to the content hierarchy best practices of an e-learning theoretical framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Familiar homepage patterns, like the ‘F’ or ‘Z’ pattern of content hierarchy, makes for the best and most engaging design pattern when it comes to eLearning platforms. Content distributed across the pages in this pattern makes it almost intuitive for the users, enhancing the quality of the e-learning platform ergonomic design.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13292 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-1024x986.jpg" alt="eLearning platform ergonomic design" width="1024" height="986" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-1024x986.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-300x289.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-768x739.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-1536x1478.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-08-2048x1971.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Besides the familiar pattern of content distribution, we make use of proper headlines and bullets to make the hierarchy more prominent. This way the users are well aware of what information they are about to access beforehand. Maintaining this kind of content hierarchy throughout the pages makes it easier for the users to surf the website, and increases chances of conversion with page design.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Optimal CTA Placement</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">CTA buttons often act as a major navigational element on an eLearning website. Whether it is a signup button or a next video button, these elements need to stand out from the rest. And that’s why we take special care when it comes to CTA placement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13293 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-1000x1024.jpg" alt="e-learning platform ergonomic design" width="1000" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-1000x1024.jpg 1000w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-293x300.jpg 293w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-768x787.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-1499x1536.jpg 1499w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ergonomic-and-conversion-focused-eLearning-web-design-article-09-1999x2048.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some of the specific CTA strategies we follow when designing an eLearning platform-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Make The CTA Prominent</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first strategy is to make sure that the CTA design is prominent and easy to spot. This can be ensured in two ways- the first being the design of the CTA and the second being the placement of the button.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the design of CTAs, we follow the brand color guideline, making it stand out among the rest of the content on the page. Along with that, we also place the CTA on an easy-to-spot place using the rule of the thirds so that the user notices the call to action as soon as they land on the page.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Use Strong &amp; Concise CTA Text</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The CTA message/text needs to be strong, concise, and emotional. Due to the lack of space in the e-learning UX design, we must use only a few words to explain to the user what is about to happen once they click on the CTA. Additionally, the CTA text cannot be too commercial. For an eLearning website, the message must excite and encourage the users, not make them wary of another commercial gimmick.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">III. Make The Destination Obvious</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to CTA placement, the main rule is the rule of no surprises. The users want to be taken to the expected pages. Taking them to any other page or another website will not be satisfying. And that’s why we make the CTA text strong yet obvious to understand so that the user knows what will happen when they click on the button.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">D. Integrating Valuable Features &amp; Functionalities</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last but not least we come to the matter of features and functionality. The right feature contributes to the conversion-focused website design a lot more than anyone can anticipate. To go head to head with your competitors, you must have the most essential features that make the experience on the site positive. Here&#8217;s a list of features that our web and <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/custom-software-development/">custom software developers</a> suggest enhancing the conversion of the eLearning platform –</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">I. Basic Profile Creation &amp; Management Feature</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first and most important of all the basic features are the profile creation and management options. With this specific feature element of effective e-learning design, the users can create a personal profile on the platform, add and edit information, and manage easily. To use this feature the users can either make use of email and password, or they can sign up using any social platform.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">II. Gamified Experience</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Small animations, colors, and micro-interactions- all are part of the gamified experience. Such small elements of design make the learning activities even more engaging and compel the users to carry on using the platform. Along with improving the e-learning platform ergonomic design, it also enhances conversion in large numbers.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Expert Speaks: Breaking away from the traditional classroom setting, gamification can provide better engagement and learning experience on the platform. And that’s why we suggest never overlooking this important aspect of eLearning website design.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">III. Data/Progress Analysis</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The data/progress analysis feature helps the learners online to understand how well their learning practices on the platform are going and how much they need to improve. The comprehensive database dashboard design for e-learning systems holds all kinds of analytical information about the user’s activities on the platform – from how many hours they have spent on the platform learning to final evaluation. This single feature will enhance the efficiency of learning on the platform a lot more and ensure conversion.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">IV. Accessibility Option</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accessibility goes a long way to convert consumers to your platform. Even within the target audience, there will be many users with specific needs. Through accessibility features, we create a high-quality e-learning platform ergonomic design, that enhances the user experience on the platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accessibility features such as language support, image alt text, video subtitles, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/dark-mode-in-web-design/">website dark mode</a>, all these features may seem simple, but make a big difference for many users out there. And that’s how through conversion-focused eLearning website design we ensure that every learner’s needs are taken care of on the eLearning platform.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Are You Ready To Follow The eLearning Design Path To Success?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ergonomic design and focusing on conversion- the combination of two worlds can bring your eLearning platform a complete success. However, you need expert help to imbibe both these principles within the platform. So in case you have any questions, <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/about/contact/">send us a message</a> cause our design experts are ready to solve any questions you might have.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s talk about <a href="https://www.quibi.com/" target="_blank">Quibi</a>, the American short movie platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The ambitious streaming platform, launched in 2020 April, was made for people on the go. It offered shows with 5-10 minutes long episodes. It garnered a lot of attention, and even a massive $1.75 billion investment. But its journey was cut short in December 2020 due to a lack of subscribers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-post-mortem/">later post mortem</a> revealed the main reason for Quibi’s failure- the lack of an MVP approach. The platform tried to compete against streaming service giants during the height of pandemic times, with a not-so-unique idea. Had they used an MVP software development approach and assessed the market before launching, the story might’ve ended differently.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MVP development enables you to launch a product with minimal features, enough to fulfill the basic needs of the users. This way, you can gather data on consumers, the market, and validate your business idea before investing more resources. Remember- to avoid disastrous endings like Quibi, an MVP approach is mandatory.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But how do you proceed with MVP software development? Let’s unravel the secrets of this approach one by one in the following points.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. The Distinctions Of The MVP Software Development</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One search online would reveal that there are all sorts of minimal approach terms related to MVP. So before we get started on the discussion of how do you develop an MVP, let’s look at these related terms and consider how they relate to each other.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. MVP [Minimum Viable product]</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first and perhaps the most popular minimal approach is MVP.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Used first in <a href="https://www.oberlo.in/blog/lean-startup">Eric Ries’ book Lean Startup</a>, an MVP product development is a perfect approach for you to validate your business idea. It is not the first version of your digital product, rather a platform with minimal features, coding, and design. This can be a landing page that helps you learn about what kind of consumers are attracted to your business. Additionally, it can also be an app with a basic feature aimed at solving a core problem of the users.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13271 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-853x1024.jpg" alt="MVP software development" width="853" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-853x1024.jpg 853w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-250x300.jpg 250w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-768x922.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-1279x1536.jpg 1279w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-1706x2048.jpg 1706w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The MVP is in no way meant to be a long-lasting solution. It is part of the B.M.L method. One is supposed to build an MVP, measure the feedback gathered from it, learn from that accumulated feedback and then enhance the platform with that learning. It helps the entrepreneurs to understand the unique problems the users are facing, and come up with unique solutions.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. MMP [Minimum Marketable Product]</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">MMP, also known as minimum marketable product or minimum shippable product, happens to be similar to MVP, but a little different at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the approach of minimal resources and effort investment stays the same, the approach towards the longevity of the platform changes. An MVP app development is only supposed to be used for experiment and feedback gathering purposes. On the other hand, MMP is supposed to provide real value to the users, from the very initial stage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Created using some must-have features, an MMP is a digital product that can be marketed and sold to the users out there. Whether it is a <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web app development</a> or a site, with such a platform, users can complete the task they set out to do, and entrepreneurs can gather data and earn revenue at the same time. An MMP is simply the marketable version of the MVP approach.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. MDP [Minimum Desirable Product]</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Minimal desirable products are one step ahead of the MVP approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the MVP services come with many benefits, you can hardly excite and attract users with them. Even with an MMP approach, the best you’d be able to do is to gather more feedback from the users on what more features the product needs. Very few would stick around until the platform becomes better, most will leave without a second glance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the minimum desirable product, you can use exciting UX/UI elements to hook the users from the beginning, no matter how little the platform does. The additional aspect of user-centricity turns the simple MVP into a minimum valuable product. The MDP approach will help you to attract and retain users from the very beginning.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Expert speaks: For a startup, it is crucial to acquire and retain users from the very beginning. Our experts suggest that as a new entrant into the market, going to an MDP approach will be the best possible way. With this, you can offer the clients a valuable experience and features that will solve their problems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. The Relations Between The Minimal Approaches: A Brief Overview</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are thinking that it doesn’t really matter which one of the above approaches you choose, then think again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite being closely related, the three kinds of minimal approach have their own distinction as well. So let’s explore exactly how they are related, and how they differ.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. The Relationship</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s look at the relationship first.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MVP, MDP, and MMP are the steps of the MVP software development process to create a product that is ready for launch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Through careful MVP solutions are created and launched into the market to accumulate user feedback. This feedback not only consists of data on what type of consumers are being attracted to the platform. It also contains information on what kind of features, UI/UX requirements they are looking for, as well as the extra value that might retain them for a long time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Heeding this feedback, the developers can enhance the platform, the MVP user experience, and improve the overall experience to make the product more desirable, therefore more prone to success. From here it is only a few modifications away to turn it into a minimally marketable product that can be officially launched into the market and earn revenue.</p>

</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. The Differences</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are multiple differences between the three MVP software development approaches.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the main purpose of development to the time and cost, all these differences make the MVP solutions vary widely from one another. And these differences are also the reason why most companies tend to choose a singular minimal approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here’s a compact look at all the major differences between MVP, MDP &amp; MMP-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13266" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-776x1024.jpg" alt="MVP software development" width="776" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-776x1024.jpg 776w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-227x300.jpg 227w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-768x1014.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-1164x1536.jpg 1164w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-1551x2048.jpg 1551w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-scaled.jpg 1939w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now that you have a comprehensive idea about the relationship and differences between the three kinds of minimal approach, it’s time to talk about the perfect process of developing an MVP.</p>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. How To Develop The Perfect MVP: Our Process</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many consider MVP to be dead. On the other hand, many think startup MVP development is the only way to launch an idea into the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But which opinion is the right opinion?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, as the tech partners of numerous ideas that achieved staggering progress in their industry, we can vouch that the MVP approach is truly, not dead. But the process of MVP development has changed. Previously, entrepreneurs would take the most minimal approach while developing, resulting in a product that barely fulfilled user needs. The hyper fixation with minimalism in MVP software development has changed now. More and more <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">web development companies</a> these days are focusing on creating a viable product with minimal effort so that the initial business requirements can be fulfilled.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Kicking Off With A Look Into The Market</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A product, digital or not, must fit into the kind of needs and wants the target users to have. Failing to do so will result in catastrophic failure. <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/">According to research</a>, more than 42% of times a startup fails because their product was not needed in the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As an experienced MVP development company, we begin with a complete market analysis. The research includes the core problem the digital product is aiming to solve, the already available solutions in the market, how they serve or fail to serve the target demographic, and what kind of unique valuation the users are looking for.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">More information means better chances of success right off the bat. Knowing the market, the users, and the competitors gives us and our clients a solid foundation, to begin with. This way we can determine what the minimum viable product software development needs to succeed.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Consider The Value Addition</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The prevalence of digital solutions has made it almost impossible to break into the market successfully. There are simply way too many solutions for one problem, all of them more or less the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that’s why the next step of MVP project management &amp; development is the value addition/idea validation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13269 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-803x1024.jpg" alt="MVP software development" width="803" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-803x1024.jpg 803w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-235x300.jpg 235w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-768x979.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-1205x1536.jpg 1205w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-1606x2048.jpg 1606w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-scaled.jpg 2008w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The MVP software development stage is all about giving the target demographic the first taste of your unique idea that solves problems more efficiently than other solutions available. And that’s why despite it being the minimal effort stage the idea needs to be implemented well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this stage, we take a look at the possible competitors, and what they are doing. This way we can pinpoint the exact gaps left by the industry rivals and how the solution can fulfill those gaps. After creating a one-of-a-kind value offering document for the idea, we then move onto the next stage of the MVP development, which is mapping the user flow.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Expert Speaks: To make a unique MVP, you must start with a unique idea. However, that unique idea must solve a major problem. So focus on the problem you are aiming to solve and analyze the market to see what kind of solutions are already available. Doing this will save you a lot of rethinking &amp; reworking at a later stage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Mapping Out The User Flow</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Granted that MVP product development includes only the basic features and functionalities. But that does not mean it is okay to completely ignore the design flow. To understand the unique offering which is your idea, the users need to be able to use the platform (app or web) properly. And this is where the third stage comes in.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our process of building a minimum valuable product includes a user-centric point of view where we first document the major pain points they face while trying to solve a problem using one of the existing solutions. And then we design a user flow on the MVP platform that solves the pain points and empowers them to fulfill their tasks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this stage, we make use of our UX &amp; <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/website-design/">web design expertise</a> and map out an intuitive user flow from the beginning to the end of the journey on the platform. Our design teams implement design best practices and policies that give the platform a polished experience from the first stage.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">D. Set The Feature Priorities Right</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The key stage of MVP development, feature sorting is one of the many things that determine how successful the minimally viable product is going to be. Failing to decide on the essential features during this stage can put the entire future of the product at risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Out of the many methods of prioritizing features, we stand by the user story mapping process. A part of our MVP agile development process, it helps us to list the essential MVP features that help the product accomplish its goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13268 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-558x1024.jpg" alt="MVP software development" width="558" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-558x1024.jpg 558w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-164x300.jpg 164w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-768x1409.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-837x1536.jpg 837w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-1116x2048.jpg 1116w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-scaled.jpg 1395w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here’s how we approach the feature sorting process with our well-defined user story mapping process-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Step 1</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">We begin with the goals the user wants to accomplish with the digital product. Whether it is signing up on the platform, or performing any other task- we start by listing out the possible goals the product will help the users to achieve.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Step 2:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once we have listed the goals, we divide them into activities. The activities are the tasks a user must complete to accomplish their goal- like registering with the right credentials to create an account on the platform.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Step 3:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the activities are assigned under each goal, it is time to break down the activities into smaller user stories. These user stories are various actions users perform on the platform to achieve certain goals. During MVP development, these stories are sorted from the highest priority to the lowest priority accordingly.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">E. Follow Through With BML (build, measure, learn) Model</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">An MVP is in no way the final product. No matter how desirable experience it offers or how much revenue it is earning from the day it was launched, you must continuously improve the product through MVP programming. And that’s why this stage is an integral part of our MVP development lifecycle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13270" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-915x1024.jpg" alt="" width="915" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-915x1024.jpg 915w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-268x300.jpg 268w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-768x859.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-1373x1536.jpg 1373w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-1830x2048.jpg 1830w" sizes="(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As one of the skilled MVP development services in the industry, we measure the impact made by the product once it is launched into the market. This measuring process provides us with insight into how well the product is helping the audience, where it is failing, and what more the audience expects from it. With all this information, we get back to work again and start implementing the acquired knowledge to improve the platform for the better.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The entire process, from the first stage to the last, is conducted by keeping the users &amp; business goals in mind. The success of the MVP process depends on striking a harmony between the two, and our process adheres to that rule at all costs.</p>

<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. MVP Benefits: Why Should You Even Go Through All The Trouble?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why even go to all the trouble?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why not develop the entire platform in one go, launch it into the market, and hope for the best? Well, doing so will seriously hurt the chances of business success. And that’s why it is better to go for an MVP software development approach at the initial stages of the development.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a few more MVP business benefits to convince you about the effectiveness of this approach.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Affordability</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">First comes the benefit of affordability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whether you happen to be a startup entrepreneur or an established business owner, your aim must be to get your tech initiatives off the ground with minimal waste of resources. And for that MVP is the perfect approach. Affordable MVP development cost, in combination with the iterative process, makes for an encouraging environment for the development and success of your tech idea.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Validating The Market Demand</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the major reasons for business failure is having little to no market demand for the product you are trying to sell.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sure your idea may be unique, and it may be able to help the people, but is there a market for it? The MVP programming, which begins with comprehensive industry analysis will save you from all the market failure-related trouble. You can get access to information on what kind of digital solutions already exist, how they help the users, and how your solutions are different. Having and using all this information, you have a better chance to succeed in the industry.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Testing Out The Business Concept</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Launching the idea without testing it is like taking a blind leap off of a mountain cliff. The idea and business revenue model should go through rigorous testing before the launch. And once again MVP app design offers you the time window to test the business concept, tweak it for better results, and then launch it when you feel like it will generate the expected results.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">D. Examining The Impact Of The Product</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The MVP prototype helps to understand the kind of impact the product will have on the target market. After launch, we apply the B.M.L method and measure the impact of the platform on the target users. This information will then help us to improve the product and enhance its future impact on the industry and users.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">E. Building An Early Relationship With The Customers</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Modern businesses and solutions must be customer-centric to succeed. With MVP product management, one can build an early connection with the target consumers. With their feedback, the consumers will inadvertently become part of the development process. This will make them feel more invested in the overall success of the solution. This way you can effortlessly make the entire process consumer-centric.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">It Is Easy To Achieve Skyrocketing Success With A Modern Day MVP Approach!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">MVP is not dead. It has merely changed its traditional form to match the modern-day requirements of both businesses and consumers.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">What is digital transformation?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Search online and you’ll be bombarded with thousands of digital transformation definitions. Some will talk about how it is the integrations of the latest tech solutions within the business process. Some, on the other hand, talk about how it is almost a spiritual business change. In the end, you’ll close that tab with one question in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“What is digital transformation for MY business?”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s look at the definition.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. What Is Digital Transformation: Popularity, Definition &amp; The Benefits</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Digital transformation, also known as DX or digitalization happens to be the most popular search query right now. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/870924/worldwide-digital-transformation-market-size/">Statista</a>, the direct digital transformation technology investment amount is going to reach a total of $6.8 trillion between 2020-2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All entrepreneurs are gearing up to turn their businesses into the next digital sensation. But before joining that crowd, you have to understand what it means.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Duality Of Definition</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is no single definition for digital transformation, despite its popularity. And it is mainly because everyone has a different definition of the term &#8216;digital&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some will tell you that it is all about the integration of technical solutions. For others, it is the automation of the business process. And some groups believe it is a 360-degree change that impacts the business from the inside out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But which one of them is true?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13150" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-1024x986.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="986" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-1024x986.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-300x289.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-768x740.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-1536x1479.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-01-1-2048x1972.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, all of them are. Digital business transformation strategy is not a single faceted matter. In fact, it is a dynamic journey that includes both kinds of definitions. So let&#8217;s look at the different meanings of this process.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">a. The Narrow Perspective</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The narrow perspective of digital transformation is focused on only innovative technology solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The narrow definitions talk only about technology. Be it AI, AR/VR, blockchain, or IoT, it is always about how these solutions will help your business. However, it is not always inclusive of specific business needs.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">b. The Broader Perspective</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The broader perspective of digital transformation definition focuses on the process and people involved. It is a complete transformation of the older business structure. This transformation impacts the employees and alters the way they can provide valuable experience to the consumers.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">c. What Is Digital Transformation: The Combined Perspective</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">You cannot define digital transformation focusing on only one of the perspectives. They are both parts of a complete transformation effort. And that’s why the combined definition looks something like this-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><i>“Digital transformation is the integration of necessary technical solutions within the business process. It alters the existing work model &amp; organization culture, streamlining the communication &amp; collaboration efforts of the employees. Overall, it helps to reach business goals and deliver better value to the consumer at the same time.”</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><i>The combined definition covers all the necessary parts of </i><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/digital-transformation-strategy/"><i>digital business transformation strategy</i></a> <i>one can find online-</i></p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">It includes the matter of business/enterprise technology solutions. <i>(Not FOMO based technical integrations)</i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Includes the matter of the existing work model &amp; cultural change. <i>(To be digital, the employees must think digital)</i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">And lastly, it includes the employees and consumers as well.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that is the perfect definition of DX. Now let’s talk about how our experts at <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">Unified Infotech</a> make a digital transformation process work.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. The Process Of Transformation</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the definition above, we know that there are three aspects of the digital transformation maturity model. These are-</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The technology</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The business culture</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The people</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">The process of transformation will also depend on these three aspects. So what does the process look like?-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13146" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-768x767.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-1536x1534.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-02-1-2048x2045.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 1: Beginning With A Purpose</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beginning with a clear purpose is the first step of complete transformation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/8/digital-transformation-how-lead">Jay Ferro of Quikrete explained</a>, “Digital transformation should begin with a problem statement, a clear opportunity, or an aspirational goal”. This way you can create a necessity within the employees. This sense of urgency drives up the speed of the transformation process.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beginning with a purpose will help you to clearly explain to the employees what the aim is. Knowing the endgame, the people involved in the process will be more excited about the whole journey. And this enthusiasm will make them more willing to fit into the new digital style.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Starting the process only with business technology solutions in mind will be a waste of resources. So ensure that the process starts with a clear purpose, a definitive “WHY?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 2: Determining The Scale</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not every organization is on the same level when it comes to its digital operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe the competitor is light years ahead of you when it comes to the modern business landscape. On the other hand, maybe they are just beginning with their attempts at transforming the business. Either way, the second step will be to determine its transformational stage you&#8217;re on.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On this second step, many professional services leverage the <a href="https://ceo801mstro0h2uinte.blob.core.windows.net/legacyassets/system/manifestos/pdfs/000/000/996/original/178.03.DigitalTransformation.pdf">5 stage model of digital transformation by Tony Saldanha</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13147" style="width: 864px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13147 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png" alt="" width="864" height="479" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png 864w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-300x166.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-768x426.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13147" class="wp-caption-text">Source: inthebooks.800ceoread.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">The model displays 5 stages of the digital work-process in a company. When you determine which stage your organization belongs to from the beginning, it will result in better planning. For example, an organization that belongs to the foundational stage will need more than a plan. It will need a robust training curriculum and in-depth insight into consumer&#8217;s favorite digital trends.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Based on the stage, you will have to craft effective plans for business operations management. So, in this second step, analyze your business process and define the scale of effort that is required.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 3: Choosing The Right Tech Enablers</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the step that focuses on the technical aspect of the process. Choosing the right tech enablers depends on two things. The first being your purpose. And the second being the stage of transformation your company belongs to.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When thinking about what is digital transformation, many only think of the tech-approach. The tech-first approach is the reason for failure for many organizations. And that’s why whatever enterprise technology solutions you focus on during this stage should depend on these elements-</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The main purpose of the entire transformation effort.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The stage of transformation you are aiming for.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The technical trends that are popular within your industry and among the competitors.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">These touchpoints will ensure that the innovative technology solutions provide real value to your business process.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 4: Focusing On The Cultural Change</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just having some business technology solutions is not going to be enough. You need to update the company culture to match the latest work process.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Streamlining the business process requires a level of cultural change within the company. This change includes an understanding of employee values, opinions, and expertise on the integrated solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A lack of alignment can cause the entire process to fail in the technical integration stage. Employees who don&#8217;t understand the reason for this change will be reluctant to make any efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Carey Oven, a partner with Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory at Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP <a href="https://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2019/07/18/the-role-of-culture-in-digital-transformation/">puts it</a> perfectly. According to her- the leaders must win the hearts of employees with tech initiatives. Otherwise, the effort will stall before it has any positive impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The people involved must be onboard with the digital transformation technology investments. Or, your efforts will fail before they can take a concrete shape.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 5: Optimizing The Complete Consumer Experience</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Transformation efforts should also aim for a better customer experience. There’s no point in increasing functional efficiency if it fails to elevate the quality of the CX.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The positive impact of digital transformation on customer experience helps to scale the business. For this, you must break down the institutional data silos first. With the use of combined insight, you&#8217;ll get a better idea of what people are experiencing. Based on the consumer input, you will have a better chance of enhancing the CX through proper digital solutions.<i> </i></p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Blockchain Impact On Solar</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">At this point, we are all familiar with the concept of distributed/decentralized database, a.k.a blockchain. Popular for its bitcoin application, blockchain is now changing the solar industry as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Until now, there have been two breakthroughs in the use of blockchain in the solar industry. The first one being easy P2P trading of energy. And the second one being the reduction of fraud in the corporate trading of solar energy. Let’s look at these in details-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">i. Peer To Peer Trading Of Energy</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the significant breakthroughs is blockchain&#8217;s use for P2P power trading. And the blockchain experiment, funded by the Australian government proved this. With this process, homeowners were able to sell the leftover energy produced from the domestic solar fixtures in a localized manner. They were able to set their price and trade at will.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13133 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-824x1024.jpg" alt="digital transformation of the energy sector solar" width="824" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-824x1024.jpg 824w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-242x300.jpg 242w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-768x954.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-1237x1536.jpg 1237w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-03-1649x2048.jpg 1649w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite the negative sides, such as irregular prices set by individuals, this method has proven to be worthy. With this digital transformation method, individuals can now settle their funds faster. Earlier they would have to wait a certain period of time for their electricity bill and feed in traffics to settle. Now with blockchain, that process can be done almost instantly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, the ability to release tokenized funds upon meeting specific terms is another great benefit of this technology. The use of blockchain will help you to remove transactional friction easily for the solar organization. So don&#8217;t forget to pay attention to blockchain benefits when planning a transformation for your organization.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">ii. Efficient Validation &amp; Certification</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Corporate accountability is pushing companies to be more eco-friendly. As a result, more business leaders are trying to implement solar solutions in the business process. However, the use of clean electricity does not always mean eco-friendly. And that&#8217;s why solar companies are using blockchain certification for every unit of energy they sell.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the use of blockchain, solar power suppliers and corporates are building a transparent business relationship. Solar companies are using blockchain to provide a smart contract with every unit of power a big corporate buys. This way buyers can validate the certificate of origin. This use of blockchain in the solar digital transformation will help you fulfill the business objectives of going green.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. IoT Taking Solar To The Next Level</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unlike the traditional energy sector, the solar industry needs to use remote methods to generate energy. Most of their main pieces of equipment are usually on the field, facing the best and worst of nature. However, the IoT applications in the solar energy sector make equipment maintenance a lot easier.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The positive impact of IoT on the energy sector also includes reducing the complexity related to power grids. The cloud-based data gathering process helps to monitor various on-field gears in real-time. You can access the data from a centralized control panel easily, and take necessary actions. The IoT collected data can also be used for advanced analysis and preservation.</p>

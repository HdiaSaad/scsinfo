										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, how long will it take to develop your software solution?</p>
<p>It is a question you must have asked your development partner at least once. And it is indeed, important for you to know how much time and money it will take to develop your custom solution.</p>
<p>Proper cost estimation in project management is the very soul of the development process. Everyone is aware of the importance of providing clear assessments to the clients. Both clients and development teams would agree that the benefits of this practice are many.</p>
<p>So if you are still wondering how long it will take to develop your software solution, read on. In the following paragraphs, we are about to discuss some crucial elements of project estimation, and our in-house process of project estimation, curated by the very best of our team.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: justify;">1. Agile Vs Traditional: A War Of Estimates</h2>
<p>Once, software developers did things more traditionally. The process started with the project manager mapping out the project plan, complete with all the tasks, dependencies, and assigned teammates. However, with the rise of the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile development manifesto</a> the software project estimation approach changed entirely.</p>
<p>Early project planning methods pinned down the scope of the project and let the development time and cost vary. Needless to say, this resulted in a flawed time and cost estimation for the project. And that&#8217;s why the estimating techniques for agile projects take the opposite approach. It pins down the time and cost of development within a set range and lets the scope of the project vary.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13309 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-888x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="888" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-888x1024.jpg 888w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-260x300.jpg 260w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-768x885.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-1332x1536.jpg 1332w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-01-1777x2048.jpg 1777w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></p>
<p>Rather than starting with a “Complete” idea of the project, the agile process begins with high-level scoping. This way we can learn more about the project, clarify our doubts, understand the core features, functionalities needed. This understanding further helps us to streamline the development process &amp; assign the right tech stack and experts.</p>
<p>Leaving the rigid and unchanging traditional estimation process behind, the modern method creates more room for success. <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/">Our agile methods</a> for estimating project times and costs ensure that the assessment is done based on a concrete understanding of the project, and not simple assumptions. Additionally, this also provides the scope of the project to change and adapt to the changing business needs, promoting future growth for our clients.</p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Project Estimation For Software Development: A Game Of Benefits!</h2>
<p>Starting the development process with a clear idea of how much to invest is not just beneficial to the clients, but to us as well. It is a solid base of knowledge helping us to assess the kind of effort and expertise the product development process needs to be successful.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13310 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-888x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation benefits" width="888" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-888x1024.jpg 888w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-260x300.jpg 260w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-768x885.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-1332x1536.jpg 1332w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-02-1777x2048.jpg 1777w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></p>
<p>Let’s go through the below list of benefits to comprehend how the proper process of cost estimation in project management benefits both the clients and the developers-</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>A. It Increases Trust</h3>
<p>Trust is important for any kind of relationship, especially if it is a business relationship.</p>
<p>Imagine dealing with a development partner that does not provide you with a clear budget and cost estimation of a project. They don’t tell you how long it might take to build the solution and leave you completely in the dark.</p>
<p>Sounds horrible, doesn’t it? Imagine not knowing a single thing about the very important development project that will change the face of business. Such an experience does not increase any kind of trust in the development agency. On the other hand, a clear idea on project estimation is sure to increase trust between clients and developers. And that’s why <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">experienced web development agencies</a> always ensure that a proper assessment process is integral to the development project.</p>
<h3>B. Improves The Value Of The Project</h3>
<p>ROI or return on investment determines the value of any software. How much return are you going to get from your investment in the development? And an inaccurate answer to this question will seriously diminish the value of the project.</p>
<p>Additionally, a successful development project also results in improved experience and a better reputation in the industry. This is why a reliable project estimation is beneficial for both the clients and the development agencies. For one side, it provides real value, and ROI. And for the other side, it offers meaningful experience, expertise, and an improved relationship with the clients.</p>
<h3>C. Define And Meet Realistic Deadlines</h3>
<p>Imagine launching a marketing campaign for your latest customer-facing software, only to realize that development will take more time. Not only do you have to change a lot of decisions you made, but it will also impact your reputation in the market.</p>
<p>A bona fide agile project estimation process enables development teams to understand the scope of the project and then set a realistic deadline. Starting with the initial analysis of the proposal, we begin scoping out the features, functionalities, user stories &amp; tech stack before finally predicting a range of timelines. This kind of deadline is realistic and much easier to meet.</p>
<h3>D. Encourages Faster Result</h3>
<p>It is an established truth that reliable IT project cost estimation techniques make development faster. Following the agile methodology, the project requirements are broken down and prioritized for the sprint plan creation.</p>
<p>It is more feasible for the developers to build a meaningful product with a comprehensive sprint plan. They can focus on the essential elements of development first, and ensure that those elements work perfectly for the clients. This way we can deliver a successful product a lot faster,</p>
<h3>E. Help Clients Make Better Business Decisions</h3>
<p>Imagine going grocery shopping with a fixed budget for every product on your list. And then when you get there, you realize that the price of one essential product on the list has increased. To accommodate that, you now have to eliminate one of the other grocery items on the list. This can be easily done since we are only talking about groceries. But such decisions are not easy to make when it comes to your business.</p>
<p>You can’t get rid of a business process as easy as scratching off ketchup from the grocery list. Just because you have to get a <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/custom-software-development/">custom software solution</a>, or a website developed doesn’t mean you can let other aspects of the business suffer. And that’s why you require the proper project cost estimation and budgeting. This way you’ll know exactly how to allocate resources throughout the business, and make smart choices that do not hinder the business growth.</p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: justify;">3. A Straightforward Project Estimation: Unified’s Own Process</h2>
<p>Knowing the time and cost range for the project’s development will streamline strategic business decision-making processes for you. Whether you are a start-up entrepreneur or an established businessman entering the tech world- knowing how much to invest and what to expect as ROI is the key to success. So how to estimate project cost and time? Here’s Unified Infotech&#8217;s very own process explained in brief for you.</p>
<h3>A. Beginning With A Basic Estimation</h3>
<p>Any cost and time estimation in project management provided without a clear idea of the project is irrelevant. However, the clients need a basic model before they begin a partnership with us. And that’s why our estimation process begins with a fundamental assessment of the initial proposal.</p>
<p>Based on the client&#8217;s initial requirement, our sales team consults with the development expert and provides clients with a base level time &amp; cost estimation. This estimation is never too far from how much it will actually take to develop the solution. However, it is still an initial estimation based only on the basic idea of the project. There will be some changes to this estimate during the later stages.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Exclusive insight: This estimate is never the same for two projects. Based on various factors, such as specific requirements, project type, design expectations, core functionalities, and many others, the basic estimation varies widely. This is done to ensure that every product we develop is completely relevant to the clients, and is successful in fulfilling its goals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>B. Discovery &amp; Planning: Solidifying The Estimation Base</h3>
<p>With the client on board and the kick-off phase completed, we begin our discovery and planning phase. This phase is also when we validate all the project cost, time &amp; effort estimation done so far.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13311 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-894x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="894" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-894x1024.jpg 894w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-262x300.jpg 262w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-768x879.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-1342x1536.jpg 1342w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-03-1789x2048.jpg 1789w" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px" /></p>
<p>The basic estimate provided by the sales team is already assessed once during the high-level scope of the pre-kick-off process. It is based on the deliverables determined through the collaboration between the client and the team. Next up comes a more detailed estimation stage where we put the details of the deliverables on the discussion board. From there, our project managers measure the effort and hours necessary for development.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of how the estimation process goes down during the discovery and planning process.</p>
<h4>I. Understanding The Basic Objective</h4>
<p>The purpose of this step is to understand the project well enough before moving in with the detailed analysis of the process. Additionally, it also enables us to complete the thorough E1 estimation that is a more precise version of the initial software project estimation plan.</p>
<p>During this, we aim to understand all the deliverables, validate the information we have till now, and clarify any additional doubts and questions. Once the high-level deliverables are clarified, we move on to the next step that is epic mapping.</p>
<h4>II. User Story &amp; Epic Mapping</h4>
<p>Epic mapping and user stories are essential parts of our E1 estimation methodology. The epic is a larger component that we can break into smaller user stories. User Stories on the other hand are informal explanations of different features written from the point of view of the users.</p>
<p>As higher-level functionalities, epics contain multiple smaller user stories. For example- in the image below, the user goals each represent an epic. To achieve these goals, the users would need to perform the activities listed as user activities. However, each person would perform the same activity differently, as demonstrated in the image.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13312 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-554x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation user story" width="554" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-554x1024.jpg 554w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-162x300.jpg 162w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-768x1419.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-831x1536.jpg 831w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-1108x2048.jpg 1108w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-04-scaled.jpg 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /></p>
<p>The epic mapping essentially breaks down the deliverables into smaller units enabling the team to understand what components are needed to build the solution. Once it has been finalized by both the internal team members and the client, the project manager begins the E1 estimation of the effort/size of the process. This estimation is done based on the tech stack. The hours and story points decided in this phase are as per the company baseline, and the industry standards. The range of hours in the E1 estimate also includes buffer time that is important for the successful completion of the project in time.</p>
<p>Once the E1 phase is done, the project manager reviews the effort &amp; cost estimation, and then sends it to the rest of the management team. Any differences between the initial estimate and the E1 estimates are documented and analyzed.<i></i></p>

<p class="title">Exclusive insight: While creating a more detailed user story mapping, one of the major goals of the Business Analyst follows is to not let the details increase the estimate. However, in case the estimates increase due to the details, the Project manager must take care of the estimates accordingly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>C. Imbibing Accuracy With E2 Estimation</h3>
<p>To be exact in estimating project management, we take a look back at the estimate once again during the pre-development &amp; planning stage.</p>
<p>The E2 estimation reflects any changes made in the time and effort predicted within the previous estimates. During the pre-development process, our team aims to complete some basic tasks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13313 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-894x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="894" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-894x1024.jpg 894w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-262x300.jpg 262w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-768x879.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-1342x1536.jpg 1342w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-05-1789x2048.jpg 1789w" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px" /></p>
<p>The defined and finalized story point and team efficiency help determine the accurate range of development hours. This finalized software development project cost estimation is then verified by the assigned developers and TLs. Once it is approved by the internal team, the project release plan is sent to the clients.</p>
<p>The project release plan includes crucial information on the release of each spring and the amount of payment for them. We follow this estimation throughout the development with minimal to no deviation whatsoever.</p>

<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: justify;">4. Lastly, Some Best Practices To Keep In Mind</h2>
<p>It is not always possible to be super organized during the development and project estimation process. Project scopes evolve, business requirement changes, markets turn 180 degrees on their head, and client preferences change as well. Amid all this chaos, the development agency you partner up with must follow a well-established set of project management estimation best practices. What are they, you wonder? Well, here’s a list-</p>
<h3>A. Honesty/Clarity About The Figures</h3>
<p>Honesty and clarity are the most important thing when it comes to project estimation. How else can we gain the trust of the clients?</p>
<p>Our estimates are based on concrete knowledge of the project, as well as the complete idea of all the requirements, such as tech stack, third-party components, and internal resources necessary. By providing an honest estimation to the clients, we enable them for future growth and build a longer-lasting relationship with them.</p>
<h3>B. Setting Clear Assumptions</h3>
<p>While it might be possible for the development teams in the movies to build an impossible amount of deliverables within a short amount of time, it is not the case for real-world developers. In real-life scenarios, client preferences change, markets change, and a lot of other things might delay or hamper the development process.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13314 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-934x1024.jpg" alt="project estimation" width="934" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-934x1024.jpg 934w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-274x300.jpg 274w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-768x842.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-1401x1536.jpg 1401w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/project-estimation-website-article-06-1869x2048.jpg 1869w" sizes="(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" /></p>
<p>And that’s why the second cost estimation best practice we follow is setting clear assumptions. We neither overestimate nor underestimate a project scope. Considering a proposal from a real-world perspective, we set a clear picture of how the development process will be like to the clients. This provides them with a clear idea of the investment amount, as well as the future ROI.</p>

<h3>C. Consider All The Risks</h3>
<p>Beginning a project without considering all the risks first is an act of hubris. Our software project estimation process includes detailed risk consideration and management planning. This plan ensures that in case of any challenges arising, we can mitigate it before it impacts the project or our clients negatively.</p>
<h2>Despite The Estimation Challenges, We Always Aim To Rise To The Occasion!</h2>
<p>Due to the multiple variables, it is not easy to pin down a project estimation that is 100% accurate. However, with a clear idea of the project, as well as utilizing our decade of experience, we can assess the projects well and provide meaningful insight into how many the clients would need to invest.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, do you know how much YOU need to invest in your project? Why not give us a </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/about/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shout-out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? We can provide you with an insight into how much it should really cost to build your website!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has brought everyone to their knees. Since the day it was declared to be a global catastrophe, till right now, it has not only put a stop to normal business processes but has turned the standard industry work processes upside down on its head.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, after more than 6 months, we have settled into this new normal of working from home. But there are still a few questions our clients might have about our work/business process. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it is about our communication process, or productivity and quality of delivery, all these queries and their answers are going to be of paramount importance for you to make the final call about your project.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an establishment that believes in complete transparency, we have heard your questions, and bring the answers to you. So no matter what the questions are, you can find all those answers right here!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/portfolio/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12851 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15.jpg" alt="our portfolio" width="1650" height="1200" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15.jpg 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-1536x1117.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></a></p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Transitions: WFO To WFH, How Your Project Is Going To Be Affected?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/">100% transition of work model that appeared within our organization</a> in less than two days had zero impact on our ongoing projects. Keeping in mind the security of our clients, we ensured that they don’t have to travel to the office for any work purposes. Through the necessary migration of infrastructure, we enabled them to keep up the good work right from the safety of their home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pre-existing remote operation model has helped us even more to embrace this new situation. Instead of wondering about what to do in the face of this unique challenge, we have taken advantage of all aspects and ensured that none of our existing and future clients are affected by this crisis.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Disruption In Communication: We Are Always Here!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business person about to hire a web development partner has only one question- how will the partner be able to keep the communication smooth?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely, social distancing and quarantining measurements have made it hard to keep in touch with people. However, having already anticipated these issues, we implemented the right solutions from the very beginning. And after 6 months, we can proudly say that the timely action has paid off </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that further reiterates our earned feather-in-the-cap of being one of the </span><b>Top Casablanca App Development Agencies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using various collaboration tools, such as Skype, Jira, Asana, Slack, Zoom, Trello, Invision we have created a strong communication network within our teams. The interconnected teams with the above-mentioned tools have operated efficiently from the very beginning and will continue to do so till time immemorial (in case things don’t change!).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now the matter of interconnected teams brings us to the next question-</span></p>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Well The Interlinked Processes Are Working In These Times?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaboration is key, and when it comes to more complex projects, such as a tiered web and app development/design process, collaboration happens to be the ultimate element that keeps the work process going.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our client’s (and of course, yours) multifaceted projects, we have integrated agile collaboration methods that help us to not just stay connected, but solve problems even when we are miles away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tried and tested method has been a part of our work process from the very beginning. And now, our Agile teams are able to apply this system to collaborate better on your projects. Using this, we have eliminated departmental silos, enabling our multidisciplinary teams to collaborate across the establishment and deliver quality products.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is The Crisis In Any Way Going To Affect The Quality Of Service? What About Productivity?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the industry-wide sacrifices and compromises, we are still on track to deliver the very best. The crisis is not something we have not faced in the past, but we’ve always had a contingency plan in place for any kind of risk management.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12972 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-1024x492.jpg" alt="corona work from home" width="1024" height="492" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-1024x492.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-768x369.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-1536x737.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/corona-work-from-home-2048x983.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interdisciplinary team members spread out across their homes are in constant touch (figure of speech) with each other through the collaboration tools we have already mentioned, along with the more conventional tools of communication such as emails, phone calls, and video calls.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, we implemented the use of time tracking tools to ensure that our team members can achieve stability between work and life and are always fit (both psychologically and physically) to deliver the highest quality of work.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Happens When Your Point Of Contact Falls Victim To The Virus?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of our Unified team members, from the very beginning of this pandemic, have taken every precaution to prevent falling ill. Our remote operation model ensures that team members don’t have to travel for any work purpose. However, there’s no denying the fact that the virus can not be controlled.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if unfortunately, your point of contact with us does fall ill, we have backup plans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to ensure that our commitment towards the project as repute as one of the </span><b>Top Casablanca User Experience Agencies </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">remains unperturbed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While the sick individual recovers, we can continue with your projects, without any disruption. All our project administrators, developers, and designers are available to help with your site or app at any time.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_6" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Kind Of Help Will You Get From Our Management?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each member of our workforce is ready to support you during this disastrous time. From our management members, you can get precious consultations on how your business can function and succeed in this new normal. Whether you are an enterprise looking to reinvent, or a startup wondering how to make it in the industry, we have all the right advice that is optimized for this new pandemic market.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_7" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is SCS INFO Following The Downsizing Methods Like Everyone Else?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not really! In fact, if anything, our family has only grown in the past couple of months. Judging and understanding the requirements of the current landscape, we were able to develop apps and websites for our clients that leveraged the current needs of the audience out there. This pivoting technique has helped us to garner even more clients and to facilitate their projects, we hired innovative experts from many different disciplines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downsizing during a crisis is not our style. Rather we like to engage the expertise of our teams to improve upon the work even more. And that result is quite clear from our revenue numbers. Additionally, we are also using this work from home time to up-skill our employees.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_8" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Kind Of Training Campaign Do We Have Going On?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our organization-wide training sessions have been designed to include a vast array of technical and development skill training modules. From web development, design, android/iOS design patterns to generic soft skill, we are aiming to help the team members to become even more proficient in their skills. This will help us deliver better results to you!</span></p>
<h2 id="id_8" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Next?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic is not gone, and the slow unlocking process is not picking up speed anytime soon. And in this new normal, we have all strategies in place to keep delivering quality service to you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we can not predict the future, we can tell you about our plans. The work from the home landscape has made us confident in our skill to work remotely without any compromise in quality. Now we can focus on building a global team of designers and developers who can leverage the remote working system. A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd focus</span> in creating quality websites and apps for our clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning of the Global pandemic of COVID-19, a.k.a Coronavirus, the main problem we have all faced is the lack of a unified source of information and communication. The online world scattered with both reliable and unreliable sources of information have only made the situation worse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding this problem, SCS INFO teamed up with one of their most prominent Australian clients to create an app that will act as the main source of information for Australian users. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Started With An Idea</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the very beginning of this situation, the lack of reliable information turned out to be one of the main problems. As the people all around the world started to struggle against the pandemic without any combined source of information and communication, we teamed up with our Australian clients to design and develop an app that can save people during this situation.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12407 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min-1024x915.png" alt="covid-19" width="1024" height="915" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min-1024x915.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min-300x268.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min-768x686.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min-1536x1372.png 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-features-min.png 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea is simple- providing a straightforward gateway for communication and information to the users. It is not only about having the most important facts but what they are going to do about it and how they are going to take the right steps. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Features Maketh The App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designed specifically to give the users an edge in this fight, the app for COVID-19 is armed with all the right features and functionalities. From travel safety to a faster way of connecting with the authorities, every necessary feature is added to the app to help the users. Want a detailed outlook? Let’s see what the features are then-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Alerts</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important thing right now is to stay up to date with all the COVID-19 news from reliable sources. And that’s why we have integrated the Alerts feature on our app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this feature, users will be instantly alerted about any kind of new development about the pandemic situation. Whether it is about the fluctuation in the number of affected people around the country or any news related to vaccinations, they will get an instant notification.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Map</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The map features heighten the level of interactivity in the app. The users are not only able to check out the global impact of this pandemic, but they can also pinpoint their own country and city to see how it affects their homeland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature is also one of the best shortcuts for the users to get information about the nearest hospital and medical facility. This way they can quickly get to the hospital if needed. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. 13 Health</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature is a straightforward way for the users to contact the healthcare service in case they start showing any symptoms. The user would be able to reach out to the medical services right from the app without any problems. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Location and Travel Information</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Location feature will enable the user to get more information on their locality. Whether it’s about the number of people that have been affected or the hospitals nearest to them and how to get there. With the location feature, they have all the information on their fingertips. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12405 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/location-updates-and-travel-information-1024x915.png" alt="covid app designed by unified infotech" width="1024" height="915" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/location-updates-and-travel-information-1024x915.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/location-updates-and-travel-information-300x268.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/location-updates-and-travel-information-768x686.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/location-updates-and-travel-information-1536x1372.png 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/location-updates-and-travel-information.png 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the travel feature, the users can get the necessary information regarding traveling within and outside the country. From what kind of precautions they need to take during the necessary traveling to the risk factor of traveling to a country, the users would be able to get all the information right here. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Contact Groups</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can make up contact groups for contacting in an emergency. The availability of emergency contacts as a group increases the quality of communication as people are stuck at home during isolation. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Settings</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Settings feature is a simple and straightforward feature for the users to control various aspects of the app. Whether it is about controlling the notifications or managing emergency contacts, the setting is one of the most important features in the app.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12408 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Settings-1024x915.png" alt="location update feature in covid app" width="1024" height="915" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Settings-1024x915.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Settings-300x268.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Settings-768x686.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Settings-1536x1372.png 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Settings.png 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Information</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information feature acts as a hub for information, providing the users with necessary information on the disease, symptoms, prevention, etc. All the information is taken from reliable sources and included for the users to save the users from panic and disorder. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. My COVID Risks</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “My COVID Risks” feature is a unique feature that enables the users to understand whether they are going to contract the disease or not. With this feature, the users simply have to answer a few questions and the app will provide the users with results based on their answer. The feature is designed to provide the users with proper guidance and reduce panic among them. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Review My Results</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature will help the users to check out their results and keep a track of results based on previous queries. This way they can rest assured and know when they have to contact the medical services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global pandemic of COVID-19 is one of the biggest pandemic faced by the world until now. With no vaccination available just yet, the only three steps we can take is to responsibly follow protocols, stay informed about what to do, and self isolates until it’s safe to go out. And with our app, the users might find it a lot easier to do the first two steps. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run, Forrest, Run!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I’m not going to talk about Forrest Gump here! But I’m just taking the reference of “running”. And I’m going to share with you all how we, the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/">UIPL family</a> participated in a recently organized marathon and enjoyed the event throughout the day. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Quick Sneak Peek to “Green Marathon”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBI, our nation-wide renowned Public Sector Bank organized a “Green Marathon” across 15 different cities in India. And it had its Kolkata edition on 23rd February 2020. Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM, another renowned brand of the nation took the initiative of this one of the biggest marathon events in the “City of Joy”. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12163 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sbi-green-marathon.png" alt="sbi green marathon" width="601" height="537" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sbi-green-marathon.png 601w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sbi-green-marathon-300x268.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p><b>Venue Details of the Event: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eco Park Gate 1, AA II, Deshbandhu Nagar, Newtown, Kolkata</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have followed our blog archive, you are probably already aware that at UIPL, we do not always work only. We believe in the “work smart, party hard” motto. So, we arrange games, employee outings, competitions with fun-filled activities, and take part in different events around the city whenever possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, when we got to know about this big marathon event, our management instantly decided to be a part of it. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Greater Cause Behind The Event</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The greener future” &#8211; we all dream about it, right? A cleaner environment, a greener city, breathing fresh year &#8211; all these seem like a fiction in today’s busy world. Pollution and global warming are always in the limelight. These issues are always in the headlines!</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12164 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-1024x682.jpg" alt="forest trees perspective bright" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/forest-trees-perspective-bright-957024.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, in such chaos and amidst so much of negativity, when an event is organized to promote a “greener future”, how can we not be a part of it? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12165 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Green Tree" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pexels-photo-1125776.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the main objective of organizing the “Green Marathon” is showing our commitment towards the greener and fresher environment and sustainable development. And this was indeed a “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">zero-waste</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” event. And being the responsible citizens, we took part in it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if I were to flaunt how physical activities like running can help us, I would have come up with a long list of benefits. Not only better physical health but our finer mental health, enriched soul, personal development &#8211; everything comes from physical activities like running. And not to forget, there is fun too. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Event Day</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, in Kolkata, shivering cold is not an issue in February and that too around the third week of the month. But this year, it was a bit of an exception. And the “Global Warming” caused by us only was one of the main reasons behind it. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12166 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-1024x767.jpeg" alt="UIPL team" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614229730.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, beating the “not-so-freezing” cold, we all reached the venue within the reporting time i.e. 5:45 AM. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different Running Categories</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the entire marathon event had different categories based on the total distance to be covered. The three different categories were:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12167 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-1024x767.jpeg" alt="uipl team 1" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614231701.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21 km</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 km</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 km</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for different categories the reporting time and the flag off time were different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our UIPL family participated in the 5 km marathon. So, our reporting time and flag off time were 5:45 AM and 6:45 AM respectively. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Glimpse of the Ambiance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be amazed to know that around 7,500 participants came that day to participate along with us. Even if it was Sunday, people from different backgrounds and different ages came together to pledge for a greener future.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12168 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-1024x649.jpg" alt="uipl team 2" width="1024" height="649" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-1024x649.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345-768x487.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12345.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gold medalist of the Asian Games, an IPS officer, the first Bengali mountaineer too came to participate. So, from the very beginning, we all felt so energized to see so many enthusiastic and energetic faces around us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the event organizing partners just nailed it. The arrangements were huge. Every participant got t-shirts. And you know what all the t-shirts were organic. The main objective was to promote a greener and cleaner city. And the bibs we all got there consisted of seeds for tree plantation. Sounds cool right? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12169 " src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/green-marathon.png" alt="green marathon" width="853" height="580" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/green-marathon.png 691w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/green-marathon-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Source: https://ibgnews.com</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, on every checkpoint, there were water stations. It is not like everyone can start and finish maintaining the same pace. So, keeping that in mind, there were enough water stations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we got mouth-watering food packets as well after the marathon was over.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Our UIPL Team Performed There </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, even though we clicked a lot of photos together and enjoyed ourselves before starting the marathon and post-marathon while running, not every one of us was together! </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12170 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-1024x767.jpeg" alt="green marathon 1" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614227466.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our developers put on his headphones to listen to some kickass music while running. Another developer was fully concentrating on the run! I’m sure rest performed well too because all of them got their medals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be amazed to know that each of our superwomen at the office, who participated that day, completed the entire 5 km run within the allotted time too. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12172 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-1024x767.jpeg" alt="uipl team 3" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614230932.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, yes, after that kind of achievement, we all want to flaunt our medals! </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Feeling of Achievement</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it is not like every one of us regularly exercise (which is not a very good thing though!). To some extent, our busy lifestyle is kind of responsible for that. Still, when we got an opportunity like this, we could not afford to miss it.</p>
<p></span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12173 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-1024x767.jpeg" alt="uipl team 4" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584614226797.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
See, how the happy faces look! Being able to be a part of a greater and better cause, we all are very happy indeed. And the feeling of an accomplished achievement is clearly visible in our faces! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, we all will plant the seed we got. And if you have reached this far while reading, I would like to request you too that please plant more trees. Also, encourage people to do so and make your city greener, cleaner, and a better place to live. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping Up</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, this was our story to make this world a better place even if it is a tiny one. But to reach a goal, you need to start taking your steps right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UIPL, we always encourage this type of activity. Also, such gatherings help us to make our network stronger. Meeting new people comes with new opportunities. Thinking in this way helps us to grow together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t want to be the “Jack”, who is a “dull boy”! So, both work and play are important to us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that was all for our “Green Marathon” day out. I will keep you posted about our next events too. Till then you can follow us for any technology and development-related news, updates, releases, and guides.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all aspects of life now have been affected by the spread of COVID-19, popularly known as Coronavirus. Starting with China, the virus is slowly taking over the world, changing the social, economic and political aspects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eCommerce and supply chain industry are not exempted from the effect of this virus. The effects ranging from both good and bad, it is definitely interesting how it is changing the global eCommerce market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at all the ways Coronavirus is affecting the world of eCommerce and supply chain and how you can protect your eCommerce business and web development process from these effects. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19: The Negative Impacts On eCommerce Till Now</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most impactful negative effect until now is on the supply chain industry. Most of the major eCommerce organizations depend on Chinese regions as their manufacturing hub. And ever since quarantine on those regions began, these online retailers are suffering the most, losing almost a month of stocks. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12157 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-symptoms.jpg" alt="corona virus symptoms" width="645" height="430" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-symptoms.jpg 645w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-symptoms-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The online wearable market growth is going to slow down significantly this year, according to the experts. </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005755/en/Worldwide-Wearables-Market-Braces-Short-Term-Impact-Recovery"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 9.4% growth rate prediction is a significant drop from the 89% growth last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For more than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">75% eCommerce organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, quarantine, and transport restrictions have posed some serious threats to their business operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the worldwide effect, more than 44% of organizations are completely unprepared to handle the effects of this supply chain disruption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies now have to lower their expected rate of growth this year as more than half of organizations have trouble moving goods from China due to the widespread disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the effect of Coronavirus on eCommerce is not all negative. While some industries related to eCommerce, such as big fashion brands, machines, and gadgets are suffering from this supply chain disruption, there are some types of eCommerce businesses and organizations that are thriving. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19: The Positive Impacts On Ecommerce</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time of desperate needs always comes with some new innovative methods, and the eCommerce industry around the world is not. The methods that were considered to be optional or a waste of money until now are being considered as a lifesaver for multiple businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eCommerce segment related to grocery delivery as healthcare supply is being boosted due to the widespread quarantine in various regions of China, Italy, and the USA, customers are avoiding going to stores and opting for online delivery of groceries and healthcare essentials such as medicines, sanitizers, etc. along with this, the older generation is now switching to online shopping to avoid going to stores since COVID-19 is more fatal to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this time of panic, newer ways are being accepted and adopted by various business houses. Real estate firms are now using VR optimized website to sell more houses during the time of quarantine. Different companies are using various social channels such as Snapchat and Tiktoks to engage customers and drive more sales. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19: How To Deal With Such Impacts?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main reason why the eCommerce industry is so affected by the pandemic is that it never anticipated such a massive disease to sweep over the world, affecting every avenue of life like this. And as a result, the industry is going through such a decline without any ways of protecting itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are still a few eCommerce industries that are doing a great job of surviving. These are the companies that either took on proper precautions at the right time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, as an eCommerce startup, how are you going to be able to deal with such a massive and impactful incident? Whether we look at the recent scenario or think about the future possibility, what kind of precautions should you take to protect your eCommerce business? Well, here are a few suggestions for example. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversification Of The Supply Chain Centers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the eCommerce organizations are facing the supply chain crisis due to their centralized supply chain hub in China. If you are building your own eCommerce business, then make sure not to make the same mistake. Diversifying the supply chain centers in different locations will ensure that in the future, the supply of products to your customer is not hindered because of any kind of regional or global crisis. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Development And Design For All Age Groups </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since this crisis has shown some real changes in user behavior, having your eCommerce website designed for all kinds of age groups will give you a better chance at surviving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the development process make sure to hire an </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ecommerce-website-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce website development company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that knows how to design and develop a website that is able to complete the requirements of the customers of all age groups. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ease Of Navigation On Your Website</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since at times of crisis like this buyers are going to resort to online shopping as a whole, having easy navigation throughout the website is going to be immensely helpful to them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in normal times, a website with easy navigation is loved by buyers. With intuitive navigation you can turn your buyers into repeat customers, therefore increasing sales and staying afloat even during the time of crisis. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robust Web Structure</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the number of site visitors increase, your website should be able to take on the increased traffic rates. Whether you choose to go with website development or eCommerce app development without a strong web structure and hosting plan, your eCommerce website would not be able to handle the increasing traffic. This will cause an immense loss in business revenue and reputation. So make sure that your website has a strong web structure to handle the increased traffic rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealing with a pandemic such as this is not easy, and it is definitely not easy to deal with all the negative effects it is going to have on your business. But with the right process, attitude and innovative thinking, you can make sure that your business comes out of this economic crisis without any harm done to it. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when the season of Holi (the festival of colors), a group of extremely competitive people, and the tradition of rangoli come together? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why a Holi special Rangoli competition!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When our amazing HR team revealed the idea of the Rangoli competition to us on the 2nd of March, the entire office geared themselves up for a fun-filled competition. With 7 teams ready with colors and unique design, the competition on the 6th of March was not only fun but intense as well. </span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12111 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech.jpeg" alt="rangoli competition at unified infotech" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech.jpeg 1600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-competition-at-unified-infotech-1024x576.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there was only 30 minutes allotted for the entire competition, the atmosphere in the room was definitely charged. Teamwork became the most important thing to create rangolis in a fast and precise manner.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team B pouring all colours of effort and hard work into their rangoli.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not Just Competition, But A Chance To Have Fun</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted it was a competition, and of course, all of us wanted to win, but that doesn’t mean we didn’t have fun! With the colors and good company, the competition became more fun than ever! </span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12114 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F.jpeg" alt="rangoli team F" width="1056" height="792" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F.jpeg 1056w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rangoli-team-F-1024x768.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1056px) 100vw, 1056px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team A working together to win the competition. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Winners</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though each rangoli was a piece of unique art in itself, we had to pick three winning teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first place went to Team B. It was unsurprising because Team B mainly comprised of our best designers, and that makes it kind of obvious that they will be the ones to win the rangoli competition. Their design reflected the colorful spirit of the celebration itself. Not to mention they were the most prepared team of all, prepared with colors and design from the beginning. </span><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second place was grabbed by Team A. The enthusiasm, spirit, and experience in making rangolis paid off as they took the bag of goodies for second place in the competition. Their rangoli explored the unique blend of colors and the auspicious image of Ganesha was created to not only drive the team to do better in the competition, but also to bring good fortune to the company!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not the least, the third prize went to Team E for their amazing peacock rangoli. The peacock rangoli with the SCS INFO logo in the middle represented the idea of being one with the beauty and grace of the bird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rangoli competition was one of the many more festivities and celebrations to come this year.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any ordinary person, this is just a proverb, but for us at Unified Infotech, this is a mantra. Surely the brilliant minds that are at work here deserve a day of fun and relaxation. And that’s why on the 18th of January 2020, we set out for our annual picnic. Destination? Aqua Retreat at Falta.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing The Destination: Only The Best For Annual SCS INFO Picnic</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a lot of deliberation about the destination, but that’s only because when it comes to our annual picnic, we want only the best. This is why after a lot of deliberation, our organizer committee settled on the picaresque riverside resort &#8211; Aqua Retreat in the outskirts of Kolkata.  </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11705 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-1-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beautiful resort right beside the river Ganges was perfect for our day out. A perfect mix between nature and urban locality, our committee decided that it’ll be perfect for the SCS INFO annual picnic. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Journey Starts </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a wintery, foggy and chilly morning, but that doesn’t mean we were going to stop. The participants got to our office at Sector V, Saltlake as early as 7:00 am in the morning. The journey of bus one started at 8:00 am, while the Bus no. 2 started off at 8:30 am.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11737 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2.jpg" alt="SCS INFO picnic" width="1198" height="602" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2.jpg 1198w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2-300x151.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2-768x386.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-2-2-1024x515.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1198px) 100vw, 1198px" /></p>
<p>The way to the picnic spot was long (almost a 3-hour journey, can you imagine!?) but that doesn’t mean we sat idle. No, we made the bus journey a complete fun one with music and games. You can say that we were too excited!</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reaching The Destination</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure during the end of the 3-hour long bus journey, everyone was getting a little antsy. But as soon as that first glance of the river came into view, we knew we were close there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of the place was enough to stun us. The bright sun, the clear sky and the beautiful sight of the river were enough to promise us that the day was going to be an amazing one. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11708 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1204" height="903" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-4-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being thoroughly awestruck by the sheer beauty, we decided that this is a day that demands to be seized in the best possible way. So after breakfast (which was really amazing by the way!), we set out to have fun the SCS INFO way (which is a synonym for hardcore fun for us.)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having Fun SCS INFO Style!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work hard and we party equally hard. And when it comes to our annual picnic, you can bet there will be action-packed tournaments and matches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we started off with a power charged badminton match. As our players got more and more into the game, it was impossible to tell who was going to win. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11709 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1204" height="1372" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5-263x300.jpg 263w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5-768x875.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Unified-Infotech-picnic-image-5-899x1024.jpg 899w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus and fun, our players proved that they can do both. As they fought hard to win, they also had an immense amount of fun playing the match. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11710 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-2.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1204" height="677" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-2.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the highly competitive badminton match, cooling down was necessary. And when it comes to relaxing in style, no one does it better than us at Unified Infotech. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11712 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat" width="1204" height="803" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01662-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the matches were going on, some decided to be the audience and relax on the balcony overlooking the stunning scenery of the river. Another batch decided to just go inside for an impromptu hangout with good food, good music and amazing company of each other.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pool Side Fun</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was a winter day, as the day progressed, the temperature rose a little high. And that became the perfect reason for us to move the party to the poolside. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11716 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat pool side fun" width="1204" height="803" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01685-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an impromptu swimming contest (we have no idea who won btw!) to just chilling beside the pool with friends/colleagues, the poolside party became one of the most amazing highlights of the day.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lunch</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the snacks and appetizers served on the first part of the day, it goes without saying that everyone was famished by the time lunch rolled around. It probably had something to do with the amazing food and having too much fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lunch went swimmingly, picnic participants (those who were done with lunch) decided on taking a stroll around the resort and get some amazing scenery shots. By looking at the photos, you can say we have some pro photographers here at Unified Infotech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simple boat on the water makes for an excellent shot.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11718 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4.jpg" alt="SCS INFO Picnic 2020 at Aqua Retreat picture clicked by Surajit" width="1152" height="864" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4.jpg 1152w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-4-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the sun sets on the horizon, it turns the entire atmosphere into an amazing shade of pink and golden. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not Just A Picnic, But An Opportunity To Bond</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though to many, a picnic is just a picnic, for us at SCS INFO it is a bonding opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a strong believer in the fact that without proper bonding between team members, you can not run the team. And with this small yet significant event, our team became even closer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether we are talking about members of the SCS INFO family who have been here for years, or newcomers, after the picnic, there was no telling, because of the increased bond among us all.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11719 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955.jpg" alt="Selfie time" width="1204" height="903" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG20200118171955-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you tell from the above picture that there are two fresh newcomers in it? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11720 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008.jpg" alt="Picnic Spot" width="1152" height="532" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008.jpg 1152w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008-768x355.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-20200123-WA0008-1024x473.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old and the new blended together during this event. The bond between the SCS INFO team became stronger, which led us a few more steps closer to achieving our goals of becoming the best in our field.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Day Comes To An End</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saddest thing about the best of the days is the fact that they come to an end. And so did this day. As the sun started dipping in the sky, we too realized that it was time to pack up, both the things we brought with us to the spot, and the amazing memories we made, and start on our way back home. But not without a last group photo! </span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11721 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719.jpg" alt="SCS INFO team picnic" width="1204" height="803" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719.jpg 1204w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSC01719-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure we were all a tad bit sad about the day ending. How amazing would it be if we could continue having fun forever!! But that’s not how it goes. So we packed up our stuff, said goodbye to the amazing place, and made a resolution to make the next picnic even better, even more fun, and even more memorable than this one.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moments That Took Our Breath Away!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some amazing moments that took our breath away, and since we care about you all, we thought about sharing as well! Take a look.</span></p>

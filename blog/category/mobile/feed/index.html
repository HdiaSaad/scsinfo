										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s talk about <a href="https://www.quibi.com/" target="_blank">Quibi</a>, the American short movie platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The ambitious streaming platform, launched in 2020 April, was made for people on the go. It offered shows with 5-10 minutes long episodes. It garnered a lot of attention, and even a massive $1.75 billion investment. But its journey was cut short in December 2020 due to a lack of subscribers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-post-mortem/">later post mortem</a> revealed the main reason for Quibi’s failure- the lack of an MVP approach. The platform tried to compete against streaming service giants during the height of pandemic times, with a not-so-unique idea. Had they used an MVP software development approach and assessed the market before launching, the story might’ve ended differently.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MVP development enables you to launch a product with minimal features, enough to fulfill the basic needs of the users. This way, you can gather data on consumers, the market, and validate your business idea before investing more resources. Remember- to avoid disastrous endings like Quibi, an MVP approach is mandatory.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But how do you proceed with MVP software development? Let’s unravel the secrets of this approach one by one in the following points.</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. The Distinctions Of The MVP Software Development</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One search online would reveal that there are all sorts of minimal approach terms related to MVP. So before we get started on the discussion of how do you develop an MVP, let’s look at these related terms and consider how they relate to each other.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. MVP [Minimum Viable product]</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first and perhaps the most popular minimal approach is MVP.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Used first in <a href="https://www.oberlo.in/blog/lean-startup">Eric Ries’ book Lean Startup</a>, an MVP product development is a perfect approach for you to validate your business idea. It is not the first version of your digital product, rather a platform with minimal features, coding, and design. This can be a landing page that helps you learn about what kind of consumers are attracted to your business. Additionally, it can also be an app with a basic feature aimed at solving a core problem of the users.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13271 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-853x1024.jpg" alt="MVP software development" width="853" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-853x1024.jpg 853w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-250x300.jpg 250w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-768x922.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-1279x1536.jpg 1279w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-05-1706x2048.jpg 1706w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The MVP is in no way meant to be a long-lasting solution. It is part of the B.M.L method. One is supposed to build an MVP, measure the feedback gathered from it, learn from that accumulated feedback and then enhance the platform with that learning. It helps the entrepreneurs to understand the unique problems the users are facing, and come up with unique solutions.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. MMP [Minimum Marketable Product]</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">MMP, also known as minimum marketable product or minimum shippable product, happens to be similar to MVP, but a little different at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the approach of minimal resources and effort investment stays the same, the approach towards the longevity of the platform changes. An MVP app development is only supposed to be used for experiment and feedback gathering purposes. On the other hand, MMP is supposed to provide real value to the users, from the very initial stage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Created using some must-have features, an MMP is a digital product that can be marketed and sold to the users out there. Whether it is a <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-app-development/">web app development</a> or a site, with such a platform, users can complete the task they set out to do, and entrepreneurs can gather data and earn revenue at the same time. An MMP is simply the marketable version of the MVP approach.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. MDP [Minimum Desirable Product]</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Minimal desirable products are one step ahead of the MVP approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the MVP services come with many benefits, you can hardly excite and attract users with them. Even with an MMP approach, the best you’d be able to do is to gather more feedback from the users on what more features the product needs. Very few would stick around until the platform becomes better, most will leave without a second glance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the minimum desirable product, you can use exciting UX/UI elements to hook the users from the beginning, no matter how little the platform does. The additional aspect of user-centricity turns the simple MVP into a minimum valuable product. The MDP approach will help you to attract and retain users from the very beginning.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Expert speaks: For a startup, it is crucial to acquire and retain users from the very beginning. Our experts suggest that as a new entrant into the market, going to an MDP approach will be the best possible way. With this, you can offer the clients a valuable experience and features that will solve their problems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. The Relations Between The Minimal Approaches: A Brief Overview</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are thinking that it doesn’t really matter which one of the above approaches you choose, then think again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite being closely related, the three kinds of minimal approach have their own distinction as well. So let’s explore exactly how they are related, and how they differ.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. The Relationship</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s look at the relationship first.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MVP, MDP, and MMP are the steps of the MVP software development process to create a product that is ready for launch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Through careful MVP solutions are created and launched into the market to accumulate user feedback. This feedback not only consists of data on what type of consumers are being attracted to the platform. It also contains information on what kind of features, UI/UX requirements they are looking for, as well as the extra value that might retain them for a long time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Heeding this feedback, the developers can enhance the platform, the MVP user experience, and improve the overall experience to make the product more desirable, therefore more prone to success. From here it is only a few modifications away to turn it into a minimally marketable product that can be officially launched into the market and earn revenue.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. The Differences</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are multiple differences between the three MVP software development approaches.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the main purpose of development to the time and cost, all these differences make the MVP solutions vary widely from one another. And these differences are also the reason why most companies tend to choose a singular minimal approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here’s a compact look at all the major differences between MVP, MDP &amp; MMP-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13266" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-776x1024.jpg" alt="MVP software development" width="776" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-776x1024.jpg 776w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-227x300.jpg 227w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-768x1014.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-1164x1536.jpg 1164w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-1551x2048.jpg 1551w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1-scaled.jpg 1939w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now that you have a comprehensive idea about the relationship and differences between the three kinds of minimal approach, it’s time to talk about the perfect process of developing an MVP.</p>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. How To Develop The Perfect MVP: Our Process</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many consider MVP to be dead. On the other hand, many think startup MVP development is the only way to launch an idea into the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But which opinion is the right opinion?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, as the tech partners of numerous ideas that achieved staggering progress in their industry, we can vouch that the MVP approach is truly, not dead. But the process of MVP development has changed. Previously, entrepreneurs would take the most minimal approach while developing, resulting in a product that barely fulfilled user needs. The hyper fixation with minimalism in MVP software development has changed now. More and more <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">web development companies</a> these days are focusing on creating a viable product with minimal effort so that the initial business requirements can be fulfilled.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Kicking Off With A Look Into The Market</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A product, digital or not, must fit into the kind of needs and wants the target users to have. Failing to do so will result in catastrophic failure. <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/">According to research</a>, more than 42% of times a startup fails because their product was not needed in the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As an experienced MVP development company, we begin with a complete market analysis. The research includes the core problem the digital product is aiming to solve, the already available solutions in the market, how they serve or fail to serve the target demographic, and what kind of unique valuation the users are looking for.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">More information means better chances of success right off the bat. Knowing the market, the users, and the competitors gives us and our clients a solid foundation, to begin with. This way we can determine what the minimum viable product software development needs to succeed.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Consider The Value Addition</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The prevalence of digital solutions has made it almost impossible to break into the market successfully. There are simply way too many solutions for one problem, all of them more or less the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that’s why the next step of MVP project management &amp; development is the value addition/idea validation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13269 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-803x1024.jpg" alt="MVP software development" width="803" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-803x1024.jpg 803w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-235x300.jpg 235w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-768x979.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-1205x1536.jpg 1205w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-1606x2048.jpg 1606w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1-scaled.jpg 2008w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The MVP software development stage is all about giving the target demographic the first taste of your unique idea that solves problems more efficiently than other solutions available. And that’s why despite it being the minimal effort stage the idea needs to be implemented well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this stage, we take a look at the possible competitors, and what they are doing. This way we can pinpoint the exact gaps left by the industry rivals and how the solution can fulfill those gaps. After creating a one-of-a-kind value offering document for the idea, we then move onto the next stage of the MVP development, which is mapping the user flow.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Expert Speaks: To make a unique MVP, you must start with a unique idea. However, that unique idea must solve a major problem. So focus on the problem you are aiming to solve and analyze the market to see what kind of solutions are already available. Doing this will save you a lot of rethinking &amp; reworking at a later stage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Mapping Out The User Flow</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Granted that MVP product development includes only the basic features and functionalities. But that does not mean it is okay to completely ignore the design flow. To understand the unique offering which is your idea, the users need to be able to use the platform (app or web) properly. And this is where the third stage comes in.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our process of building a minimum valuable product includes a user-centric point of view where we first document the major pain points they face while trying to solve a problem using one of the existing solutions. And then we design a user flow on the MVP platform that solves the pain points and empowers them to fulfill their tasks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this stage, we make use of our UX &amp; <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/website-design/">web design expertise</a> and map out an intuitive user flow from the beginning to the end of the journey on the platform. Our design teams implement design best practices and policies that give the platform a polished experience from the first stage.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">D. Set The Feature Priorities Right</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The key stage of MVP development, feature sorting is one of the many things that determine how successful the minimally viable product is going to be. Failing to decide on the essential features during this stage can put the entire future of the product at risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Out of the many methods of prioritizing features, we stand by the user story mapping process. A part of our MVP agile development process, it helps us to list the essential MVP features that help the product accomplish its goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13268 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-558x1024.jpg" alt="MVP software development" width="558" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-558x1024.jpg 558w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-164x300.jpg 164w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-768x1409.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-837x1536.jpg 837w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-1116x2048.jpg 1116w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1-scaled.jpg 1395w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here’s how we approach the feature sorting process with our well-defined user story mapping process-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Step 1</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">We begin with the goals the user wants to accomplish with the digital product. Whether it is signing up on the platform, or performing any other task- we start by listing out the possible goals the product will help the users to achieve.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Step 2:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once we have listed the goals, we divide them into activities. The activities are the tasks a user must complete to accomplish their goal- like registering with the right credentials to create an account on the platform.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Step 3:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the activities are assigned under each goal, it is time to break down the activities into smaller user stories. These user stories are various actions users perform on the platform to achieve certain goals. During MVP development, these stories are sorted from the highest priority to the lowest priority accordingly.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">E. Follow Through With BML (build, measure, learn) Model</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">An MVP is in no way the final product. No matter how desirable experience it offers or how much revenue it is earning from the day it was launched, you must continuously improve the product through MVP programming. And that’s why this stage is an integral part of our MVP development lifecycle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13270" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-915x1024.jpg" alt="" width="915" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-915x1024.jpg 915w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-268x300.jpg 268w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-768x859.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-1373x1536.jpg 1373w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1-1830x2048.jpg 1830w" sizes="(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As one of the skilled MVP development services in the industry, we measure the impact made by the product once it is launched into the market. This measuring process provides us with insight into how well the product is helping the audience, where it is failing, and what more the audience expects from it. With all this information, we get back to work again and start implementing the acquired knowledge to improve the platform for the better.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The entire process, from the first stage to the last, is conducted by keeping the users &amp; business goals in mind. The success of the MVP process depends on striking a harmony between the two, and our process adheres to that rule at all costs.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. MVP Benefits: Why Should You Even Go Through All The Trouble?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why even go to all the trouble?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why not develop the entire platform in one go, launch it into the market, and hope for the best? Well, doing so will seriously hurt the chances of business success. And that’s why it is better to go for an MVP software development approach at the initial stages of the development.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a few more MVP business benefits to convince you about the effectiveness of this approach.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A. Affordability</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">First comes the benefit of affordability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whether you happen to be a startup entrepreneur or an established business owner, your aim must be to get your tech initiatives off the ground with minimal waste of resources. And for that MVP is the perfect approach. Affordable MVP development cost, in combination with the iterative process, makes for an encouraging environment for the development and success of your tech idea.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">B. Validating The Market Demand</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the major reasons for business failure is having little to no market demand for the product you are trying to sell.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sure your idea may be unique, and it may be able to help the people, but is there a market for it? The MVP programming, which begins with comprehensive industry analysis will save you from all the market failure-related trouble. You can get access to information on what kind of digital solutions already exist, how they help the users, and how your solutions are different. Having and using all this information, you have a better chance to succeed in the industry.</p>

</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">C. Testing Out The Business Concept</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Launching the idea without testing it is like taking a blind leap off of a mountain cliff. The idea and business revenue model should go through rigorous testing before the launch. And once again MVP app design offers you the time window to test the business concept, tweak it for better results, and then launch it when you feel like it will generate the expected results.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">D. Examining The Impact Of The Product</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The MVP prototype helps to understand the kind of impact the product will have on the target market. After launch, we apply the B.M.L method and measure the impact of the platform on the target users. This information will then help us to improve the product and enhance its future impact on the industry and users.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">E. Building An Early Relationship With The Customers</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Modern businesses and solutions must be customer-centric to succeed. With MVP product management, one can build an early connection with the target consumers. With their feedback, the consumers will inadvertently become part of the development process. This will make them feel more invested in the overall success of the solution. This way you can effortlessly make the entire process consumer-centric.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">It Is Easy To Achieve Skyrocketing Success With A Modern Day MVP Approach!</h2>

The compact tablet-smartphone hybrid is now an intriguing piece of phenomena in the tech world. However, the uniqueness of foldable smartphone app development is leaving a lot of app developers and designers baffled.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13229" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13229 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash-1024x684.jpg" alt="folding smartphone display" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mika-baumeister-vI8_06RmSC0-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13229" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Photo by Mika Baumeister on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">New entrepreneurs and app development companies all over the globe are now wondering how to design and develop apps for these new smartphones. Surely, as the phones change, so will the well-established rules of development. But the question is- how much is it going to change?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, if you are one of those who are wondering about </span>such apps<span style="font-weight: 400;">, then you are at the right place. Our in-house experts have conducted in-depth research on the design/development process for new smartphones, and we are going to discuss it here. Are you ready? Let&#8217;s begin.</span></p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. New Era Smartphones: What Are They Bringing To The Fold?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Foldable smartphones are taking over the market rapidly. The popularity has reached such a monumental peak that according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/983531/global-foldable-phone-shipments/">forecast</a>, by 2022 global foldable shipment numbers would reach a staggering 50.1 million units.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13231 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-938x1024.jpg" alt="foldable smartphone app development" width="938" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-938x1024.jpg 938w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-275x300.jpg 275w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-768x839.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1407x1536.jpg 1407w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-01-1876x2048.jpg 1876w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/foldable-smartphone-market">another source</a>, the foldable smartphone industry is also supposed to grow at a CAGR rate of over 21.3% throughout the forecast period of 2021-2026. All these stats are pointing towards the only fact- the fold is the future of the smartphone industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The new style of devices provides not just space and comfort of use, but it also offers more screen real estate, more versatile use of apps, and true streamlining of the workflow. The expectations for these devices are high, but they also challenge the basic app development process uniquely.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s take a look at these challenges, shall we?</p>

<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Challenges Of The Foldable Smartphone App Development</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Folded or unfolded, the new-age smartphones come with lots of features and functionalities. However, these expanded use cases are challenging many <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development/">app development company</a> in new ways. Here’s a comprehensive list of all the issues our in-house experts deem more important to pay attention to-</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. App Continuity</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Continuity issues are one of the major app development challenges for foldable phones. It is all about an app switching from one state to another based on the orientation of the screen. For example, an individual using the phone in a folded state might suddenly want to unfold the phone for better usability. And when they do that, the app they were using should switch to fit the expanded screen without missing a beat.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/5jSZQR3eK6RFWbFJbP" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/5jSZQR3eK6RFWbFJbP">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only the app needs to fit the newly folded/unfolded screen, but the </span>app features<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and content also need to scale accordingly. So far, it is one of the major challenges app designers and developers are facing with </span>foldable smartphone app development<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Ratio Awkwardness</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because Apple has not yet brought forward any foldable iPhone news, most of the phones in this segment are Android. And when it comes to building an app for Android phones the aspect ratio challenges are many. There are numerous devices, each with varying screen sizes. And with foldable, the difficulties for any <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/">Android app development company</a> have increased tenfold.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13232 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-669x1024.jpg" alt="foldable smartphone app development" width="669" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-669x1024.jpg 669w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-768x1175.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1004x1536.jpg 1004w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-1338x2048.jpg 1338w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-02-scaled.jpg 1673w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The foldable phones support multiple screen ratios, both in the folded and unfolded state. Based on the type of fold and multi-tasking functionality, the mobile app UX designs need to fit multiple ratios and work perfectly without breaking the rhythm. Additionally, the size and shape of foldable smartphones are <a href="http://www.nathancunn.com/2018-11-09-foldable-phones/">causing some awkwardness in screen/ app ratios</a> especially when it comes to consuming media through smartphones. <span style="font-weight: 400;">And this increases the number of challenges faced by </span>foldable smartphone app development<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. Multi-Window Functionality</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the multi-window functionality, the users can run several apps side by side. However, facilitating this can be tricky. Earlier, while using two or more apps on the same screen, the active app will run while the others would be paused. But now </span>foldable smartphone app design <span style="font-weight: 400;">enables users to run multiple apps on the same screen simultaneously.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The information sharing, along with the aspect ratio scaling, poses some serious challenges for any web app development company out there. To make an app work well, they have to make sure that it works well simultaneously with the other apps on the same screen perfectly.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. UI Changes Feature Accessibility Limitations</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Besides folding screens, smartphones today also sport multiple screens. The folded version of phones such as Galaxy Z Fold 2 comes with a narrow screen on the top, and when unfolded displays a bigger screen that almost resembles a tablet.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13233" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13233" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13233 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/merlin_166842705_bc10c164-c7f3-49dd-aafe-f83095958047-jumbo.png" alt="folding smartphone apps" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/merlin_166842705_bc10c164-c7f3-49dd-aafe-f83095958047-jumbo.png 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/merlin_166842705_bc10c164-c7f3-49dd-aafe-f83095958047-jumbo-300x200.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/merlin_166842705_bc10c164-c7f3-49dd-aafe-f83095958047-jumbo-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13233" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://www.nytimes.com</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the dual displays on such devices improve efficiency, it creates certain issues for the accessibility of features and functionalities of the application. What kind of features would be accessible through the small screen? What kind of mobile app UX design will be better suited for the bigger screen? All these and more feature/functionality-related questions haunt the app developers and designers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">e. The Spine</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spine, a.k.a where the smartphone folds are posing another design issue. Whether it is an inward folding phone or outward folding screens, the spine can cause the </span>app features<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to wrap and get displaced. All in all, the spine of the device can create foldable smartphone app development challenges that are never before seen for app builders.</span></p>

<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. Unified Infotech’s Solutions For Foldable Smartphone App Design</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Considering all the design and development challenges, any custom app development company you partner up with has to be a master of the craft. Today app development is not only about following the best practices, but also innovating continuously. How is it done though? Let us give you a peek inside our process of designing for the foldable smartphone-</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Examining The Use Cases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">For foldable, we begin the app development process with the expected use case scenarios.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Different apps have different purposes and can be used either in a folded state or in an unfolded state (in the case of multi-display smartphones). So we need to begin our design process by analyzing exactly how the users would utilize your app.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use case examination enables us to better conceptualize the </span>foldable smartphone app design <span style="font-weight: 400;">and wireframe. Additionally, it also enables us to optimize the development process accordingly.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Extensive Wireframing</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">As an experienced mobile app development company, we give the wireframe process ample attention to make the process successful. And when it comes to designing for foldable, we double down on our efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">App wireframing is a process of mapping out how the content and design elements would look on-screen and how the users would navigate. Our extensive mobile app UX design also includes the transitioned screens of the app. From the look and feel of folded/unfolded screens to the navigation elements- we map it all out.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. Making Use Of Screen Real Estate</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the many plus points of </span>foldable smartphone app development<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the increased screen size.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13234 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1024x1001.jpg" alt="foldable smartphone app development" width="1024" height="1001" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1024x1001.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-300x293.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-768x751.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-1536x1502.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-03-2048x2003.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the increased screen sizes, we can now incorporate more </span>foldable smartphone app design <span style="font-weight: 400;">elements and content on the app screens without making them crowded. We make full use of the increased space, creating </span>UX mockups and UI elements <span style="font-weight: 400;">that will use the increased space well without making the users overwhelmed with a crowded screen.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. Reducing UI/UX Roadblocks</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite the bigger screen, there are plenty of UI/UX roadblocks that we must deal with to make the foldable android app usable. And the most important of those is the one/two-handed use of the device.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The extended screen size makes it impossible for people to use the smartphone one-handed. So, sometimes they must switch to two-handed mode. And during mobile app design &amp; development, we ensure that the navigation and the design elements are distributed accordingly for an enhanced experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The initial use case examination stage helps us to understand when the user would be switching to full-size screens and when they would be using the app in the folded state. With this insight, we focus on placing the crucial feature element at the core areas of the screen. During the app development process for foldable phones, we work to enhance the usability of secondary screens as well. Our careful wireframing process ensures that the screen doesn’t look too overcrowded and the users can make the most of the app even on the smaller screen.</p>

<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. Unified’s Foldable Smartphone App Development Solutions</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Foldable apps might be simple android apps, but they do come with certain technical challenges that seem daunting. But as an experienced app development company, we are well aware of how to deal with such challenges. So let’s see how they view these following roadblocks to developing an android app and solve them daily.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Using Simple Transition</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In our <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/">Agile development process</a>, we treat the issue of app continuity just like app transition from portrait to landscape mode. Only in this case, the transition happens from the folded state to unfolded state.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The expectations are clear- while using the app, the user would change the orientation of the phone from folded to unfolded or the other way around, and the app would switch accordingly while retaining the same data as before. To accomplish this, our application development process uses methods like Saving the UI state and making use of the ViewModel.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Multi-Window Support</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Facilitating multi-window support is hectic enough. And on top of that users now expect all the apps open on the same screen to be in a resumed state. To facilitate this mode during foldable android app development, our developers first make sure that the app is resizable by defining resizeableActivity=true in the manifest. This tells the system that the app is resizable and will play nice in the unfolded multi-window mode.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13235 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-814x1024.jpg" alt="foldable smartphone app development" width="814" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-814x1024.jpg 814w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-238x300.jpg 238w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-768x967.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1220x1536.jpg 1220w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-1627x2048.jpg 1627w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-04-scaled.jpg 2034w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This compatibility is integrated throughout all the components of the app, including but not limited to all activities, services, etc. Additionally, through drag and drop permission, our developers enable the users to share information between different apps with ease.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. Consider The Aspect Ratio</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The new foldable phones pose one of the biggest aspect ratio issues in app development. The matter of aspect ratio for foldable smartphones is related to the screen sizes, screen orientations, state of the smartphone as well as multi-window support. To support the app in any aspect ratio, our developers make use of ConstraintLayout. It enables them to create bigger and more complex layouts with variable ratios that fit into the expectation of users.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. Extensive Testing And Quality Checks</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The new smartphones are still not entirely reliable. These devices are still in that trial and error phase, with new changes appearing almost every release. So it goes without saying that the app development process for these devices will also be subjected to rigorous testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the device testing, which ensures that the app is supported by a plethora of devices both foldable and unfoldable, we put the app through basic tests. As a </span>foldable smartphone app development company, <span style="font-weight: 400;">our aim is to build apps that work smoothly without any hassle. And our testing process enables us to accomplish this flawlessly.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">To Get To The Market Top, Take Advantage Of The Fold Today!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite all the UI/UX challenges and build-related questions, foldable smartphones are gaining momentum. So don’t wait, be the early bird, and optimize your app for foldable support today.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the UI/UX design world, wireframes are like blueprints. Whether it is a website or a mobile app, UX wireframe design is the most necessary step.</p>
<p>Whether you are a new entrepreneur, or an experienced businessman, wireframing is something you&#8217;ve heard of. It is the basic rough sketch made before the product goes in for complete design and development.</p>
<p>But is that all there is to wireframing?</p>
<p>When it comes to achieving the client&#8217;s design dreams, a product design wireframe is the first step we take. And we can tell from experience that wireframing is not just a basic rough sketch. So what more is it? Let&#8217;s explore!</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: justify;">1. What Is Wireframe Design?</h2>
<p>The static skeletal foundation, a.k.a wireframes are the base of any creative design operation. The barebone versions of platform UI helps designers &amp; developers to understand some key factors. These factors include but are not limited to- core functionality, features, basic navigation flow, and the overall impact of the idea on the end-user.</p>
<p>It is a popular opinion that the wireframe design process is not detail-oriented, but that is not true. When it comes to this specific process, the devil lies in the right details. It is a process that deals with the visual aspect of the entire process. And that&#8217;s why designers must pay attention to user needs and journey-related information.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13208" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-1024x768.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_8-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Having the users in mind from the very beginning helps us to create an impactful design. Our skilled team of designers uses this part of modern web design to determine the navigation flow of the platform. In doing so, we can examine the user flow within the platform from very early on. The black &amp; white framework, made with simple boxes and lines represents design elements and content hierarchy. It is the perfect way of getting client approval on the design concept before beginning the process.</p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Expert speaks</strong>: Rather than focusing on visual details, it is more critical to pay attention to interaction, information hierarchy &amp; content placement. So don’t fret too much about how the finished product will look. Rather focus on the right placement design elements during this stage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: justify;">2. Why Is Wireframing A Must?</h2>
<p>Surely the design process for your business platform can proceed without wireframing. So why is it an essential element practiced by almost every <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/website-design/">modern web design company</a>?</p>
<p>There are many benefits of this simple method. And these benefits make wireframing a vital part of design success. So let us list out a few reasons why we think it is important to design app wireframes before development.</p>
<h3>A. Provides A Solid Design Foundation</h3>
<p>Having a well-defined material design wireframe gives our designers a solid foundation to work on. The wireframe blueprint assists us to recognize the core functionality of the platform, and design an impactful UI that matches its purpose.</p>
<h3>B. Helps Gather Feedback &amp; Implement Them</h3>
<p>During our kick-off &amp; analytical stage, we use UI/UX design wireframes to gather valuable client opinions. This feedback gives us deeper insight into our client&#8217;s requirements and enables us to build a better platform.</p>
<h3>C. Reduces The Chance Of Costly Redesign</h3>
<p>A client-approved landing page wireframe design works as the perfect guide to creating designs that are impactful for a long time. And that&#8217;s why we use this step to ensure the clients don&#8217;t have to go through a costly redesign process later on.</p>
<h3>D. Increases Functional Efficiency From An Early Stage</h3>
<p>Software design wireframes help us to map out the navigational flow, which in turn improves the overall functional efficiency of the platform. With this step, we ensure that the consumers find the necessary information on the platform easily.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: justify;">3. A Step-By-Step Look The Types Of Wireframes</h2>
<p>Based on the detailing, we can distinguish three different kinds of wireframe design-</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-fidelity</li>
<li>Mid fidelity</li>
<li>High fidelity</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see what each of these include-</p>
<h3>A. Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
<p>Low-fidelity wireframes outline what the basic interface looks like. These rough sketches, mostly done with pen and paper, help to begin the design conversation between the clients and the designers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13209" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-1024x768.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As rough sketches, this kind of user experience design wireframes lacks the image and color element. Low-fidelity frameworks are used to understand and map out the interface, as well as the user flow from one page to another. It also helps to decide quickly between multiple design concepts. In brief, low-fidelity wireframing is where all <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">web development company</a> begin work.</p>
<h3>B. Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
<p>Mid-fidelity wireframe web designs are a bit higher in quality. These are interface frameworks without the final branding elements. With mid-fidelity frameworks, the clients get an understanding of how the final design would look like.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13210" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-1024x768.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_3-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>With mid-fidelity wireframes, designers can try out different styles of content hierarchy. These frameworks use darker shades to emphasize different types of content. It is the digitized version of low-fidelity wireframes that helps to finalize the framework before the design components are added.</p>
<h3>C. High-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
<p>High-fidelity frameworks include all the suggestions and changes conveyed in the earlier steps. It is one of the most important steps to design a website. And that&#8217;s why high-fidelity frameworks include necessary design &amp; branding elements such as images, fonts, and colors.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13211" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-1024x768.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_4-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The type of content on high-fidelity wireframes might vary from filler content to relevant content. However, the font sizes and style of this framework represent the actual IA that’ll be present on the business platform.</p>
<p>The three levels of the wireframe design process must be followed to craft an empowering design. Missing one might cause certain problems for the next stage. So ensure that the partner web design agency follows all the steps before beginning development.</p>

<p class="title"><strong>Expert Speaks</strong>: While you can skip the mid-fidelity stage, we suggest you don’t. It stands as the bridge between low-fidelity and high-fidelity stages and provides you with a better look at how the suggested design would look on screen, reducing reiterations and costs.</p>

<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: justify;">4. How To Make A Wireframe: The Best Practices We Follow</h2>
<p>Considering all its perks, wireframe design happens to be one of the most prioritized parts of our process. The in-house experts use wireframing to begin the discussion with our clients, flesh out design concepts, and finalize the visual layout before beginning development.</p>
<p>However, it is not easy to create wireframes for websites &amp; <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/custom-software-development/">custom software development</a> purposes. And that’s why we follow some of the most important best practices while creating the visual blueprint for your website. So let us talk about those best practices and why we practice them.</p>
<h3>A. Imbibe Clarity</h3>
<p>One of the main purposes of wireframes is to imbibe clarity in the modern web design process. From setting clear expectations to clarifying the visual layout of the interface- we follow this best practice to ensure the impact of wireframing on the entire process.</p>
<p>It is also the time when we try to clear out any and every query both clients and our design team might have. From the design approach embraced by us to the specific visual impact, the clients are looking for all the questions are answered during this stage.</p>
<h3>B. Empower Users With Confidence</h3>
<p>We believe that a good design empowers the users. And that’s why we begin with a familiar and intentional navigational approach from the very beginning of the wireframing method.</p>
<p>By implementing a user flow that is familiar to users, we lower the learning curve. While planning the wireframes of the core pages, such as the home page or contact pages, we frame the content and place buttons on the familiar and easy to spot for enhanced navigation. This way, before the website development process has even finished, we begin to empower the end-users.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>C. Keep It Simple</h3>
<p>Wireframes are the skeleton version of the UI. And that’s why we focus on keeping it simple. Rather than integrating too many details from the beginning, we start with a barebones version.</p>
<p>We begin wireframe design with a complete paper prototype that hashes out the very basic layout. Then we move onto mid-fidelity wireframes that are detailed enough to understand how the basic hierarchy and elements would look like. Unlike the final stage of the high-fi framework, these two steps focus solely on the placement of the visual element, nothing else.</p>
<h3>D. Consider Screen Sizes</h3>
<p>No matter what kind of business platform it is, screen size is something we must pay attention to. Our agile web design process begins with a mobile-first approach. The in-house design team creates wireframes for all supported devices and then considers how the content will scale based on the screen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13212" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-1024x804.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="804" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-1024x804.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-300x235.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-768x603.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-1536x1206.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_5-2048x1607.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<div class="related-post-box">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title"><strong>Expert speaks:</strong> Wireframe sizes differ based on the project. For web platforms, you will need an appropriate approach, but for a native mobile app, you’ll have to be specific regarding the OS, and the variations of devices. So sort out the matter of supported devices before beginning.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>E. Think Of Different User Scenarios</h3>
<p>One platform might have multiple user scenarios. Every individual experience the same platform in a different manner. And that’s why we examine all possible user scenarios while thinking about how to create wireframes.</p>
<p>Such user scenarios include but are not limited to- which access points the user entered the page from, what users are looking for based on the demographic details, what device they are using, etc. Examining these user scenarios helps us to craft improved layouts and navigational elements.</p>
<h3>F. Conduct Research</h3>
<p>One of the main best practices we follow is the research-based approach. Outlining a wireframe is not a simple task, and to ensure success, we need to have a clear understanding of the core functionality of the platform, basic features, as well as the users and their pain points.</p>
<p>To get a clear idea about all these, we begin with in-depth research. Covering all the necessary bases, we can integrate the essential elements of knowledge in planning the layout. The result: faster wireframe design &amp; approval process.</p>
<h3>G. Use Annotations For Clear Communications</h3>
<p>The wireframe prototype design is an effective yet challenging process. The major challenge at this stage is the clarity of communication. The lack of relevant branding/visual elements within the wireframe often confuses the clients about the result. And to solve this, we make use of annotations within the framework.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13213 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-1024x768.jpg" alt="explaining the wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_6-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The short notes provide important descriptions of the features functionalities, user flow, etc. With eye-catching and numbered notes, we aim to clarify any kind of miscommunication from the beginning.</p>
<h3>H. Increase Wireframe Fidelity Slowly</h3>
<p>The gradual improvements made to the wireframe design help us to focus on one thing at a time. In the low-fi stage, we focus on crafting the basic layout of the platform. The mid-fidelity stage is when we try to fix the content hierarchy issues. And hi-fi stage is when we implement the branding elements to see how the platform will look like.</p>
<p>This step-by-step improvement ensures that the process is focused, and not all over the place. Each stage has its purpose and the incremental enhancements ensure no detail is forgotten.</p>
<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: justify;">5. Common Wireframing Challenges &amp; How We Deal With Them!</h2>
<p>Even this simple process comes with plenty of trials. Here are some of the most common difficulties we meet while creating wireframes and how we deal with those challenges.</p>
<h3>A. The Eternal Debate Of Polished Vs. Rough Sketch</h3>
<p>The first challenge deals with making changes to the web development process.</p>
<p>The well-known laws of UI/UX dictate that we must always present the polished wireframe to the clients. However, experience has taught us something else. We have seen that presenting a too polished wireframe makes the clients more reluctant to suggest changes. Perhaps because they like it the way it is, or maybe because they feel that the design is finalized. In any case, it causes some serious issues in the later stages of design.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13214 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-1024x768.jpg" alt="wireframe design" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_7-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>With a three-step website wireframe design, we bypass this issue altogether. This way, the clients don&#8217;t feel too pressured to agree to the pixel-perfect framework and suggest changes freely. And we use those feedback and gradually improve upon the wireframe- from paper prototypes, to mid and then hi-fi frameworks.</p>

</div>
<h3>B. Which Pages To Wireframe?</h3>
<p>Wireframe UX design may be a necessary element. But at the same time, it is important to determine for which pages we must design the wireframes. We cannot make wireframes for every page on the website. And that’s why we begin by making up wireframes for the most important pages first.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13215 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-1024x768.jpg" alt="priority of wireframes in desigining" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wireframe_website_9-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Based on the client&#8217;s needs, we prioritize different pages/screens of the platform and craft wireframes for them first. And then based on the information hierarchy of these pages, we proceed with the rest of the website.</p>
<h3>C. Text Placeholders &amp; The Problems They Pose</h3>
<p>Text placeholders, such as Lorem ipsum are an easy enough solution to understand on-screen text placement. But it is not a long-term solution. In fact, using text placeholders causes more problems in terms of content space and wireframe navigation design.</p>
<p>And that’s why we include relevant text during the wireframing process from the start. This practice assists to grasp how much space a specific text will require and design accordingly.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Skip Wireframes: They Are The Blueprints Of Your Design Dreams</h2>
<p>Wireframes are an essential part of the agile web design process. With this, entrepreneurs, designers, and developers can visualize the product together, determine its various aspects as well as make all the changes it needs in the very beginning.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>@Siri: “Let There Be Voice!” Siri: “Ok Sir”</h3>
<p>The silent relationship between the users and the digital world got the added tip of voice when the voice search entered the digital realm. From fringe to foundational technology, the voice era brought in a substantial transformation.</p>
<p>The reluctance towards typing, the convenience of speaking to the phone, and the growing companionship between digital devices and the users &#8211; all brought in the emergence of the voice search.</p>
<p>This popularity of voice search over the growing popularity of the various types of smart speakers &#8211;</p>
<p>Now, considering the importance that website designs hold in the digital market, voice search has made its impression on the designs as well. This article will look into each of the aspects associated with voice search and its recent association with the website designing &#8211;</p>
<h2 id="id_1">1. So What Is Voice User Interface or VUI?</h2>
<p>The prior versions of UX banked on GUI or Graphical User Interface for the visual interfaces. This is being replaced by the Voice User Interface or VUI that acts as a reciprocal interface between the command platform and the user.</p>
<p>This interface is crucial considering that voice is the core element for websites from 2020 on. This will set apart the surfaced voice-enabled websites from the pro ones.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12749" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-user-interface-1024x1024.jpg" alt="voice user interface design" width="653" height="653" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-user-interface-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-user-interface-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-user-interface-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-user-interface-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-user-interface-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-user-interface-2048x2048.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" /></p>
<p>Well-versed with the triggers of UX voice design? Well, that’s only the start. @Designers: now acquaint yourself with the elements that you would need to keep handy while designing a site for the vice search era. Here goes the list &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompt: The reply of the voice assistant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Intent: The task of the user that needs to be completed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Slot: Information that is required for the application to complete the task assigned by the user.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Utterance: The words that the user uses to trigger the task.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="id_2">2. How To Prototype A Voice User Interface Design?</h2>
<p>A successful voice user interface design process mirrors any expert UI procedure. This requires prototyping to avoid occurrences of any flaws in a voice-enabled site. It ensures boosted client traffic and mitigated costs and time involved in developing a site.</p>
<p>The prototyping procedure comprises the following steps &#8211;</p>
<p>Step 1: Listen and transcribe human-to-human conversation that is similar to the perfect interface.</p>
<p>Step 2: Focus on the opportunity offered by the functionality of your interface. Such opportunities should be kept simple initially.</p>
<p>Step 3: Plot on the sample dialogues. Start working on the shortest route to the completion process. This offers a layout that indicates that the user is the one who has offered all the essential information.</p>
<p>Step 4: Structuring the complexities and layers into your conversational logic. This includes writing dialogues for the handling of errors and dialogues. This step is crucial, especially for first-time users.</p>
<p>Step 5: Document the relationship between each script, and the conversation logic, and use a flow chart for all of these activities.</p>
<h2 id="id_3">3. What Are The Triggers For Voice Input?</h2>
<p>Equipping and getting a site that is voice search enabled, is based on a detailed understanding of vocal triggers for input. Such triggers have four categories &#8211;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12741 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/meme-4.png" alt="voice user interface" width="445" height="249" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/meme-4.png 445w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/meme-4-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /></p>
<h4>a: Voice trigger</h4>
<p>User voices out his/her command starting with the phrase &#8211; Ok Google, Hello Alexa, Hey Siri, Hello Cortana. This starts with the processing of the speech.</p>
<h4>b: Device self-trigger</h4>
<p>Sometimes pre-determined settings on the device trigger the voice commencement.</p>
<h4>c: Motion Trigger</h4>
<p>A mere movement of the hand in front of the sensor of a device triggers the voice commencement.</p>
<h4>d: Tactile trigger</h4>
<p>The user presses a button or toggles an icon to start with the voice commands.</p>
<h2 id="id_4">4. But What Is The Voice-Based Design Process? How To Get Started?</h2>
<p>By now, both designers and developers have a ‘Step 1’ idea about the voice-enabled sites. Then again we are already experiencing user satisfaction with smart voice assistants, then why are we so eager to make more out of voice? It is all about raising the bar for the quality of interaction between the machines and the users.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12750 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-recognition-1024x715.jpg" alt="voice user interface design process" width="1024" height="715" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-recognition-1024x715.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-recognition-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-recognition-768x536.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-recognition-1536x1072.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-recognition-2048x1430.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>This brings designers to the task of revamping their site as per voice-based experience. Unlike popular belief, designing VUI is not much different from designing GUI. in this regard, one needs to remember that designing or revamping for voice search is the next natural step in website designing and it isn’t a new direction. Going the guidelines from the experts in the field here is the complete blueprint to the voice-based design process &#8211;</p>
<h3>Step 1: Research</h3>
<p>Needless to say, the primary focus of voice-enabled websites, like any other digital product is to fathom out the target user-behavior. This builds the foundation for all the product requirements. In this case, website designers need to peek into the user psychology, focus on their pain points, and concentrate on the user language.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Define</h3>
<p>This step comprises shaping the product and defining the capabilities of the same. Then again, this includes two parts &#8211;</p>
<p>a. Defining Key Interaction Scenarios &#8211; Designing scenarios that are of high value for the targeted clientele is of prior importance. You can also use a matrix that will help to evaluate individual scenarios and hence compartmentalize which of the options are primary, or secondary, or merely nice to have.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12742 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-interaction-use-case.png" alt="voice user interface use cases" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-interaction-use-case.png 800w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-interaction-use-case-300x169.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-interaction-use-case-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>b. Ensuring That The Aforementioned Scenarios Function With Voice &#8211; While using voice is a trending element in website designing, there should be some compelling reasons to utilize voice. The inclusion of voice into sites must necessarily ensure easier and quicker solutions to problems in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p>Designers would need to identify specific and common cases wherein the users will definitely draw leverage. The voice interaction limitations will also need to be considered.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Create</h3>
<p>With voice search, just like any other designing trend, the key is to make a flawless prototype. In this case, the prototype starts with drawing boards. The very first step is voice user experience flows. From this, user interactions will be mapped. There are two parts to this &#8211; creating and error handling.</p>
<p>In creating, the focus needs to be the usage of storyboards to sketch the idea and creation of dialogues.</p>
<h4>a: Storyboards</h4>
<p>These are used to visualize the flow and interaction in context. This lends a realistic feeling for the designers and the users alike.</p>
<h4>b: Writing Dialogues</h4>
<p>With voice user flow, the primary hit is dialogues. With each scenario that is well supported by voice apps, there is a commencement of conversational dialogues between the apps and its users. Since human conversations are often layered, each of the twists should be taken into consideration while writing dialogues and thinking through the scenarios. It would be best if the designers can &#8211;</p>
<p>1. Not teach ‘command’</p>
<p>2. Be precise with the response and question</p>
<p>3. Mitigate the number of steps required to complete the designated task.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Error Handling</h3>
<p>Not to discourage you, but developers and designers would know that irrespective of the preparation that you take to make a flawless VUI, there are diverse elements that are sure to go wrong. Designing for these pitfalls is the challenge. The best measures to meet these are as follows &#8211;</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Leveraging context to create a better user experience with customization.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Baking empathy in interactions and ensuring that responses are slightly tweaked each time so as to avoid the feeling that the interactions are machine-like.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong> Reflecting the brand’s unique identity over the VUI personas via the wording of your structured dialogues.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4:</strong> Confirmation upon completion of tasks to ensure that the user is assured about the recording of his/her transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 5:</strong> Covering alternate phrases to ensure that your site grabs the heights of SERP despite a complex process to map the vocalization of the VUI.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 6:</strong> Prototyping apps/sites that would include the creation of voice triggers and speech playbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 7:</strong> Testing dialogues to ensure that the conversational and informal tonality is sustained in it. It is advised to role-play conversations and record and play audio with the dialogues.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Test</h3>
<p>With the designing process, testing is a crucial step to determine if the site/app befits the targeted user or not. The testing procedure needs to be accrued out for two gateways &#8211;</p>
<h4>a: With Target Users</h4>
<p>Usability testing sessions over selected representatives from the target audience, and observation about how the users interact with the site and the app. Keep a track of the Customer Satisfaction Score and the rate of task completion.</p>
<h4>b: Test Stimulators</h4>
<p>You can have testing tools from reputed brands to test the Action or Skill in the simulation of your hardware devices and their settings. This offers a great voice experience feel in the real world.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Refine</h3>
<p>Designers and developers need to refine their voice-enabled sites and applications prior to sending them to the market. For this, designers would need to collect the analytics by tracking some key metrics that include &#8211; behavior flows, utterance and intent, and metrics for user engagement.</p>
<p>The specialty with the aforementioned steps is that such a procedure can be applied to diverse voice interface types. These types include &#8211; voice-only, voice-first, and voice-enabled interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="id_5">5. Okay Google, What Are The Rules Of Implementing Voice Search Into UX?</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, designing VUI is not much different from designing a GUI. All that website designers need to do is follow up on a few rules to revamp as per the voice search requirements. Here are some of such highlighted designing rules &#8211;</p>
<h3>A: Designing A Natural Way Of Interaction</h3>
<p>Think of this &#8211; prior to voice search, you would type in “What is the best web design company in Casablanca?” and get some mechanized responses.</p>
<p>However, now, with “Okay Google/ Hey Alexa/ Hi Siri/ Hello Cortana What is the best web design company in Casablanca?”, you get human-like responses. That is the primary goal of voice search.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12743 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/query-567x1024.jpg" alt="trigger words for Voice UI" width="567" height="1024" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/query-567x1024.jpg 567w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/query-166x300.jpg 166w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/query.jpg 638w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" /></p>
<p>With any voice-enabled product (app or website), the target is the same &#8211; effective and natural interaction between users and the product.</p>
<p>Such approaches pace up the interaction process considering that it enables users to interact with the system on their own terms. Additionally, the expectation of the users to have human-like conversations is also met. This indicates that designers, prior to designing voice-enabled sites must necessarily fathom out the basics of human interaction like &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Longer query phrases</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Use of ‘wh’ words in the key phrases of search</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Natural query language</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Preference for queries instead of statements</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Localized SEO</li>
</ol>
<h3>B: Voice User Interface Design For Flow</h3>
<p>With a majority of the voice-enabled interface equipped products, the primary step is to opt for voice input. This step is followed by the user requiring to shift to the style of touch interaction. However, the latter can often lead to fragmented user experience. Thus, designers need to know the crucial role that voice carries out in the latest overall search strategy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12744 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/semantics-search-probability.jpg" alt="Voice UI for design flow" width="512" height="323" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/semantics-search-probability.jpg 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/semantics-search-probability-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>In this approach, it is essential that designers know &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Who are the targeted clientele and their expectations from their VUI</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The main deeds of the VUI</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">How sure are you that your user would primarily rely on the VUI as a mode of search?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Plot a journey mapping</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Spot the critical user scenario</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Look for where the voice modality fits itself into</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Create a user matrix to draw the benefit from the usage of voice, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3>C: Designing After Researching The Flow</h3>
<p>Harness the limitation and the capability of your voice-enabled designed platform. Spotting this platform ensures fathoming out the role of voice in interactions between the user and the platform. For this rule, it is essential that designers know that they are designing majorly for two voice search-enabled devices</p>
<p><strong>a. Voice-First Device:</strong> Reliance on voice search as a primary mode of interaction that includes smart speakers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12745 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-first-device-1024x576.jpg" alt="voice first device" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-first-device-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-first-device-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-first-device-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-first-device.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><strong>b. Screen-First Device:</strong> Usage of graphical UI as primary interfaces, where voice is only a supportive and additional interface. Mobile phones, televisions are examples of such devices.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12746 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screen-first-device.jpg" alt="voice user interface" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screen-first-device.jpg 600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screen-first-device-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>D: Designing After Using A Sequential Number For Search Results</h3>
<p>With voice search, users look for convenience. They often look into single search results. However, assigning numbers is essential when the search result is more than one. These number handles are useful while selecting items when the user says “Siri select number 3.”</p>
<h3>E: Designing With Displays Of The Suggested Search Queries</h3>
<p>Suggestive search inquiries over a voice-enabled system are</p>
<p>a new mechanism that on one hand proves to be useful to the visitor, on the other hand, and tempts the user to make a choice. This system that uses contextual suggestions raises awareness among first-time users and lures them for better engagement with the voice-search device.</p>
<h3>F: Designing Targeted At Mitigating Typing Functions</h3>
<p>Voice-enabled devices are all about the leverage of hands-free interaction. This scope at a frictionless inquiry is leverage and ensures that the user need not take traditional steps to convert. Such endeavors alter the role of a screen completely in devices &#8211; from an input to an output modality. This considerably reduces the user’s burden of device memory.</p>
<h3>G: Designing While Preparing For Error Handling And Prevention</h3>
<p>While users are used to speaking in shortcuts while interacting with each other, this causes substantial confusion for the voice-search enabled devices. On the flip side, even with complete phrases, there are troubles for the devices.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12747 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/meme-2.jpg" alt="Voice UI meme" width="500" height="683" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/meme-2.jpg 500w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/meme-2-220x300.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Despite how well the system has been uploaded with information, there are always chances of risks and failures associated.</p>
<p>For error recovery, one of the best modes is to mitigate dead ends via utilization of analytics to fathom out the user journey junctures where the hurdles exist.</p>
<h3>H: Designing With An In-Depth Understanding Of The Context</h3>
<p>Localized SEO is everything for voice searches. This is because individuals when looking for businesses or entertainments in their locality, often bank on VUI. However, with this equipment, the Voice UI needs to take into account the time and location of the day while answering the queries of the users.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12748 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-UI.png" alt="voice user interface" width="512" height="261" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-UI.png 512w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/voice-UI-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<h2>Start Listening to Voice User Interface!”</h2>
<p><i>“Ahoy friends!&#8221; &#8211; </i>True that your Alexa possibly doesn’t yet respond to this, but the level of interaction and the touch of human-like emotions is gaining pace. Know this &#8211; voice is here to stay for a long time! You cannot trust your audience to waste time twiddling their thumbs any longer. They will be voicing out their opinions, and your Sire would need to pay close attention. You are looking at a future that is AI- blessed and will strive to offer nothing short of classy, customized solutions to each of your issues. In that way, we are not far away from Tony Stark’s Jarvis!</p>
<p>Remember this quote from Julius Caesar &#8211; “<i>Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.”? </i>Make sure that you and your brand are not in the bracket of “<i>ourselves”</i>. Hop on to the voice train and enjoy the journey with Alexa, Google, Cortana, and Siri!</p>
<p><i>“Hey, Alexa, how do you think readers would rate this read?”</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The online alcohol market place is in a spirited away situation right now. Wondering why?</p>
<p>Because despite having the potential of exponential growth, it is still not off the ground yet. And yes even I am having a hard time believing it. We are living in the greatest era of online shopping portals and applications where we can order our favorite food, books, even furniture online. But have a hard time finding a decent bottle of Chardonnay.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what gives? Why are famous wine and alcohol breweries still not taking advantage of this booming eCommerce scenario? What’s stopping them? And what will happen when they do enter the eCommerce sector with full force?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12644 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maksym-kaharlytskyi-3uJt73tr4hI-unsplash-1024x682.jpg" alt="wine ecommerce" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maksym-kaharlytskyi-3uJt73tr4hI-unsplash-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maksym-kaharlytskyi-3uJt73tr4hI-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maksym-kaharlytskyi-3uJt73tr4hI-unsplash-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maksym-kaharlytskyi-3uJt73tr4hI-unsplash-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maksym-kaharlytskyi-3uJt73tr4hI-unsplash.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, I can’t see the future. But I can look at the present and tell you that right now is the perfect time to open an online marketplace for liquor. And if you are thinking about how to do it, then rest assured, because I’m going to talk about that too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So let’s begin, shall we?</p>
<h2 id="id_1" style="text-align: left;">1. Why Wine, Should be online</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why is alcohol eCommerce still a unique idea?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, it is a valid question, after all, eCommerce is not exactly anything unique at this point. However, the key factor that is making it unique is the fact that the market is still untapped.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Besides a handful of websites and online grocery store channels, the market is mostly empty. Which is unusual, because people love buying things online as much as they love to enjoy a good glass of wine.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s look at a few stats if you are still skeptical about the success of an alcohol delivery app.</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The total sales of alcoholic beverages in the US alone were noted to be about<a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1709/alcoholic-beverages/#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20few%20years,dollars%20in%20sales%20in%202015."> $243.6 billion in 2018</a>.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Alcohol sales through online grocery and marketplace<a href="https://research.rabobank.com/far/en/sectors/beverages/the-2020-alcohol-e-commerce-playbook.html"> grew by 115% and 60% in 2019</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 scenario, and stay at home measures have increased the demand for online eCommerce market for, well, everything, including alcohol.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, if these statistics are not convincing enough, let’s look at a few advantages.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Opening Up To A Larger Audience</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Everyone is online, and you should be too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Really. People are more prone to shop and discover newer products online than they are in the real world. And with a marketplace distribution platform for liquor, your winery/distillery/brewery can become part of the online world, opening up the business to a broader audience and increasing chances of business success. &#8216;</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Pro Tip: It is absolutely crucial to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience on an alcohol eCommerce platform. These needs and preferences can change depending on what generation the users belong to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Needless to say that with a website, one can reach out to a larger audience through meaningful content, increasing the market value of the business.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P.S.: In case you are wondering about the success rate, well, what can we say, just consult the </span><a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/shopify/new-york/new-york-city"><b>Top Casablanca Shopify Development Agencies</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! Their expertise plus the statistics to support their statement will convince you enough!</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Increasing Online Visibility</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In today’s world, online visibility is everything. If something doesn&#8217;t exist online, it might not exist at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While it might be nice to be the exclusive winery that makes wines from super rare grapes, it won’t get you far. Exclusivity comes from quality and renown. For new businesses, it is crucial to earning that “renown” part. An online platform will be the key to enhancing online visibility as well as The perfect decision to build a good reputation in the market.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. Data Collection And Analyzation For Better Business</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Needless to say, data is everything today. No matter what market you are in, data will help you to excel, and the same goes for the online marketplace for liquor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12646 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/business-models-1024x768.jpg" alt="wine ecommerce" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/business-models-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/business-models-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/business-models-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/business-models-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/business-models-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With an online eCommerce platform, business owners will be able to collect a substantial amount of data that will provide a unique perspective on the client demographic. This insight can help to enhance the workings of the eCommerce platform, and eventually increase sales.</p>
<h2 id="id_2" style="text-align: left;">2. Business Models For Wine Ecommerce</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Choosing the right business model is going to be crucial for the success of the wine eCommerce platform. It will not only define the way you are going to conduct businesses but also how the website development and design process can go. Here are the two most common alcohol marketplace business models.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Business To Customer</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">B2C is the most common model for eCommerce marketplace management. With this model, the store (retail seller, chain store with online platform) will establish a direct relationship with the customer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the main benefits of this model is the fact that manufacturers, i.e. the beverage making companies can leverage the advantage of the huge client base of the retailer stores.</p>
<div class="related-post-box" style="text-align: left;">
<div class="related-post-box-item">
<p class="title">Pro Tip: Many countries may not allow a brewery/winery to sell directly to their customers. In that case, they will have to go through a third party distributor to reach out to the customer. So conduct thorough research on the alcohol eCommerce Law and regulation before making any plans.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">The downside, however, is the fact that the manufacturer won’t have any direct control over targeting a specific type of customer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. The Wine Club Model</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The wine club model is a popular business model for the wine eCommerce platform. It focuses on providing an annual service to the customers based on their subscriptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Depending on the tier of subscription, the customers get a select number of wines delivered to them on an annual basis. The wine industry has been leveraging the advantage of this model for a decade and so far it is one of the most successful business models. So much that other industries such as fashion and beauty have started to leverage it as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The best thing about this model is that businesses have more control over predicting and stocking their stock, while the customer gets more personalized service from the businesses</p>
<h2 id="id_3" style="text-align: left;">3. Different Ways Of Delivering The Beverages</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wine eCommerce platform does not depend on only home delivery. There are two distinct models alcohol eCommerce industry uses, and these are-</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Click It And Collect</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">With this model, the customer places the order through the alcohol delivery app and collects it from any local shop. It is perfect for small retailers who don’t have enough resources for home deliveries. This is also beneficial because with click to collect models, the platform does not have to spend a lot on home delivery expenses.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Delivering The Beverages Directly</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Direct delivery or home delivery is a well-known delivery model for eCommerce distribution networks. The marketplace platform can deliver the beverages straight to the user’s home through their own delivery services, or hire the assistance of other delivery and courier services like FedEx or UPS.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Choosing a delivery model is tricky as it can impact the development of the platform. So make sure to talk to the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-development-company/">web development agency</a> you partner with before making any decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now let’s talk about how you can actually build such a platform. For the sake of convenience, we will divide this part into two segments- design and development. So let’s begin.</p>
<h2 id="id_4" style="text-align: left;">4. Let’s Get Into The Development Process</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Developing a wine eCommerce platform is a pretty unique idea, considering the market and how hard it can be to please the connoisseurs of fine wines. But, with good planning and a great work ethic, it can be done. Below we are going to talk about the development process of an alcohol delivery app/website based on our process. If you want to learn more then check out <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/how-we-work/">our work process page</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Planning What It Takes To Build A Beverage eCommerce Website</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Planning is considered to be the most important because this is where it all begins. Every decision taken in this step will act as a foundation for the development of the entire platform and a shaky foundation never did any good.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, for example, you are looking at Magento and marveling at its strategic approach and quick success. You find yourself wondering what could be its secret &#8211; we say, look closer, ask any of the </span><a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/magento/new-york/new-york-city"><b>Top Casablanca Magento Development Agencies</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and they will tell you &#8211; it’s all in the planning!  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, now that you know how crucial the planning process is, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here is a brief rundown of the planning process, and how we can use it to decipher the code to wine eCommerce success-</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Determining the business goals and objectives:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The process starts with a discussion about the business and its goals. This discussion includes the country, city, or continent the platform for selling alcohol online will be operating within, the kind of products they will be selling, and what kind of revenue they are looking to make initially.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Understanding the competitive landscape:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the step where market and competitor investigation is conducted and that information is used to refine the later stages of the development process. Competitor research will provide information on how other online alcohol stores are operating, the design and development details of those platforms. And market research will give information on the audience, and their demands for such a platform.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Understanding the target audience:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next step is to research the target audience. For a platform such as b2b wine delivery, this step is important. It will help in understanding the users and what they really need from a wine eCommerce platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The insight gathered during the planning process is going to be invaluable during the next stage, which is the design stage.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Creating An “Intoxicating” Design</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Design for us is a user-focused process, and that’s why our design process starts with user persona creations and empathy mapping.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important to focus on and understand the user when designing an alcohol delivery website. The user base for such a platform is diverse and vast, including users from all walks of life, and not creating a user persona before beginning the design, is not going to be an efficient way of beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When designing for alcohol delivery services, we aim to follow the market standards in the industry, set by competitors and <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/web-design-new-york/">web design agency based on major cities like Casablanca</a>. But that does not mean there are no unique twists. Mixing up a little twist in the basic rules can be a good practice when it comes to web design. For now, let’s check out the market standards for web design in the eCommerce segment-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Keep It Light And Breezy</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you follow most of the competitors in the b2b alcohol marketplace, you will notice that they are keeping up with the light and breezy design trends. Why?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12653 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Light-and-breezy.jpg" alt="Light and breezy" width="562" height="390" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Light-and-breezy.jpg 562w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Light-and-breezy-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because it keeps the users focused on the products. With extra graphics, animations, and effects, you will only distract them. So it is better to keep the design light and their focus heavy on the product.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Lean Towards Legible Typography</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s face it, some of those wines have names that are really hard to pronounce. And displaying those tough to pronounce names in cursive lettering will not help online alcohol sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12654 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/typography.jpg" alt="typography" width="878" height="519" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/typography.jpg 878w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/typography-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/typography-768x454.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Using too complicated typography will make web approachability a major issue. So it will be</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">wise for you to use legible font and typography on the site so that users can engage better.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Efficiency In Design Is Key To Success</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’m sure users would love some transition effects as well as some micro-interactions. But adding too much can be a little harmful especially for the b2b website for wine.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When browsing an eCommerce site, regardless of the market, customers look for efficiency in the experience. The ease and speed of the whole process matter more than extra embellishments of the design. Not to mention all those extra bells and whistles are going to blow a hole in the budget as well. So the best idea is to keep it simple, efficient, with just the right amount of spice.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12655 size-large" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/08-MARKETPLACE-SELECTION-1024x576.jpg" alt="marketplace selection" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/08-MARKETPLACE-SELECTION-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/08-MARKETPLACE-SELECTION-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/08-MARKETPLACE-SELECTION-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/08-MARKETPLACE-SELECTION.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once the UI design and clickable prototype are approved by the client it is time to move onto the development process. This is the process where the design is turned into a functional product ready to take over the market.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. Brewing The Perfect Platform</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once the strategy Agile Scrum Methodology for the development is ready, we try to choose the best possible tech stack that benefits the platform as well as help with the development to be done in as little time as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The main aim of the development process is to deliver a viable product that not only sells but also brings some real benefits to the business. With an expert team and an array of latest tech at our disposal, we make sure that the alcohol marketplace platform is developed to function at its fullest. Here is a list of tech stack we use to make the platform function properly.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. Testing The Waters Before Going Live</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last but not least, testing is as important a step as any other in the whole development process for us. No product is launched without testing it and making sure that it is free of all issues and bugs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Various tests are performed to ensure the quality of the product. Here are the top three tests performed we perform on the developed product in order to ensure its quality and security-</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Catching The Bugs With Unit Testing</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Through unit testing, we test each singular part of the product, a.k.a units separately to ensure that they are functioning properly. During this, the developers are also going to look for bugs, and work to remove them during the development process.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Looking Under The Stones With Manual Testing</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Manual testing is done by testers to check out the problems that can be skipped over sometimes. This is a test done by humans for human users and it is the best possible way to make sure that the wine eCommerce is working perfectly and the UX offers value to the users on the platform.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Guarding Against Adversaries With Security Testings</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The aim of security testing is to locate the vulnerabilities within the codes and fix them before the product goes live. It’s crucial that for an eCommerce website security testing is done properly, as it will be handling a lot of sensitive online alcohol sales data as well as users’ payment data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important to check out the challenges an alcohol eCommerce platform can face before making big plans. So let’s check out the major challenges in both the US market and the UK market for a better idea of what is to come.</p>
<h2 id="id_5" style="text-align: left;">5. Challenges and Legal Advice: How Hard Can They Be?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">For wine eCommerce, regulatory and legal challenges are many. Let’s check out the major challenges in two of the biggest markets for online alcohol selling, the US and the UK market</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The US Market Challenges</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The legal challenges for the US market are many. From the three-tier model that limits the breweries from selling online to temperature control, there are many legal and technical challenges to overcome if you want to sell wine online in the US market. Let’s check out the top challenges for the US market.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. The Three-Tier Business Model</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The popular three-tier distribution system was launched in America during the 21st amendment of the US constitution. According to this, wine manufacturers can not directly sell to retailers or customers. They have to go through an alcoholic beverage wholesaler to reach out to the customer. This also means that alcohol brands, wineries, and breweries can not sell alcoholic beverages online.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There have been some international and national alcohol businesses that voiced their concerns about this system and how this makes it harder for international brands to enter the US market. However, the law was placed in order to prevent alcohol abuse. So make sure before creating such a platform you become familiar with the finer points of this law.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Shipping Restrictions And Regulations</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are hundreds of shipping regulations and laws one needs to know before opening a wine eCommerce Marketplace.  In the US, individual states have control over the production, distribution, import/export, and sale of alcoholic beverages. Every state has a different set of laws, which means that to run an alcohol eCommerce platform in the US, one has to navigate all these regulatory laws. There are also some state laws that prevent the sale and importation of certain kinds and quantity of alcohol the users can order.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">c. Age Restriction For Alcohol Consumption</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are age restrictions on the consumption of alcohol around the world. For the US that age is 21 years. And this age restriction applies to selling alcoholic beverages online as well. And that’s why you need to take steps to ensure that the selling process is not violating this law in any way.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For any kind of alcohol delivery process, an adult needs to be present to sign the documents. For those who are choosing for a click to collect model, where the users are ordering online and picking them up from a local store, they have to procure an ID before paying and collecting. The age gating process can be a little complicated to integrate when creating a wine e-store, but with the help of AI-based ID verification systems, this can be solved well.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">d. Temperature Control During Delivery</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the home delivery of alcoholic beverages, it is necessary to keep track of the temperature of the drinks being delivered. This is a necessary part of keeping up with the freshness factor of the beverages. And that’s why it is important for the alcohol marketplace platforms to maintain a framework for temperature control. So many eCommerce platforms postpone the delivery in case the temperature is not between 45°F and 80°F.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">For the UK Market</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The legal regulations for the UK market are somewhat more relaxed than the US market. However, there are two important things to overcome if you want to sell alcohol online in the UK.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">a. Acquiring The Proper Licenses</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">For selling alcohol online you will need two licenses: personal license and premise license.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A personal license gives the person permission to manage and sell alcohol to the customers. A premise license legalizes the place or distribution house from where alcohol is distributed. And in order to sell alcohol online, one would need both types of licenses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For personal licenses, the business owner will have to take a short training course. Once you have a personal license, you can apply for a premise license.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">b. Ensuring The Safety Of Under-Age Citizens</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Probably the most important legal issue one has to pay attention to when applying for a premise license is the “protection of minors from alcohol abuse” issue. The legal age for drinking in the UK is 18. And anyone under that age needs to be protected from under-age drinking issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The risk assessment and plans to protect the underage from alcohol abuse are going to be crucial. If the authorities are not convinced, they will not grant you a license for alcohol marketplace distribution services.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Wrapping Up: Are You Taking Your Wine Business Online Then?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what’s the end word on the alcohol marketplace platform development?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The truth is, it is an incredibly beneficial market. The online marketplace for liquor is growing and it is expected to grow more in the coming year. Add that to the popularity of online shopping among the modern consumer base, and you have a sure shot at success.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, the legal hurdles are many, and it is not often easy to weave through them without having to lose one or two business aspects. But with reliable web development and design partner and legal help, you can figure out quite easily how to sell alcohol online, and thrive in the market.</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/11/e15195"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted among the nurses of the Nursing Association of Barcelona revealed that about 48.35% of the respondents had healthcare apps installed on their smartphones. Along with that, 80% of revealed that these apps should be certified by health and professional institutes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accenture’s </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">study on Medical apps shows</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 78% of all consumers are interested in receiving virtual healthcare services. However, right now only 21% of them have received services that way. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your healthcare application development can only succeed if it solves a problem and right now there are many problems with the healthcare industry in the world. To validate your idea, make sure that your app solves at least one of these following problems &#8211; </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Managing paperwork</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are still many clinics and hospitals that maintain records on paper. Managing this paperwork takes a lot of time, as it shows in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">study about how nurses use their working hours</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the study, nurses spend about 35.3% time in documentation. Which is a lot of time to spend on documentation. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Data management in healthcare mobile app development</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing data in a disparate system is one of the many problems that plague the healthcare industry. The absence of a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">centralized system prevents doctors from providing proper medical care on time. It also prevents pharmaceutical workers from maintaining accurate records for medicine manufacturing and delivery</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Disconnected tech</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference in the formulary, connectivity, communicatory and security protocols between various healthcare organizations creates an impossible to manage the environment. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Variation in process</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disconnected tech creates the problem of variation in the process between different organizations. The serious lack of integration forces the staff to create and adhere to their own process, creating a serious variation in the process and preventing the unification of the healthcare industry.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you are sure of your idea, you can move onto the next step of development- choosing the app type.</span></p>
<h2 id="Choosing_the_right_app_type"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Choose The Right Healthcare Application Type</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are various problems related to the medical industry. As a result, there are different types of medical apps. And before starting with development, you have to choose the type of app you want to build. Here is a list of all types of professional medical apps in the market right now. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12057 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/heathcare-app-types.jpg" alt="types of healthcare apps" width="825" height="692" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/heathcare-app-types.jpg 825w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/heathcare-app-types-300x252.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/heathcare-app-types-768x644.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that the kind of application you choose will have an impact on the kind of features you’ll need to integrate into the app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Networking Apps For Healthcare Professionals</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Networking apps for healthcare professionals work just like any other professional apps. These apps create a streamlined experience for doctors and nurses alike to connect with other professionals in the same field, interact with them and share news relevant to the healthcare industry easily. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Medical database apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical database apps help professionals to store and access data easily. The types of data that can be stored and accessed through a medical database app may include &#8211;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patient’s details (illness, what treatment they are receiving, who is treating them what medicine they are being given)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicine inventory details</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctor and nurse’s contact information</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The database application helps the professionals access the right data at the right time, and edit it when required. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Clinical Assistance Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With clinical assistance applications, doctors can easily view laboratory results, the patient’s vital charts, symptoms and has access to all-round assistance all the time. These hospital management mobile apps continuously help the doctors to diagnose and treat the patients with accuracy. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Patient Health Tracking Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The patient health tracking apps help the doctors to keep track of a patient’s health even after they have left the hospital. These apps keep track of the patient’s vitals and help alert the doctors if the vitals drop below or go above the average. Perfect for patients of fluctuating blood pressure, diabetes, and many others, these apps can be a lifesaver if developed perfectly. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Doctor-on-demand apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients don’t always have time to visit a doctor’s office and that’s where doctor-on-demand apps come in. Working as a virtual chamber, these apps help the patients and doctors to connect through video and audio calls, providing the patients with instant advice on how to deal with the health problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After choosing the type of application, you have to choose the features. Remember that the feature list will vary for different types of healthcare mobile app development. Here we are going to discuss some <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/make-health-fitness-workout-tracker-app/">basic features required to create functional mobile medical apps</a> for healthcare professionals. You can talk to your app development partner about app-specific features. </span></p>
<h2 id="Finalize_the_different_sides_of_your_application"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Different Sides of The Healthcare/Medical App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every app has at least two sides of it, the admin panel, and the user app. The same applies to your healthcare application. To make a functional medicine health application you have to develop an admin panel and a user app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. The Admin Panel</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The admin panel is like the brain of the application. Admin panel is used to manage every aspect of the application, from managing the list of doctors to the appointments booked on the application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the admin panel, you won’t be able to completely manage the functionalities of the application. It is the web-based application that’ll help the authorized personnel to have control over the app and its functionalities. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. The User App</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user application is the business end of the application. This is the part that will be used by healthcare professionals. During development, make sure that the app includes necessary features for the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is incredibly important for the user app to be well designed and developed. It is the business end and it has to impress the users, help them perform the tasks smoothly and provide value to them. </span></p>
<h2 id="Designing_a_medical_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Designing a Medical App: The Things to Consider</span></h2>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. The Principle Of Simplicity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is designed mainly for the treatment of patients, medical applications need to have a simple, intuitive design. A healthcare application does not need any extra flashy design elements, added embellishments and effects. During the design process make sure there are no excess elements to the app. Create a straightforward design that helps the users to make the best of it. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. The Principle Of Sensible Colors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is best to choose sensible colors when designing a healthcare app. Most successful medical applications use sober colors in their designs. You should also consider the age group of the target audience. Choosing the right color palette helps you a lot in user retention. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. The Principle Of Readability</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhancing readability should be important for your medical app&#8217;s design. Using fancy fonts looks good, but makes the app hard to use. So choose an easy-to-read font style, and don’t use more than two styles in the app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. The Principle Of Responsive Design</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsive design for mobile applications is a given these days, thanks to the wide range of devices being used by industry professionals these days. So make sure that the app is designed to fit any screen the user might be using. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To launch a medical application for the USA market that transmits Protected Health Information (PHI) of a patient must be in compliance with the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This act regulated how protected health information is sent back and forth between the servers and forces limitations on the access to individually identifiable healthcare information to the unauthorized personnel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your application will fall under <a href="https://www.jotform.com/what-is-hipaa-compliance/">HIPAA compliance</a> if it contains PHI and it is shared by the covered organizations like hospitals. Any healthcare apps that don&#8217;t contain PHI falls under the Non-HIPAA category. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada sets out the parameters for the use of personal data through the </span><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8.6/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The act sets out privacy rules for the use of personal information for businesses, including medical apps. The Canadian government uses this act to regulate the use of personal data by businesses.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Union</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking to launch your medical app in Europe, you have to make sure that your app complies with the </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Data Protection Regulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in effect since 2018 May. GDPR specifies how businesses can treat personal data and how they should protect it. The regulation applies to all EU citizens. Collecting and using medical data of the EU citizens makes the application subject of GDPR regulation. Under GDPR any data identifying username, password, photos, health records, etc are considered as personal data. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK you have to follow the Data Protection Act for patient care apps. It regulates and sets out the limits on the usage and storage of personal information. According to the law, the uses should be detailed in the privacy policy.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asian regions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data privacy laws vary greatly all over the Asia Pacific region. And to launch your mobile applications for the health sector you have to become familiar with them. The data protection laws change over time in this region. It seems to take a similar shape to the General Data Protection Regulation in use in the EU. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of all the variations, two laws stand out. Japan’s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), dating back to 2003, acts as the oldest law in this field. Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) is extremely strict. It has some of the toughest penalties for those who misuse personal information of the users. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know some really cliche lines like</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The home is where the heart is”, or “home sweet home”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However cliche these lines may seem like, home is the closest place we have to heart. After all, it is THE place we can come back to after a long day and just take a nap!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying a house is not an easy process. You have to go through various property listings, talk to agents, sort through paperwork and complete many other duties. This complication of process calls for a simple solution, and that solution is real estate apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you think that as a startup you can provide that solution, then this article is for you. If you want to create your own real estate app like Zillow but don’t know how then this article is going to give you all the details you need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From idea validation to all the steps that it takes to build such an app (no pun intended!) and then some unique integrations, we are going to discuss it all.  So without any delay, let’s look at the steps you need to follow first. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a Real Estate App like Zillow &#8211; Brick by Brick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like a difficult thing to do, but building a real estate app is extremely easy, especially if you follow these steps…</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s create a real estate app now!</span></p>
<h2 id="Validate_your_real_estate_app_idea"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1st Brick: Idea Validation: Why You Should Create Your Own Real Estate App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about the validity of the idea before talking about realtor app builder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first glance, the idea of such an app seems a little ridiculous. Because buying and selling houses is something that has been done without any apps or software for decades. So why suddenly use an app now?</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11399" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11399 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map.png" alt="average rent prices" width="900" height="639" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map.png 900w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map-300x213.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Monthly-Report_april_2019_large-cities-map-768x545.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11399" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Rentcafe</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look into the image above, the high rates of rents are proof of why people are looking to but their own homes rather than giving rents. With real estate apps like Zillow and Trulia in Casablanca and California, the real estate industry is one step closer to digitization, helping to make the complicated process of home buying easier. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Better for mobility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it going to be easier for users to use their smartphones for property browsing? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes. They are using their phones for every other task anyways. If you <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/">make the right app</a>, users can look for property on the go with these apps. There’s no need to visit every prospective house and location they see fit. They can check out the details of the house or the apartment from the app and visit if it matches their requirements. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Location centric</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a geolocation feature on every smartphone and that m2akes it easy to make location-centric searches. So it’s not surprising when the users can make location-centric searches and find the places nearby without any hassle. Zillow real estate app makes it easy. Take a note here.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Instant notification</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an instant age and people like things instantly. They don’t want to wait for weeks to get details on a property, they want those details instantly, or at least want to know instantly when the details are becoming available. And that’s how real estate apps are becoming crucial for the users on their path to find the perfect home. </span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s see how real estate mobile app development is helping the industry professionals-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Providing Better Customer Support</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real estate business is a complicated one, but if you create your own real estate app, you can ease the pain. The clients need proper customer support to actually get through this. And an app is going to be the perfect tool for that. The features such as constant and direct connection with the clients are going to make it easy to build a healthy relationship with the clients. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. The Direct Marketing Facility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate apps are the best instrument for directly marketing your business to the clients. There is no interruption of a third party or spam. Not only it will bring in more clients and therefore more business and revenues, but it will also keep the clients engaged with your business.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">F. Stand Out Among The Competition </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an app, you will get a better understanding of your clients as well as stay updated with the popular market trends. Not to mention, with a specialized app for buying and selling property, you will be able to stand out in the market and get more clients easily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have validated the idea of real estate app development, we need to talk about the two distinct types of app you can build. </span></p>
<h2 id="Know_the_app_types"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2nd Brick: Know The App, Know The Types</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you hire any freelancer or real estate app development company, you need to understand the app types. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to mobile app development for real estate, there can be two types of apps depending on how they function. The first one is an agency based app, and the second one is a third party app. How these apps function? Let’s see-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. The Agency App</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency app, just like its name, belongs to the specific real estate agencies. Working as the digital face of the business, the agency app lists all the houses under their listing, has all their agents listed for easy access of the users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the agency app, the agency can keep track of their business improvements, how many clients are engaging with their agency, and what their demands are. It is basically an improved tool for business management and improvement. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. The Third-Party Model</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third party or the aggregator model works as the mediator between the buyers and the agents. The workings of the third party model is a little different than the agency app.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can sign up either as buyers/sellers or freelancer agents. The freelancing agents can upload their own listings and expand their network through the app.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user, on the other hand, can contact the agents nearby, browse through their listings, look for houses they are interested in. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sellers can sign up and contact the agents about the property they want to sell. The third-party app basically becomes a platform for the agents and the buyers/sellers to easily and instantly communicate. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have decided on the app model, the next step is going to be planning the right real estate mobile app features. </span></p>
<h2 id="Plan_out_the_app_features"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3rd Brick: Planning the Futuristic features</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like manners maketh man, the features maketh an app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why you have to be careful about picking the right features for your app. The right real estate mobile app features can help your app become more functional and useful for the users. You can also go for a whiteboarding session with <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/">a reliable mobile app development company based out in Casablanca</a> to get the feel of the market. So what kind of features does your real estate app need? Here is a list-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Login/Signup</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By signing up the users can create a personal account where they can save various information and preferences, search histories, etc. There are a few ways this feature can be implemented-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can sign up using their mail ID or phone number. It is also important that you implement the social media signup feature. With this feature, the users can sign up using just one tap. Make sure that the app is easily accessible from the login/signup phase.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. View/Edit Profile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the ability to create a profile, the users should have the ability to view and edit their profiles as well. The users can add and edit their details, search histories, preferences, etc. This feature will not only let them personalize their profiles but also make their app experience better. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Filter &amp; Search</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users are going to use various keywords to look for the right property. This means that your app is going to need a robust search and filter feature. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11441" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11441" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11441 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property.png" alt="create a relate estate app with property searching feature" width="1650" height="1276" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-300x232.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-768x594.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-search-for-property-1024x792.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11441" class="wp-caption-text">Real estate app designed by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search feature needs to be incredibly accurate so that the users don’t have to search too long for a location. And to make it more accurate, you need to add a filter option as well. With this option (also present in Zillow mobile app), the user can filter properties by location, prices, type, ratings, etc. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Mapview</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For property searches, the map feature becomes incredibly important. With this feature the user can easily navigate new locations, routes, look for specific landmarks near the properties, etc.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11442" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11442" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11442 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view.png" alt="create your own real estate app with map view" width="1650" height="1276" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-300x232.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-768x594.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/real-estate-app-feature-map-view-1024x792.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11442" class="wp-caption-text">Created by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another unique way of integrating the map feature is through heatmaps. With heatmaps, you can display proper distribution of data about things such as crime rates in the neighborhood, traffic flow in the locality, population density around the property, etc. To integrate the heatmap feature,  you’d need to consult Google maps documentation for information on heatmap utility for android apps, and for </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iPhone app development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you need to consult the displaying overlays on a map in the iOS developer library. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. Property Details</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is property details. Of course, the users need to know all the details about the property before expressing any kind of interest in it. In the real estate app Zillow or Trulia, you will see houses needs to have the below-mentioned details listed to attract the interest of the buyers-</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How old the house is?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the condition of the house?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the offering price is?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the house</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long the owners have lived there.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many times the property has changed hands in the past.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brief history of the property.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the property details section, no buyer will show any interest in the property, so make sure that the details section is clear and detailed. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">F. Reviews &amp; Ratings</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ratings and reviews are other important features that your app needs. With this feature, the users will be able to leave their reviews on the property after viewing, about the agents on the platform and help the other users to understand the quality of service they can get from the app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">G. Image Gallery</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pictures are worth a thousand words, and even though there is a long and detailed description of the property, the buyers want to look at pictures. With the image gallery feature, sellers and agents can upload detailed images of the property to attract even more clients. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">H. Social Sharing </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With most people on social media platforms today, it is necessary that your app includes a social sharing feature as well. Because through social sharing, the sellers and agents can share a property listing on the social media platforms and get more interested buyers. </span></p>
<h2 id="How_should_be-the_UI/UX"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4th Brick: Interior Decoration for the App: the UI/UX Design</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decorating the interior of a house is important, so is the UI/UX for real estate mobile app design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the UI UX of a real estate app that is going to keep the users engaged in your app. They would move on from the app if they don’t like the design and user experience. So how are you going to make sure that the design and experience of your app stay up to the mark? Here are eight tips to design an amazing UI/UX for your app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Use Clear Images And Videos</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of clear images and videos is going to form the visual aspect of the entire app. The users definitely want to see the images before they decide if they want to go and visit the property or not. To create your own real estate app, you need to use high definition images is going to improve UI aesthetics as well. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Don’t Use Just Maps, Use Heatmaps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The map feature is a must, but there’s another way to improve it and that is through heatmaps. With the distribution of colors, heatmaps display various data such as population, crime rates, etc. The implementation of this feature is not only going to elevate the user experience but it is also going to make your app look great. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Easy To Understand Menus</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid using too complicated terms and words for menus. Buying and selling a property is a complicated task already, and adding complicated terms is going to add more pressure on the first time user. The use of easy-to-understand terms for menus will help the users feel more comfortable with your app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Easy Navigation Pattern</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The navigation flow of your app needs to be easy to understand, almost intuitive. The users shouldn’t have to scramble through your app to find what they are looking for. So make sure that the transition from one point to another on the real estate app is easy and smooth. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. 3d Walkthrough And Floor Plans</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An added bonus to the image feature, 3D walkthrough, and floor plans would help the buyers to get an actual understanding of the floor plan, how the house looks from the inside and whether it matches their requirements or not. It will help them to make a decision on if they want to check out the property in real life or not. </span></p>
<h2 id="What_should_be_the_tech_stack?"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5th Brick: The Tech Stack That Makes the Apps</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After deciding all the features and functionalities, you need to decide on the proper tech stack to implement all those interesting features on your app. Here are a few tech stacks used by apps such as Zillow mobile and Trulia to get you started in planning the tech stack for your tech stack to create real estate sites like Zillow.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audience for property apps are quite extensive, including all kinds of people. So it’s important to go with a multi-platform approach, in which care, you will need Java to develop real estate applications for android and Swift for the iOS version. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Database: you can use Postgress, PostGIS SQL to integrate the databases on the system. You can also use APIs such as SimplyRETS, iHomeFinder, etc. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For social network sharing, you will need the Facebook SDK. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can create an interactive and customizable map with the help of Mapkit. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push notification feature: Firebase SDK and Apple Push Notification. </span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Monetization_Strategy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6th Brick: How to Make Money With the Apps?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re going to spend a lot of money to create a real estate app. Get an <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app-breakdown/">estimation of how much does it cost to build an app</a> now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how are you going to earn that money back?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you choose </span><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/android-app-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android app development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or iOS, the following revenue models will generate proper revenue for you:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Advertisement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tried and tested, this monetization model has been around for a long enough time. And surely with relevant advertisements, you can generate revenue easily. However, make sure that the ads displayed are relevant to real estate, such as bank loans, mortgages, home renovation, etc. Every time any user taps on the ads you will earn a small revenue. If you want to create your own real estate app, this is your way to earn more money.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/proven-mobile-app-monetization-strategy/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11400 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/app-monetization-strategies.png" alt="app monetization ideas" width="981" height="227" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/app-monetization-strategies.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/app-monetization-strategies-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/app-monetization-strategies-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Various Fees</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can implement various fees on your application, such as listing fee when a user wants to get their property listed, extra fee from the agents on the platform to boost their profile to help them to get more clients etc. however, once again you should practice caution because having too pay too many fees will eventually annoy the users. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Premium Subscription</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, the premium subscription will enable the users to use the app to its full extent. You can offer a free trial of all the features on the app for a time period. After that time period,  the user can either keep on using the limited version of the app or they can upgrade to the premium version by paying an amount. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonus: Real Estate App And AI: A Unique Integration</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emergence of IoT came with the promise of endless possibilities, and smart homes are one of them. The ability to control different aspects of our homes remotely has made our lives easier to live. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multifaceted use of smart home apps and system are helping us to advance our lifestyle by leaps and bounds every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this article, we are going to talk about smart home systems, what they are, how the market scope looks like and ultimately, how we approach smart home app development. So without further ado, let’s get started.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Home App Development: How to Develop One?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a smart home system is different than developing a normal smartphone app. Here are the steps involved:</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lets&#8217;s talk about these in detail.</span></p>
<h2 id="Learning_how_smart_home_automation_works"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Smart Home Automation: What It Is And How It Works</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theory of smart home technology has been around for a long while, though the practical concept has been in practice since early 2000. During this time smart home devices became more affordable thanks to the emerging technology. Due to affordability, wide adaptation became possible, paving the way for better enhancement in the technology.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first-ever fully automated smart home was created by Emin Mathias in Jackson, Michigan in the USA. his home came to be known as the Push Button Manor. At this house, everything from the curtains to the dressing table lights was controlled by remotes. It was the only home in 1950 that reached a complete state of automation. Sadly though, Mathias never put his system up for sale in the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only mention-worthy attempt among them is the Microsoft home in 1990. It might not have been perfect, but with a home barcode scanner, and a time-shift TV, it came close to the development of smart homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how is the market doing now? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it worth developing smart home automation app? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at the market before we get to talking about smart home system development. </span></p>
<h2 id="Your_idea_validation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. The Expected Growth &#8211; Is Your Smart Home App Development Idea Valid?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increasing affordability and availability have helped the smart home market to grow exponentially. But how much has this market grown? And what is the expected growth for smart home technology?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the below chart, all smart home market segment except for video entertainment is going to see a double increase in worldwide shipment during 2018. It goes without saying that such growth means that the technology is only going to get more advanced.  And hence, startups are looking for <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ios-app-development/">iOS app development company</a> or someone who specializes in both Android and iOS to create smart home apps.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11120" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11120" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11120 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-growth.jpg" alt="growth of smart home app development" width="960" height="684" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-growth.jpg 960w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-growth-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-growth-768x547.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11120" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Statista</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is estimated that by the year 2022 the consumer spending on smart home devices is going to amount to $62.5 billion in North America alone. Currently, in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan is leading the smart home market thanks to its technologically advanced infrastructure. Europe is not far behind, with the popularity of smart home technology in UK growing to be 23.9% in the first quarter of 2019. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11121" style="width: 695px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11121 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-consumer-spends.png" alt="smart home app popularity area wise" width="695" height="442" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-consumer-spends.png 695w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-consumer-spends-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11121" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Statista</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology advances throughout the years, it is going to become more beneficial to invest in it. And that’s why knowing about smart home development can help you a lot more than you think. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what does it take to develop a smart home system? Let’s start the discussion.</span></p>
<h2 id="Choose_the_type_of_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Two Types Of Smart Home App That You Can Go For</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, for the successful smart home app development, you need to develop a smart home dashboard app which will enable the users to control their home automation system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are choosing android home automation app development or iOS smart home app development, When it comes to smart home apps, there are two kinds &#8211; single-tasking, and multitasking. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Single-tasking Smart Home App </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single-tasking smart home app is designed to control only one IoT device for smart home automation. With these apps, users can control only one smart home device. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11199" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11199 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/single-tasking-smart-home-app.png" alt="smart home app screen for single tasking" width="1650" height="1076" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/single-tasking-smart-home-app.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/single-tasking-smart-home-app-300x196.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/single-tasking-smart-home-app-768x501.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/single-tasking-smart-home-app-1024x668.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11199" class="wp-caption-text">Home Automation App Design by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is one problem with this solution- the users are not going to install more than one smart home devices at their home, creating a complex IoT environment. A single-tasking app would be able to control only one of the IoT devices. This means the users would have to install multiple apps, making things more complicated for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, there is one advantage, that is- developing a single-tasking app is easier than developing a multitasking app. It takes less time and resources, giving you a quick solution for your smart home system development.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Multitasking  Smart Home App</span><b> </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multitasking or universal smart home apps work with multiple smart home devices. Users can handle many smart devices simultaneously without any problems. Multitasking smart home apps offer perfect ease and efficiency to the users making them more popular. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11200" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11200 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/multi-tasking-smart-home-app.png" alt="smart home app development for multi tasking" width="1650" height="1076" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/multi-tasking-smart-home-app.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/multi-tasking-smart-home-app-300x196.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/multi-tasking-smart-home-app-768x501.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/multi-tasking-smart-home-app-1024x668.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11200" class="wp-caption-text">Multi-tasking Smart Home App visualization by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this approach needs more time, patience and resources to come to fruition. Want to check out the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/top-smart-home-apps/" target="_blank">top smart home app for 2020 in both the category</a>? </span></p>
<h2 id="Decide_the_core_features"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Let’s Talk About Core Features That You Can&#8217;t-Miss</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of these features can be a bit common, most are unique to smart home apps. Without these core features in your home automation app development, you can’t make your app work seamlessly with all your smart home devices. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Easy User Registration</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ordinary app, you will be encouraged to give the users a chance to log in and sign up using social media sites like Facebook or Google account. But in the case of a smart home IoT app, you need to make sure that the data security of the user is not compromised at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why when integrating the feature of user registration in your smart home system app, do not include social media sign up feature. Make sure that the customer creates their own unique username and password to sign up for the system. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Creating A User Profile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the user has logged in, they need to be able to create their own profile. With this profile, they would be able to control all the systems, as well as be able to create specific schedules for home automation. Make the smart home interface seamless.<br />
</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Access Configuration</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After creating a profile comes access configuration. This feature will help the users to create two kinds of profile for the home automation system &#8211; the admin profile with unlimited access to the device network and devices all around the house. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11202 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-for-smart-watch.png" alt="smart home watch app with loaded features" width="1650" height="1076" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-for-smart-watch.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-for-smart-watch-300x196.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-for-smart-watch-768x501.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-for-smart-watch-1024x668.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there is a limited user profile with limited access to all the features of the home automation system. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Onboarding Process</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT apps can be a little complicated to handle. And that’s why you should add the feature of the on-boarding process. With this feature, users can learn their way through the app easily. Remember to keep the directions easy and quick, because the users want to get on with the app as soon as possible. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Device &amp; Sensor Page</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the users have set up their profiles, they need to access the device &amp; sensor page to start controlling the smart devices around their house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be a page with a list of all the devices and sensors that are ready to be used. Through this page, the user would be able to turn smart home devices on and off along with controlling their settings as well. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">f. Room Selection</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature enables users to select one specific room, like smart home bedroom technology or for the smart home living room. And all the devices in that room to control it. This way rather than having to control specific devices one by one, they can easily control the smart home set up of one room simultaneously. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">g. Push Notification</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push notification is not a mere feature for smart home applications, it is a must-have. This feature will enable users to know all about the happenings with their smart home systems. Notifications about any changes in temperature or device settings would be sent to the users, and they can take actions based on it. This feature is going to help the user control every aspect of their home life with smart home automation. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">h. Groups And Scenes Creation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider this example &#8211; the user can create a scene for the morning. And when they wake up in the morning, they turn on the scene with a voice command, and the curtains open, lights turn off and the coffee maker starts to make coffee. This way they can make the most of home automation technology. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-make-an-app/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11205" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-to-make-an-app.png" alt="How to make an app" width="981" height="227" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-to-make-an-app.png 981w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-to-make-an-app-300x69.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-to-make-an-app-768x178.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the groups and scenes feature, the user would be able to group together certain devices, so that they can be controlled together. The user can also create different scenes specific to the time of the day. </span></p>
<h2 id="Understand_the_security_implementation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Should You Care About Security Implementation?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an ongoing joke about IoT security. And that is-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S in IoT stands for security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truly, the industry of IoT does lack security, and this can be especially dangerous for smart home devices. There are just too many unique threats a smart home system faces.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11125" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11125 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Iot-smart-home-scene.jpg" alt="results of smart home app development" width="740" height="651" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Iot-smart-home-scene.jpg 740w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Iot-smart-home-scene-300x264.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11125" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Joyoftech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to avoid being the butt of the security joke in the smart home IoT system, then you have to think about implementing security. And when you are thinking about integrating security, you need to follow the below directives-</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Authenticate All Services And Endpoints</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any person or the device must be authenticated by the admin before being able to interact with the smart home network. This way you can prevent hackers with malicious intents from hacking into the network and taking control of the system. In case you are wondering how to make android app for home automation, you just cannot miss this feature.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Encrypt All Transmission Data</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart home IoT deals with a lot of data and this data need to be protected. And that’s why you need to make sure that the data collected and transmitted by your smart home system is being encrypted. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11201" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11201" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11201 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-dashboard.png" alt="smart home app development and its dashboard" width="1650" height="1076" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-dashboard.png 1650w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-dashboard-300x196.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-dashboard-768x501.png 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smart-home-app-dashboard-1024x668.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11201" class="wp-caption-text">IoT Smart Home Application Dashboard by Unified Infotech</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, the plaintext data would be vulnerable and would be open to hackers with malicious intent. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Continuous Updates For The Apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing updates for smart home devices are hard since there is no way for the users to update the devices manually. And that’s why you need to create an over the air automatic update system, through which the devices will be updated automatically. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Update Open Source IoT Libraries</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using open source IoT libraries for smart home app development, then you must know they are susceptible to vulnerabilities. And that’s why you need to create a plan for the open-source library updates and continue it. Keep an eye on any published vulnerabilities in the open-source elements you might have used and keep on publishing security updates for any security issues. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Integrate Security From The Beginning</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When building a smart home system, security has to be integrated from the beginning. It can not be a secondary choice. As a developer, you must understand the security concerns of the user and the various threats they are facing to implement the solutions to those problems in the system from the beginning. </span></p>
<h2 id="Choose_the_right_data_storage_type"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. What Should be Your Data Storage Type? Cloud or local</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A home automation system functions by collecting and processing data. Your smart home system needs to store this data somewhere, and for that, you have two options. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Cloud storage </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">with cloud storage, the data are stored in a cloud storage system, which can be accessed from anywhere anytime if the user has an internet connection. Another advantage of this system would be the ability to recover data even in the case of hardware/software failure. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Local storage </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">in this case, the collected data is going to be stored on an FTP server or built-in memory storage. While this might seem like the safer alternative for data storage, it will also increase power and battery consumption, eventually compromising your device&#8217;s health. </span></p>
<h2 id="The_smart_home_components_to_know_about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. What Are The Smart Home Components That You Should Know About?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is being called a smart home system, there are bound to be multiple components to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To function seamlessly, smart home systems need a number of devices, all connected to each other through the home IoT network. These devices can be classified into three categories.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. The Central Hub </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central hub is the main device, the brain of the entire system. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11137" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11137" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11137 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google-smart-home-central-hub.jpg" alt="Google smart home central hub" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google-smart-home-central-hub.jpg 1200w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google-smart-home-central-hub-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google-smart-home-central-hub-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google-smart-home-central-hub-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11137" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Alphr</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central hub is a device that works as a smart home control panel and creates a connection between the smart home app and the rest of the devices. Make sure the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/">mobile app development company in Casablanca</a> you choose is aware of it.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Sensors </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smart home sensors are necessary devices that receive intel about the external conditions, such as the state of humidity and temperature around the house, water leakage features, motion sensors, etc.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11138" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11138" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11138 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Smart-Sensors-by-Amazon-for-smart-home-app-development.jpg" alt="Smart Sensors by Amazon for smart home app development" width="600" height="374" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Smart-Sensors-by-Amazon-for-smart-home-app-development.jpg 600w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Smart-Sensors-by-Amazon-for-smart-home-app-development-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11138" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Homestratosphere</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sensors are used to detect problems around the house that needs to be fixed. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Actuators </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actuators are the devices that are performing the actions you ask them to do. Such as the sprinkler system turning on when there is smoke, as well as the blinds closing themselves when you want them to close.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11139" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11139" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11139 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/philips-hue-for-smart-homes.jpg" alt="philips hue for smart homes" width="621" height="464" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/philips-hue-for-smart-homes.jpg 621w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/philips-hue-for-smart-homes-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11139" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Meethue</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three categories of devices together make up a smart home system. But how are they going to stay connected with each other and communicate? For that, they need a connectivity option, and you can choose one from several of them.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Wifi</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is probably the best and most popular way of connecting the smart home devices to the gateway. Most devices today come with wifi compatibility, although it might burn too much battery and energy to run the devices on wifi all the time. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Z-Wave </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by <a href="http://www.zen-sys.com/" target="_blank">Zensys</a>, Z-Wave is a mesh network that helps the home automation devices to connect to each other. With Z-wave, devices use low-energy radio energy, which ultimately saves battery and energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Z-Wave, users get a large open-air operating range of 90 meters outdoors, and the operating range of more than 24 meters indoors. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">f. Bluetooth</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standard technology for exchanging data with a fixed mobile device, Bluetooth can be considered as one of the connectivity solutions for smart home IoT. with Bluetooth, users can easily control smart home devices from their smartphones and tablets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Bluetooth, users can save batter and energy because it is a low battery consuming connectivity technology. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">g. Zigbee </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee" target="_blank">Zigbee</a> is one of the most convenient wireless protocols used for smart home automation. Most of the recent smart home devices are compatible with this connectivity protocol. However, Zigbee works at a 2.4GHz frequency, which is similar to WiFi and Bluetooth. Which is why there can be network interferences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have discussed the smart home system components and connectivity options, it’s time to come down to the real issue at hand- how to develop a smart home system. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonus: Best Practices That We follow to Develop Smart Home Automation App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To develop a smart home system that will capture the market as well as become a user favorite is not easy, and we at SCS INFO recognize this challenge.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. The Case Of Interoperability</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market is saturated with home IoT devices. And that’s why we consider the matter of interoperability seriously. Choosing a smart home app development process that would work harmoniously with other smart home systems in the market is the key to providing ease of use to the users. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Using The IoT Collected Data</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smart home devices are collecting and transmitting a lot of data. And we make sure to analyze this data to understand how we can improve our smart home solutions for the maximum ease and comfort of our users. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Creating A Scalable Product</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When developing, we are not only thinking about the present but also about the future scalability of the product. We make sure to use technology and tech stack that would help us to better our products in the future. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s Your Take</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what&#8217;s the end word in smart home system development?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though technology is old enough, the implementation is experiencing a serious revolution. There may be many opportunities in the industry, but at the same time, there are many risks and challenges. The development process for home IoT systems is not as simple as developing ordinary smartphone apps. And that’s why you need to be careful going into the development process. </span></p>

<h2 id="How_does_a_dog_walking_app_work"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Dog Walking App: How Does it Work? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An amazing use of the Uber for X application model, the dog walking app is making it easy for busy dog parents to get walkers easily whenever they want. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11074" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11074" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11074 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net.png" alt="on demand dog walking app by AI robot" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net.png 800w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net-300x225.png 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/drone_dude_kit8-net-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11074" class="wp-caption-text">Source: https://dribbble.com/shots/5687141-Drone-dude-walking-with-dog</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to any on-demand delivery app, with these dog walking platforms, the users register themselves, with adequate details about them and their dog. They can add detailed notes about their dogs, which might include information on vets and medications, leash, collars, and harness, etc. After registering, the user can book a walk or ask for a dog walker and they will be matched with a walker near them who can take care of the dog when the pet parents can’t. Uber for dog walking solution has made this easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now dog walking app platforms are extremely popular, among both the dog owners and dog walkers. Because it happens to be a great source of earning money, as well as hanging out with dogs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry though, making such a dog walking app is actually very easy. All you have to do is to follow the below steps or contact a professional dog walking app development service.</span></p>
<h2 id="Market_analysis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Will it be Profitable to Develop Another Dog Walking App?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, we all know how much dogs are loved and cherished by their owners, but what does that have to do with the rising popularity of the dog walking apps? Is developing a prosperous pet care platform really profitable?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, in order to understand the rising popularity of the on demand dog walking app, we have to look at two different kinds of statistics. The first one is, of course, the number of households in the US that own dogs and the second are the average numbers of hours a person has to work every week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to APPA’s national pet owners survey 2019-2020, around</span><a href="https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 63.4 million households in the USA owns a dog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And according to this </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/323441/average-hours-worked-per-week-by-full-time-us-workers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statistic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least 40% of workers have to work 40+ hours every week. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11056" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11056" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11056 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/work-hours-in-a-week.png" alt="work hours in a week.png" width="725" height="592" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/work-hours-in-a-week.png 725w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/work-hours-in-a-week-300x245.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11056" class="wp-caption-text">Source Statista</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we consider these two stats, you’ll see that most of the dog owners have to work more than 8 hours every day. And on top of those 8 hours, they also have tons of social and personal things to do. And even though they do love their dogs, these things are still important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to these apps, people, especially those who have too much to do every day, can rest assured that their pets will be taken care of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few reasons why dog-walking apps are becoming so famous.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time-saving &amp; Efficient</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Way Of Earning</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase In Business For Dog Sitters And Daycares</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Figuring_out_the_basic_features"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Basic Features That You Need for an MVP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, you have to sort out and implement the basic and necessary feature for your app. This would answer how to develop an on-demand dog walking app in the first place.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11057" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development.jpg" alt="on demand dog walking app development like Uber" width="638" height="641" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development.jpg 621w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dog-walking-app-development-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can already tell, a dog walking app is a very feature-driven app. These features need to be designed to make it easy for the owners to use the app. And that’s why we have listed below some basic features that your dog walking app needs.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Sign Up/set Up A Profile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any Uber-like app, your app should have the feature of signing up and setting up a personal account. This is a must-have feature because it will be easier for the owners to manage the walks and sitters they book, schedule the bookings and cancel in case they don’t need a sitter anymore. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Inserting Information About The Dog</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature would enable the users to add special notes on their dogs to their app profile. These notes can be on anything, from their behavior quirks to any medicines they might need, or any allergies they might have. These notes are going to further help the designated walker to take care of the pup while on a walk. </span></p>
<h3>c. Booking A Walk</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you need this feature for your app to be called a dog walking uber app. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users should be able to book a walk easily and efficiently. Keep in mind the time factor for implementing an easy walk booking feature on your app. It is an important and the main feature to build your on-demand dog walking app solution.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. GPS Tracking</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this feature, the users would be able to track their dog on their walk and would also be able to check the route the walker has taken. This is another convenient feature for those anxious dog parents who are not exactly assured about having a stranger walk their dog.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Walk Log</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the walk log feature, the dog walkers can keep a log of events that happened on the walk. These records can include pee-poop logs, any other dogs they met on the walk, duration of walking, water breaks, whether the dog played any games or not. With this, the user would have an easier time keeping a track, which might come in handy. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">f. In-app Payments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the in-app payment feature, the users can easily pay off the walkers through the app. It means that the users don’t have to hand over cash or go through complicated back transfers. They can just pay using their debit or credit card through the app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">g. Ratings And Reviews</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can leave reviews and ratings based on their experience. These ratings would help the dog walkers to get even more assigned walks. Additionally, the users can express additional tips concerns about a certain walker if they have a bad experience. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">h. Scheduled Walks</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature lets the users make a one-time booking and schedule regular walks for a longer time span. This is a convenient feature for those who for some reason or other can not go take their pet dogs for regular walks.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Push Notifications</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, push notifications are important because how else would the user stay alerted about everything? From the walker picking up the dog to all the actions that happen on the walk, cancellation, successful bookings, payment confirmation, all the information needs to reach the user in a convenient way. </span></p>
<h2 id="Advanced_features_to_make_your_app_stand_out"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Advanced And Unique Features for On-demand Dog Walking App Development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the above features are the very basic features of an on demand dog walking app, your app needs some advanced features to truly stand out and become one of the top dog walking apps. So let’s see what kind of advanced features you need for your app to stand out for the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/mobile-app-development-new-york/">mobile app development</a> for dog walking.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Filtering Feature</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature is going to help both the owners and dog walkers to filter and sort through the walkers and walk requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a much needed yet much-ignored feature. The dog owners can filter out walkers depending on various factors and choose one from the pool of walkers they prefer. The walkers too can choose and filter through assigned dogs based on the area and dog breeds. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Curated Professional Advice</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be a valuable feature for those first-time dog parents. With daily tips on grooming, training, and diets, the daily tips and notes from professional vets, trainers and groomers can be very useful to the dog parents. Extra points if these daily tips can be modified to match specific breeds of dogs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Doggy Playdate</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like human beings, dogs too need daily socializing. While dog parks can be a great place for this, often there are bigger dogs there who can intimidate all the other dogs and ruin the fun.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11060 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dog-playdate-on-app.jpg" alt="play date in on demand dog walking app " width="640" height="439" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dog-playdate-on-app.jpg 640w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dog-playdate-on-app-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why being able to set up a dog playdate can be an amazing way for the pet parents to set up playdates between two or more dogs so that they can get the much-needed socialization they need. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Sales &amp; Events Notifications </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users can be notified whenever there are any specific events or sales going on nearby. This will not only be a fun way to spend time with their dogs but also help the owners to meet other dog owners. Events such as dog show, special training campaign, service dog training, along with a sale on toys and dog food can be included in this feature. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Community Feature</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group or community feature can help the dog parents and walkers on the platform to come together in one group and exchange information about caring for dogs and important notifications. This will be a good way for everyone to communicate with each other.</span></p>
<h2 id="UX_design_needs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing An Attractive UI/UX to Create Your Dog Walking App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it is a dog walking app, you need to pay enough attention to the <a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/services/ui-ux-design/">UI/UX design</a>. The ease and flow of the user interface will determine whether the user is going to come back to your app next time they need a dog walker or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that the User interface is easy to understand and navigate through. Booking a dog walker is not going to be as easy as ordering a cap or food. Even though the app model is a lot similar, the interface design needs to be different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there are going to be a lot of details to put in regarding the owner and the dog as well, make the forms precise and easy to understand. No need for fancy use of language or extra images. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that at the end of the day it is an app for busy dog parents to get a walker for their dogs in an efficient way. They are not going to be impressed with extra <strong>effects</strong> and <strong>animation</strong> if it does not help them to schedule a walk quickly. </span></p>
<h2 id="Extra_security_Necessities"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Safety Measures To Take &#8211; Make Your App Secure</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dog service app still poses a lot of security risks to both the dog parents and the walkers. And to make it more secure for them, you should integrate some extra security features when you go for on-demand dog walking app development.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Background Checks For The Walkers </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been more than one </span><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/dog-stolen-wag-walker" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where the pet care provider from popular dog walking services fell short of the quality these companies promised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering all the weird incidents that created headlines like </span><a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2345986/cautionary-tale-about-dog-walking-apps" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dog-walking apps have a shaky reputation among the users. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Safe Way To Hand Over The Keys </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, the dog walkers booked through the app are arriving at your apartment when you are not home. In such a case, they need access to your apartment. Apps like Wag! Provide the owners with a lockbox, with a security code facility. The users keep the keys of their apartment inside this box and lock it with a code. The security code is only shared with the walker books, through the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though this system seems full-proof, it isn’t. There have been many </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-thinks-robber-accessed-home-dog-walking-app/story?id=65405550" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">instances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where the dog walkers, with access to the security code, have robbed the house. And that’s why you need a safer way of handing over the keys. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. Insurance For Pets And The House</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pet-owner-blames-death-of-her-dog-on-rover-app/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tragic incident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the pet parent left their blind dog with a sitter booked through one of the popular dog walking uber app, but the dog fell off of a two-story building and passed away. Not to mention the various robbery incidents that have happened to many dog owners. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Live Cam And Photo Posting Feature During The Walk</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The live cam and photo sharing feature can actually guarantee the real-time safety and security of the beloved pet. Having the dog walker go live through the app when they are picking the pup up for the walk and dropping them back home, can satisfy users to know that their dog is safe and sound. </span></p>
<h2 id="How_to_earn_from_your_app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. How To Earn From Your App</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the main aim of creating an app is to monetize it. And we take care of this in our dog walking app solution. When it comes to monetizing an app for dog care on demand, you need to know about the various monetization models. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Make Money With Marketplace Model</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You create a platform, where all the other pet care providers can register and get bookings independently. All they have to do is pay a small charge to the platform for every booking and sitting completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is basically a peer to peer-based payment model which helps the users to pay for the pet care service to the walker through the app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Create Your Pet Care Agency App &#8211; The Agency Model</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is another model for this app, which is the agency model. With this model of monetization, you hire pet sitters and walkers, provide extensive training and eventually employ them as pet care providers. Unlike the marketplace model, the walkers here are not independent workers, rather they would work under your platform. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/top-app-monetization-ideas/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10809 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-monetization-ideas.jpg" alt="on demand dog walking app development" width="635" height="146" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-monetization-ideas.jpg 635w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/app-monetization-ideas-300x69.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">c. One Time Sign Up Fee</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is for both service providers and pet parents. Having them pay a one-time signup fee would not only help you to raise revenue, but it will also help them take advantage of the various features of your platform.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">d. Annual Fees For Users</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recurring annual fee to get access to premium features is a common monetization model for the most on-demand app. And that’s why utilizing it for your app can be a great way of raising revenue</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Product Advertisement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can easily monetize your app by showing relevant advertisements to the users. Getting into paid partnerships with various dog food or dog toy companies. However, make sure before you get into a partnership that the company is reliable and doesn’t endorse any kind of harmful product to the pet parents. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">f. Selling Merchandise</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course,  selling merchandise on your dog platform is an amazing way of raising revenue. People consider their pets as part of their family, so they are obviously going to spend money on buying various toys and clothes for their precious family members. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">g. Charging extra For Platform Assured Services</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this service, they provide extra guarantee and assurance to the user, in return for a specific charge. You can also do this for your users. Every time they book a dog walker, users can choose the assured service so that they have a better guarantee that nothing would go wrong.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular Dog Walking App In The Market</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it is a relatively new market, there are still a few chart-topping dogs walking apps in the market. These platforms will become your direct competitors should you choose to develop a dog platform. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wag</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wag! Has been one of the top dog walking apps for a while now. Founded back in 2014, it has been named the uber for dog walking. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11076" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11076" style="width: 1033px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11076 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wag-screens.jpg" alt="on demand dog walking app development like Wag" width="1033" height="506" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wag-screens.jpg 1033w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wag-screens-300x147.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wag-screens-768x376.jpg 768w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wag-screens-1024x502.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1033px) 100vw, 1033px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11076" class="wp-caption-text">Source: iTunes</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a few recent events have put the reputation of the company in jeopardy. Even then, the company raised $300 million in venture capital funds in 2018 from Softbank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can schedule a dog walking service according to their schedule or get an emergency service within 15 minutes. The platform also offers other features such as dog notes, and instructions for the walker, live notifications and walk reports, etc. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rover</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2011, Rover has been in this market for eight years, and it is one of the top players in the dog walking uber app segment. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11077" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11077" style="width: 1008px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11077 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rover-screens.jpg" alt="on demand dog walking app development like Rover" width="1008" height="507" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rover-screens.jpg 1008w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rover-screens-300x151.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rover-screens-768x386.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11077" class="wp-caption-text">Source: iTunes</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can contact and message sitters and walkers right from the app and get easy replies. With the app, they can also perform easy and hassle-free payments. The Rover app also provides a map feature so that the user can track the walking route chosen by the walker. Along with that, there is a live notification feature for pee/poo, food and water, and additional personalized notes from the walkers or sitters. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barkley Pets</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also launched in 2011, Barkly Pets had a simple aim, to provide the dog parents with quality pet care services. It is a great example of a successful on demand dog walking app development.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11078" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11078" style="width: 914px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11078 size-full" src="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/barkly-screens.jpg" alt="on demand dog walking app development like barkly" width="914" height="464" srcset="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/barkly-screens.jpg 914w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/barkly-screens-300x152.jpg 300w, https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/barkly-screens-768x390.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11078" class="wp-caption-text">Source: iTunes</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the pet care services from 6 am to 10 pm 365 days, Barkly pets also offer a 24/7 customer care service for their clients. The users can meet the dog walker to get to know them before entrusting their precious family member to them. It is very easy to manage all the bookings, scheduling, and billing within the app. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what is the one truly necessary thing you need to create a successful dog walking app?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is true love and compassion for animals. You must know that when you are taking care of someone’s dogs, you are not just taking care of an animal, but their family members.
